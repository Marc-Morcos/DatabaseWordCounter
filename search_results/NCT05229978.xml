  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this qualitative study is to create a better understanding of patients'&#xD;
      mental model of web 2.0 based consent types (such as Dynamic Consent). The researchers will&#xD;
      focus especially on those people who - plausibly - require adjusted communication&#xD;
      particularities and interaction modalities due to a cognitive impairment stemming from a&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disease. Taking into account the specific characteristics of patients with&#xD;
      MCI due to AD and mild dementia due to AD, the goal of this study is to investigate how to&#xD;
      communicate according to patients' personal skills and capabilities and identify both the&#xD;
      proper support mechanisms for engagement 2.0 consent as well as feedback mechanisms (return&#xD;
      of research results). Through a focus group &amp; interview setup, this study will discern design&#xD;
      requirements and propose design recommendations for the (future) development of engagement&#xD;
      2.0 interfaces.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increasingly data-driven character of digital health &amp; clinical research has put&#xD;
      traditional patient consent models under heightened scrutiny. Static, paper-based consent&#xD;
      forms have become hopelessly outdated in a complex health research landscape which is marked&#xD;
      by (a) an unprecedented prevalence of (multimodal, patient-specific) data, (b) increased&#xD;
      (re-)use of routinely collected clinical data for secondary purposes; and (c) incremental&#xD;
      usage of novel data-driven research methods such as Machine Learning. Patient involvement and&#xD;
      consent should be (and is being) revised against the backdrop of this new data-driven&#xD;
      clinical ecosystem and its particularities. Drawing from the interactive &quot;web 2.0&quot; model,&#xD;
      technology-driven &quot;engagement 2.0&quot; approaches have been proposed to move away from static,&#xD;
      mono-directional and single point consent, towards more interactive, granular and dynamic&#xD;
      forms of consent. Over the past years, multiple projects (e.g. RUDY, PEER, SPRAINED, CTRL)&#xD;
      have prototyped and implemented such engagement 2.0 consent models. While high-level user&#xD;
      feedback was overall positive, attempts to more deeply understand patients' or databank&#xD;
      participants' views on sharing their data for research purposes through such interfaces are&#xD;
      scarce. Moreover, no studies have looked at specific subsets of patients who might require&#xD;
      additional attention in this context, such as those who suffer from cognitive impairing&#xD;
      conditions. Through focus groups and interviews, this study aims to create a better&#xD;
      understanding of patients' mental model of web 2.0 based consent types and especially of&#xD;
      those people who - plausibly - require adjusted communication particularities and interaction&#xD;
      modalities due to a cognitive impairment stemming from a neurodegenerative disease. Taking&#xD;
      into account the specific characteristics of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the goal&#xD;
      is to investigate how to communicate according to patients' personal skills and capabilities&#xD;
      and identify both the proper support mechanisms for engagement 2.0 consent as well as&#xD;
      feedback mechanisms (return of research results).&#xD;
