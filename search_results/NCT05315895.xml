  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers plain to build a large-scale, longitudinal, prospective cohort characterized&#xD;
      by TCM dampness syndrome. With the biobank of this cohort the investigators want to find the&#xD;
      causality between TCM dampness syndrome and clinical chronic diseases and a new way to treat&#xD;
      clinical disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      DACOS is a national large- scale, longitudinal, multi-center, prospective, cohort study of&#xD;
      natural person aged 35 to 75. The baseline survey and the follow-up surveys will be conducted&#xD;
      in 5 areas covering the eastern, northern, western, southern and middle parts of China. In&#xD;
      this study 100,000 natural person will be regularly followed up for 5 years(visited once a&#xD;
      year), with the loss rate ≤15%. Three parts will be carried in the form of interview,&#xD;
      physical examination and biological sample collection. During the interview, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to do some questionnaires to learn participants' demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, life style, disease history, healthy condition(EQ-5D-5L, SDS,), cognition&#xD;
      state(AD-8, MMSE, MoCA) and the results of TCM syndrome differentiation(Score of Dampness&#xD;
      syndrome and TCM constitution scale). All biological specimens (including blood, feces,&#xD;
      urine, saliva and tongue coating) will be collected and stored in the biological resource&#xD;
      center until researchers request their use. With the building up of this cohort, the&#xD;
      researchers will analyze the causality between dampness syndrome and specific chronic&#xD;
      diseases such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, cancer, dementia and so on.&#xD;

    <description>This study will pay attention to the emerging situation of clinical chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, dementia, etc. Each follow-up the researchers will record the incidence of the emerging diseases of interviewees' by questionnaire including the name of the disease, time of onset and treatments.</description>

    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>MoCA is a brief, 30-question test that helps healthcare professionals detect cognitive impairments very early on, allowing for faster diagnosis and patient care. MoCA is the most sensitive test available for detecting Alzheimer's disease, measuring executive functions and multiple cognitive domains. The value range 0-30: higher scores mean a better Cognitine. The score above 26 is considered the normal congnitive level</description>

    <measure>European Quality of Life 5-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D comprises five dimensions of health: mobility, ability to self-care, ability to undertake usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. . EQ-5D-5L, includes five levels of severity for each dimension (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems). The value range 0-100: higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
