  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since September 1st, 2009, Taiwan has begun to pay attention to the care of patients with&#xD;
      organ failure, dementia and the elderly, and brought eight of non-cancer terminal patients&#xD;
      into health insurance subsidies to implement the goal of universal palliative care and local&#xD;
      aging. Taiwan has entered the aged society since March 2018, become the heavy burden of&#xD;
      expenditure in Taiwan because of the health care needs and costs associated with the rapid&#xD;
      aging of the population. With advanced medical technology, when facing inevitable death&#xD;
      situation, should not use too much medical treatment on terminally ill patients. The waste of&#xD;
      medical resources and bring both patients and family members so much pain. In Taiwan, people&#xD;
      have misconception about tranquil palliative care. The low rate of home palliative care for&#xD;
      non-terminal cancer patients. The purpose of this study is investigating the eight non-cancer&#xD;
      terminal caregivers' knowledge, attitudes and service intentions of palliative care, and&#xD;
      getting the result by research intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a randomized experimental research design was applied by two-group pre-and&#xD;
      post-test. The targets are the eight non-cancer terminal caregivers in a home care&#xD;
      institution of a regional teaching hospital located in Yilan. Targets' ID end with odd&#xD;
      numbers are in experimental group received shared mode intervention, and even numbers are in&#xD;
      control group received home routine care. The experimental group was implementing measures of&#xD;
      weekly shared mode intervention in 20 to 60 minutes for six weeks; the control group started&#xD;
      to implement measures of home care medical instructions booklet in the third week. The&#xD;
      content of the outcome measurement questionnaire includes: basic information of the eight&#xD;
      non-cancer terminal caregivers, the palliative care knowledge scale, the palliative care&#xD;
      attitude scale, and palliative care service initiation intention scale. Data were analyzed by&#xD;
      statistical methods such as descriptive analysis, independent sample t-test, paired-samples&#xD;
      t-test, Pearson correlation analysis and one-way ANOVA.&#xD;

      The valid sample of this study consisted of 60 individuals, 31 females and 29 males, with a&#xD;
      mean age of 56.3 years, and one attrition (death), with an attrition rate of 1.67%. The&#xD;
      results showed that (1) there was a significant difference between the experimental group and&#xD;
      the control group in the mean pre-test and post-test of hospice and palliative care knowledge&#xD;
      (t=-4.973, p=0.00) and palliative attitude (t=-2.424, p=0.02). (2) There were significant&#xD;
      differences in the pre-test and post-tests of hospice and palliative care knowledge&#xD;
      (p=0.000), hospice and palliative care attitude (p=0.008), and hospice and palliative care&#xD;
      intention (p=0.009) in the experimental group; there were significant differences in the&#xD;
      pre-test and post-tests of hospice and palliative care knowledge in the control group&#xD;
      (p=0.002). (3) There were significant differences in hospice knowledge, attitude, intention&#xD;
      and hospice initiation between subjects in the experimental group with and without a signed&#xD;
      DNR or ACP, indicating that those with a signed DNR or ACP had higher scores in hospice&#xD;
      knowledge, attitude, intention and hospice initiation, which was a significant factor in the&#xD;
      results of this study; there were significant differences in hospice knowledge and intention&#xD;
      between the control group in terms of education level. This means that higher education&#xD;
      level, higher score of hospice knowledge and intention. (4) After the shared model study&#xD;
      intervention, 24 (72.7%) signed the DNR or ACP consent form and 16 (48.5%) initiated hospice&#xD;
      services; after the home care routine care, 3 (11.1%) signed the DNR or ACP consent form and&#xD;
      0 (0%) initiated hospice services.&#xD;
