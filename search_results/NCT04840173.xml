    <textblock>
      Study will be conducted to determine if caregivers who use music at home will feel less&#xD;
      burden and whether the person they are caring for will demonstrate decreased symptoms of&#xD;
      dementia. Caregivers will participate in a series of psycho-educational trainings for six&#xD;
      weeks. During this time, caregivers will learn how to use singing, music listening and music&#xD;
      with movement with their family member. Caregivers should feel less stressed and a decreased&#xD;
      sense of burden. The care recipient should appear happier with less occurrences of depression&#xD;
      or restlessness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Our study will incorporate caregivers and their care receivers who are diagnosed with&#xD;
      dementia and agitation co-occurring depression. The primary study outcomes are the following:&#xD;
      caregiver burden, measured with the Zarit Caregiver Burden Intervention; mood, measured with&#xD;
      the Cornell-Brown Scale for Quality of Life; agitation, measured with the Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Inventory Questionnaire; and focus group and diaries will be used to gain a descriptive&#xD;
      account of caregiver experiences of facilitation of music intervention. Assessment time frame&#xD;
      is focus group with caregivers, then pre-tests for baseline. Before the first workshop,&#xD;
      caregivers will be asked to participate in a focus group with other caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following pre-tests and focus group, caregivers will participate in a 6-week classroom&#xD;
      workshop including the following topics: adding singing and music with movement to address&#xD;
      mood or agitation, music listening to assist with transitions or difficult tasks,&#xD;
      implementing background music for compliance during activities of daily living, creating&#xD;
      individualized playlists/interventions to address undesirable behaviors, and the use of an&#xD;
      MP3 player . The 6-week workshop will take place in person or via Zoom. Potential&#xD;
      participants will be asked to meet for an hour, once weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the workshops, caregivers will be taught music-based interventions that involve adding&#xD;
      singing and music with movement to address mood or agitation, music listening to assist with&#xD;
      transitions or difficult tasks, background music for compliance and the creation of&#xD;
      individualized playlists to address undesirable behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This psychosocial intervention will teach caregivers to incorporate a music-based&#xD;
      intervention. The music-based intervention is a non-invasive program that involves singing,&#xD;
      music with movement and music listening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During these 6 weeks, caregivers will implement the music intervention with the care&#xD;
      recipient and document weekly diaries. There will be a 3 month follow up designated for&#xD;
      participants to repeat the completion of the questionnaires, Zarit Caregiver Burden&#xD;
      Interview, Cornell-Brown Scale for Quality of Life, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory&#xD;
      Questionnaire. These questions will be about participants' moods, agitation level or&#xD;
      caregiver burden. This information will be collected in person at Menorah from potential&#xD;
      caregiver participants. Principal Investigator will call to gather this data from the&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;
