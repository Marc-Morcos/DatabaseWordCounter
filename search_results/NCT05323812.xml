      This is an exploratory, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase IIa proof of&#xD;
      concept study to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of TW001 in&#xD;
      patients with mild AD. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to TW001 and placebo. Treatments will&#xD;
      be given in a fasted state once daily for 90 days. The total duration of the clinical trial&#xD;
      will be approximately 4 months per patient.&#xD;

             (i) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile consistent with AD (an Aβ42 concentration of&#xD;
             &lt;1000 pg/mL AND phosphorylated tau (p-tau) &gt;19 pg/mL, or a ratio of p-tau/Aβ42 of&#xD;
             ≥0.020) taken during the screening period prior to the day of the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication, or&#xD;
