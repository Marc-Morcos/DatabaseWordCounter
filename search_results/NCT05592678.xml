      The goal of this clinical trial is to demonstrate potential improvements in clinical trial&#xD;
      methods relating to dementia and cognitive decline. The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can an intervention's outcome be better assessed by a latent variable (&quot;δ&quot;) integrating&#xD;
           cognitive performance with functional status?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can latent biomarkers of δ guide the selection of an intervention that will modulate&#xD;
           dementia severity?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can a latent variable, derived from information collected remotely from caregivers,&#xD;
           preselect subjects most likely to respond to the intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the effect of the intervention in fact medicated by changes in the targeted&#xD;
           biomarker?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this case, the biomarker will be a latent variable derived from several proteins measured&#xD;
      in blood (i.e., so-called &quot;adipokines&quot;). The intervention will be donepezil, a medication&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, but only recently associated with&#xD;
      adipokine changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with cognitive impairment and their caregivers will be interviewed by telephone&#xD;
      and those with cognitive impairment will be treated for six-months with donepezil. On the&#xD;
      basis of the caregiver's report, the cognitively impaired subjects will be assigned to two&#xD;
      groups based on a prediction of their response to donepezil. Researchers will compare those&#xD;
      groups to see if dementia severity, as measured by δ, improves in predicted responders, and&#xD;
      whether the change in the d-score is mediated by changes in adipokines.&#xD;

      Title: &quot;Novel Methods for Clinical rials in Dementia and Cognitive Decline&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description: This is a double-blind assignment open label clinical trial to test novel&#xD;
      approaches to clinical trial methods. 1) The study team will pre-select cases most likely to&#xD;
      benefit from adipokine modulation by a telephone assessment. 2) The study team will&#xD;
      pre-select subjects with clinical and preclinical dementia most likely to respond to therapy.&#xD;
      3) The study team will test the drug donepezil's effect on dementia severity, in predicted&#xD;
      responders and non-responders, as measured by a latent dementia phenotype &quot;δ' and 4) test a&#xD;
      latent Adipokines biomarker construct as a mediator of their association in the predicted&#xD;
      responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To test novel clinical trial methods relevant to dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test donepezil's effect on dementia severity as measured by δ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test Adipokines as a mediator of donepezil's effect on δ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary Endpoint: Dementia severity as measured by the latent phenotype &quot;δ&quot; using&#xD;
      the &quot;dTEL&quot; homolog.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Change in Adipokines as a mediator of donepezil's effect on dTEL.&#xD;
