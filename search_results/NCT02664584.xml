      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD), osteoporosis and dementia are chronic diseases of ageing that&#xD;
      impact adversely on the lives of those affected and have major health, social and economic&#xD;
      consequences. A number of factors are considered to be implicated in these diseases, ranging&#xD;
      from the more established factors to those that are less well recognised. Lifestyle factors&#xD;
      such as diet, body weight, smoking, physical activity and years of education are acknowledged&#xD;
      as risk factors for the development of these chronic diseases of aging. Emerging research&#xD;
      suggests that elevated homocysteine and/or sub-optimal status of the metabolically related&#xD;
      B-vitamins (folate, vitamin B12, B6 and riboflavin) may be associated with a higher risk of&#xD;
      age-related disease. The interplay between relevant genetic and nutrient factors&#xD;
      (gene-nutrient interactions) is considered to be highly relevant in the development (and&#xD;
      prevention) of chronic diseases of ageing, however this relatively new area of research is as&#xD;
      yet poorly understood. The collection of clinical, lifestyle, nutritional and genetic data on&#xD;
      large numbers of patients would permit the investigation of those nutrients which interact&#xD;
      with specific genes to increase the likelihood of a person developing chronic diseases of&#xD;
      ageing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the TUDA study is to collect detailed clinical, lifestyle, dietary, genetic and&#xD;
      biochemical data to investigate gene-nutrient interactions (particularly from the perspective&#xD;
      of the B-vitamins and vitamin D/calcium) in the development of CVD, osteoporosis and dementia&#xD;
      by studying older adults exhibiting the early stages of these common diseases, namely&#xD;
      hypertension, low bone mineral density, and early memory loss, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim (follow up TUDA investigation):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this longitudinal investigation is to re-assess clinical, nutritional, genetic and&#xD;
      biochemical factors in relation to the progression of disease outcomes in TUDA study&#xD;
      participants, in subsequent years after initial investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 6000 non-institutionalised older Irish people aged over 60 years with early&#xD;
      predictors of either dementia, stroke and osteoporosis (namely early memory loss, high blood&#xD;
      pressure and low bone mineral density, respectively) recruited from three centres (St James's&#xD;
      Hospital Dublin, Ulster University Coleraine and The Clinical Translational Research and&#xD;
      Innovation Centre (C-TRIC), Londonderry) across Ireland. Non-fasting blood samples were&#xD;
      collected from all subjects and routine blood biochemistry profiles and biomarkers of&#xD;
      relevance to B vitamin and vitamin D status were measured. Supplement use was recorded and a&#xD;
      targeted food frequency questionnaire was used to record dietary intakes of specific vitamins&#xD;
      of interest (folate, B12, B6, riboflavin and D) from major food sources, particularly&#xD;
      fortified foods. Physiological function tests including blood pressure, bone health (DXA&#xD;
      scans) and cognitive function tests and anthropometric measures were also taken.&#xD;
