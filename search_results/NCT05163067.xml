      The study aims to investigate the effect of a long-term combined aerobic exercise and&#xD;
      cognitive training program on cognitive function, daily function, psychosocial status, and&#xD;
      neural plasticity in seniors with genetic susceptibility for Alzheimer's Disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and the leading cause of&#xD;
      disability in people older than 65 years worldwide. However, there is no effective&#xD;
      disease-modifying therapy currently. Therefore, improvement of cognitive function in people&#xD;
      at risk and, potentially, prevention of cognitive decline has been gaining attraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous research reported a model of a combination single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)&#xD;
      (rs3777215, rs234434, rs71352238, and rs4420638) can predict AD onset with high performance,&#xD;
      which is useful to identify people at risk for AD and thus allows for timely treatment and&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both aerobic exercise and cognitive training have been demonstrated beneficial effects on&#xD;
      cognition in subjects with AD and healthy populations. Moreover, the synergistic effects of&#xD;
      the combination have been proven recently. However, the effect of combined aerobic exercise&#xD;
      and cognitive training on seniors with genetic susceptibility for AD remains to be&#xD;
      elucidated. Herein, this study aims to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. assess the effects of long-term combined aerobic exercise and cognitive training on&#xD;
           cognitive function, daily function, psychosocial status, and neural plasticity in&#xD;
           seniors with single nucleotide polymorphism of rs3777215, rs234434, rs71352238, and&#xD;
           rs4420638.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. confirm the predictive value of the SNP model for AD in a longitudinal setting.&#xD;
