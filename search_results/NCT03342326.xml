  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While verbal memory is quickly reached in the wake of Alzheimer's disease, the musical memory&#xD;
      remains preserved until a late stage of the disease. This observation encouraged the&#xD;
      development of music-based therapies in the management of neurocognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      disorders that characterize Alzheimer's disease. In order to develop rehabilitation programs&#xD;
      that effectively target cognitive functions to stimulate, it is necessary to understand the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying this beneficial effect of music on cognition.&#xD;

      The investigators study the stimulation by the song, material integrating language and music,&#xD;
      and having an autobiographical value. The investigators measure the lexical priming capacity&#xD;
      of the song, that is, its ability to activate and maintain lexical and semantic&#xD;
      representations, which are threatened with alteration in the course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This lexical priming effect by song is measured in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers during a single test session. In the first phase of the session,&#xD;
      participants are exposed to familiar songs, presented in sung, spoken or instrumental form,&#xD;
      whose popularity they evaluate. In the second phase, they perform two implicit memory tasks:&#xD;
      a trigram completion task and a lexical decision task. These tests measure the facilitation&#xD;
      of the processing of words evoked by songs in relation to words unrelated to songs,&#xD;
      reflecting a &quot;long-term&quot; memory update of mnemic traces of primed words.&#xD;
