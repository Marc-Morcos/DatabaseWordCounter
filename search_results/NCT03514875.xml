  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurodegenerative diseases such as Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's, and dementia&#xD;
      affect millions of Americans. Although these diseases are heavily researched, there is very&#xD;
      little research examining the impact of attenuated carotid artery endothelial function and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular blood flow on cognitive function. This is surprising, as cerebrovascular&#xD;
      oxygenation has been shown to be strongly associated with reduced cognitive function and the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, hypertension, diabetes, and high&#xD;
      cholesterol have been shown to increase the risk of Alzheimers related dementia. Therefore,&#xD;
      the purpose of this proposed study will be to examine the effects of MitoQ supplementation on&#xD;
      carotid artery vasodilatory function and cerebrovascular blood flow in those suffering from&#xD;
      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). MitoQ is a mitochondria-targeting antioxidant that can&#xD;
      improve nitric oxide production in the blood vessel, which should improve endothelial&#xD;
      function, and thus cerebrovascular blood flow.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Metabolic disease parameters, such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension have been observed in&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The causes of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimers&#xD;
      are not completely understood. However, increasing amounts of evidence are pointing to&#xD;
      vascular dysfunction as a cause of this disease. Known as the vascular hypothesis, pathology&#xD;
      is suggested to begin with cerebral hypoperfusion through attenuated blood flow via clogged&#xD;
      carotid arteries. Hypoperfusion of cerebral cells means that they do not receive enough&#xD;
      oxygen to function optimally. This lack of oxygen is believed to lead to cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. It is hypothesized that these metabolic conditions can damage the endothelial&#xD;
      wall, leading to impaired vasodilation and blood flow. This damage occurs in the carotid&#xD;
      arteries, which would limit blood flow to the brain. This impaired blood flow also results&#xD;
      from higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which reduce the bioavailability of&#xD;
      nitric oxide (NO), an important vasodilator. Antioxidants, such as MitoQ, reduce these ROS&#xD;
      and thus increase the NO availability, which improves endothelial function. This study will&#xD;
      measure the use of the antioxidant MitoQ to reduce this endothelial dysfunction, thereby&#xD;
      improving blood flow in the carotid arteries. Blood vessel health can be measured by how much&#xD;
      bigger or smaller a vessel can become, because the ability of the vessel to change size is&#xD;
      very important to make sure that blood is delivered to the tissues of the body. This study is&#xD;
      being done to help us understand if endothelial dysfunction in Mild Cognitive Impairment&#xD;
      (MCI) patients leads to the pathogenesis of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will examine how endothelial function and cerebrovascular blood flow changes after&#xD;
      consumption of MitoQ. We hope to achieve this through measures of carotid artery blood flow&#xD;
      and brachial artery blood flow, using a doppler ultrasound for both, while using flow&#xD;
      mediated dilation when measuring the brachial artery. The flow-mediated dilation test is a&#xD;
      validated and safe assessment of endothelial function and vascular health. The premise behind&#xD;
      the assessment is that endothelium produces autocoids, like nitric oxide, that dilate in&#xD;
      response to shear stress. Flow-mediated dilation has been shown to be an effective tool to&#xD;
      assess endothelial function in the peripheral and coronary vasculature. This assessment of&#xD;
      endothelial health can be used in healthy individuals to detect risk for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. We will also utilize near infrared spectroscopy to measure tissue oxygenation in the&#xD;
      brain, which is also a measure of improved blood flow, and will measure brain neural activity&#xD;
      with an EEG. Finally, we will collect blood samples to measure the change in ROS levels&#xD;
      before and after MitoQ consumption&#xD;
