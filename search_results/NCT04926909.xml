  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Number of people suffered from Parkinson disease (PD) is increasing every year. PET imaging&#xD;
      of dopamine transport receptors（DAT） serves as the gold standard for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      monitoring of PD development. However, due to high costs and radiation reasons, it is not&#xD;
      suitable for long-term follow-up. Serum cystatin C can be easily obtained and cheap as an&#xD;
      indicator. In recent years, studies have gradually found that it is related to the&#xD;
      progression of H&amp;Y staging of Parkinson's disease. To this extent, we want to further explore&#xD;
      whether it can reflect the loss of DAT in the brain. Explore whether it can partially replace&#xD;
      the role of DAT imaging for future clinical evaluation.&#xD;

        Pearson correlation analysis is planned, and the sample size is calculated with PASS 15.0&#xD;
        software. 121 participants required after sample size calculation. The calculation&#xD;
        parameters are as follows: Power = 0.90, α=0.05, ρ0 = 0.0, and ρ1 = 0.3.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients aged between 20 and 80 years and whose laboratory results included the levels&#xD;
             of serum Cystatin C within a month from the PET-DAT were recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To make the study cohort more homogeneous, PD patients with either a long-standing&#xD;
             duration (≥5 years) or advanced Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) staging (≥3) were excluded.&#xD;
