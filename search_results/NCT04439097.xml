  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, parallel-group, single blinded controlled clinical trial. The&#xD;
      general objective of this multicomponent physical exercise program (MPEP) associated with a&#xD;
      Mediterranean Diet (MeDi) is to decrease the risk of falls and fractures through the&#xD;
      improvement of the bone health and physical functions of people with Alzheimer Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocated to the intervention group will perform a MPEP with a MeDi during 6 months,&#xD;
      with a frequency of 3 sessions per week, and approximately 45-50 minutes of duration each&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, 4 evaluations will be carried out to assess the effects of the&#xD;
      interventions on bone mineral density, gait, balance, and fall risk: ((1) Baseline&#xD;
      (pre-intervention); 2) 1st post-intervention after 1 month; 3) 2nd post-intervention after 3&#xD;
      months; 4) Final, 3rd post-intervention after 6 months&#xD;

The cut-off point for normal mobility is 12 seconds and values &gt; 30 s indicate a high level of dependence. (a time &lt;10s it is considered normal; &lt;20s mobility difficulties and low or moderate risk of falls; &gt; 20 mobility problems with need of help and high risk of falls)</description>

    <description>Bone health status will be assessed by ultrasound calcaneus densitometry/sonometry. As secondary outcomes we will assess the Quantitative ultrasound index. To improve precision we will calculate de QUI, a variable derived from the mathematical combination of both SoS and BUA [0.41 Ã— (BUA + SoS) - 571] (19), expressed as percent.</description>
