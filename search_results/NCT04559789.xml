    <textblock>
      The Digital Cognitive Multi-domain Alzheimer's Risk Velocity (DC MARVEL) study is a 2-year&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial on dementia prevention. The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the effect of a digital cognitive health program on dementia risk, cognitive function, and&#xD;
      general health outcomes in middle age to older adults compared to a control group that&#xD;
      receives health education.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is expected to affect 131 million people worldwide by 2050, but as&#xD;
      many as 40% of these cases may be prevented by targeting modifiable risk factors such as&#xD;
      diet, physical activity, cognitive engagement, and smoking. Neurotrack Technologies, Inc.&#xD;
      will test the efficacy of a digital multi-domain lifestyle intervention with health coaching&#xD;
      for cognitive health designed to change behaviors associated with increased risk for AD. This&#xD;
      digital intervention addresses the challenge of scaling effective multi-domain lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions for cognitive health and has the potential to improve risk behaviors, thereby&#xD;
      reducing and/or delaying cognitive decline in older adults at risk for AD.&#xD;
