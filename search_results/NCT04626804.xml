  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Test the usability, perceptions and acceptability of a computer monitor for participant&#xD;
      diagnosed with ADRD and their caregiver who will program the applications specifically for&#xD;
      each individual to help them remember activities of daily living. Goal is to keep&#xD;
      participants in their homes longer and delay the need for institutional care&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyads will use the R/S unit for 90 days, unless they request it to be removed prior to the&#xD;
      end of the study. The research team (N. Fowler, PhD) will assess measures at baseline, 30&#xD;
      days, 60 days and 90 days. The primary outcome is a caregiver-assessed measure usability.&#xD;
      Secondary measures include patient- assessed usability, and objective measures of frequency&#xD;
      and type of use and computer literacy for both caregiver and the individual with ADRD22.&#xD;
      Methods to collect user data (frequency, clicks, etc.) will be collected using tools&#xD;
      developed in Aim 2. Desired outcome measures include (1) a mean score of &gt;80 (&quot;Good&quot;) on the&#xD;
      ten-item System Usability Scale (SUS) modified by IU investigators to accommodate older&#xD;
      adults23; (2) a 80 percent acceptability rate on the Behavioral Intention 3-item scale; and,&#xD;
      (3) at least 70 percent of participants using R/S a minimum of weekly. SUS is a validated&#xD;
      ten-item scale (e.g., &quot;Learning to use RememberStuff速 was quick for me&quot;) using a five-point&#xD;
      response scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Acceptance will be assessed as the mean&#xD;
      score on a 3-item Satisfaction scale (e.g., &quot;Rate your satisfied with RememberStuff速?&quot;). This&#xD;
      scale was adapted by IU Investigators for health IT and uses a seven-point response scale&#xD;
      from 0 (not at all) to 6 (a great deal). Satisfaction is one of the canonical assessments for&#xD;
      user acceptance of technology. SUS and Satisfaction questionnaires will be&#xD;
      researcher-administered by study staff either face-to-face in the participant's homes, or via&#xD;
      telephone. The mean and standard deviation for the composite SUS, acceptability rate and&#xD;
      weekly usage will be calculated to a 90% confidence interval. Other secondary measures are&#xD;
      adapted from Holden et al and are guided by the UTAUT221. Mean caregiver scores on the&#xD;
      measures will also be compared to mean scores of the patient measures to examine congruence&#xD;
      in usability and acceptability within the dyad.&#xD;
