    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop, evaluate, and commercialize an in-home supportive technology that&#xD;
      is designed to alleviate anxiety, burden, and loneliness in spousal and familial caregivers&#xD;
      of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or mild cognitive impairment in&#xD;
      rural homes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop, refine, evaluate, and commercialize a hardware/software system&#xD;
      designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, Internet-of-Things technologies (i.e.,&#xD;
      devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet), and social networking&#xD;
      to create a more safe and supportive home environment for caregivers and people who have&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or mild cognitive impairment. The system monitors&#xD;
      troublesome behaviors in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (e.g., wandering),&#xD;
      and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in&#xD;
      people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment with adverse caregiver outcomes (declines&#xD;
      in health and well-being). The system is designed to minimize demands on caregivers' limited&#xD;
      time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers&#xD;
      and care professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rural caregivers in the active treatment condition will have better health and&#xD;
           well-being (i.e., less caregiver depression, anxiety, loneliness, and burden) and higher&#xD;
           user satisfaction compared to those in the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The magnitude of the difference in health and well-being and user satisfaction for rural&#xD;
           caregivers in the active treatment condition compared to those in the control condition&#xD;
           will increase over time (reflecting additional bot learning and ability to adjust to&#xD;
           changing caregiver needs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In the active treatment condition, greater utilization of features (e.g., selecting and&#xD;
           receiving warnings, obtaining daily reports, accessing social support services) will be&#xD;
           associated with better caregiver health and well-being and higher user satisfaction.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants are randomly assigned to treatment arms by People Power. Identical systems are self-installed by caregivers in all homes regardless of treatment arm. Initiating the features of the system appropriate to the assigned treatment arm is done remotely by a member of the People Power staff following the installation. All participants complete the same questionnaires at the same intervals.</masking_description>
