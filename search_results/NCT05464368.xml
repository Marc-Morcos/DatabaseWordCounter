  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study to compare three new generation TAU radioligands, 18F-RO948&#xD;
      (formerly known as 18F-6958948), 18F-MK6240, and [18F]GTP1for imaging of taupathy and&#xD;
      demonstrate their absence of off-target binding in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and&#xD;
      older healthy controls (OC). The study will directly compare AD and OC with these three&#xD;
      next-generation TAU radioligands and compare each of them with historical data of the current&#xD;
      most widely used first generation radioligand, 18F-AV1451. Upto38 (30 AD (Amyloid +)and 8 OC&#xD;
      (Amyloid -), matched for age and sex with A+ subjects) male and female subjects aged 50-100&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study protocol: up to 8 for Cohort 1, up to 8 for Cohort 2, and up&#xD;
      to 22 for Cohort 3. The study consists of three cohorts: Cohort 1: Up to8 AD subjects (A+;&#xD;
      CDR 0.5 and 1)will receive two PET scans in random order, with receiving either18F-RO948&#xD;
      or18F-MK6240 at the first scan. A third scan with 18F-GTP1is possible, depending on timing&#xD;
      and radiotracer availability Cohort 2:Up to8 OC (A-; CDR=0)subjects will receive two PET&#xD;
      scans in random order, with receiving either18F-RO948or 18F-MK6240 at the first scan. A third&#xD;
      scan with 18F-GTP1is possible, depending on timing and radiotracer availability Cohort 3:Up&#xD;
      to 22 (A+; CDR = 0, .5 and 1) subjects will receive three PET scans in random order, with&#xD;
      receiving 18F-RO94818F-MK6240 or18F-GTP1at the first scan. Efforts will be made to include&#xD;
      about 1/3 CDR = 0, 1/3 CDR .5, and 1/3 CDR 1 in Cohort 3.&#xD;

    <description>Johns Hopkins University has conducted the first in human study in collaboration with Roche for 18F-RO948and found that 18F-RO948isa promising radioligand for imaging tau pathology in AD, showing excellent brain uptake and displaying little off-target binding(22, 17, 34).The injected activity for18F-RO948will be as low as practicable, while still allowing accurate quantification of the PET images.The injected dose of 370MBq(10mCi)has been selected based on the radiation dose estimates for18F-RO948gathered in human subjects provided by Michael Stabin, Ph.D., and in accordance with the principle that radiation doses should be &quot;as low as reasonably achievable&quot;.&#xD;
This radiotracer will be manufactured on site in the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology Cyclotron Facility, a certified Nuclear Pharmacy.</description>
