    <textblock>
      The Clinical trial is a pilot study for treatment of Alzheimer dementia by traditional&#xD;
      Chinese herbal medicine(TCM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative syndrome, characterized by an abroad&#xD;
      category of non-reversible impairment in cerebral function, making a long-term and gradually&#xD;
      decrease in the ability to mental cognitive tasks and performance of daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization says that 47.5 million people around the world are living with&#xD;
      dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is&#xD;
      often getting worse with time, affecting memory, language, and thought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the record from Ministry of Health and welfare in Taiwan. The population over 65&#xD;
      year-old is more than 3.36 million. It is estimated that there are more than 250,000 people&#xD;
      with mental disabilities, and nearly 600,000 people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease is accounting for 60-70%, the most common type of dementia. With the&#xD;
      aging of population, experts predict that the number of patients suffering from Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease will be up to 800,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, a study based on the health insurance database in Taiwan showed that 78.2% of&#xD;
      patients will take Chinese medical treatment, such as herbal medicine, acupuncture or&#xD;
      traumatology medical therapy like massage after diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease during&#xD;
      1997-2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial is a pilot study. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of traditional Chinese herbal medicine(TCM) of Alzheimer's dementia. The&#xD;
      participants diagnosed as Alzheimer's dementia will be given Traditional Chinese herbal&#xD;
      medicine powder, each pack included of Jia Wei Xiao Yao San granule(5 gm), Gou Teng granule&#xD;
      (1.1 gm),and Ba Ji Tian (1.1 gm), 2 times per day for 12 weeks. The participants will be&#xD;
      assessed by the MMSE, IADL, NPI-Q, GDS, QOL-AD, CCMQ, which will be conducted at baseline,&#xD;
      0weeks, 12weeks, and follow-up (16 weeks). To see if the traditional Chinese herbal medicine&#xD;
      can improve the symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia or its related symptoms.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes of Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, 12, 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ) consists of 60 items to classify a person into one or more of nine Body constitution(BC) types: gentleness (8 Items), Qi-deficiency (8 Items), Yang-deficiency (7 Items), Yin-deficiency (8 Items), phlegm-wetness (8 Items), wetness-heat (6 Items), blood-stasis (7 Items), Qi-depression (7 Items), and special diathesis (7 Items). Coexistence of multiple imbalanced BC types was possible which is consistent with the TCM theories. The scoring algorithm proposed in the original CCMQ was adopted in this study. A higher score in the CCMQ BC scale indicates a higher likelihood of the specific BC type, and a score of 30 is set as threshold for case definition. The CCMQ will be conducted at baseline, 12 weeks, and follow-up (16 weeks).</description>
