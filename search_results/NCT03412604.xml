      tACS stimulation sessions based on individual PET and MRI information in patients with&#xD;
      amyloid-positive PET with the hope that this leads to microglia activation and decrease in&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will leverage all this accumulated knowledge by implementing an intervention based&#xD;
      on multiple, individualized multifocal tACS stimulation sessions based on individual PET and&#xD;
      MRI information in patients with amyloid-positive PET with the hope that this leads to&#xD;
      microglia activation and decrease in cerebral amyloid and tau depositions in human patients&#xD;
      with AD.This would have immense translational impact, as gamma tACS is an intervention that&#xD;
      is portable, does not require expensive hardware, can be widely applied to large numbers of&#xD;
      patients with AD, as well as, given its favorable side effect profile, even to patients at&#xD;
      earlier stages of the disease who have cerebral amyloid/tau without clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to enroll 10 individuals with AD with evidence of increased cerebral&#xD;
      amyloid burden on amyloid PET imaging. This would allow for a final sample size of 5-6 fully&#xD;
      evaluable subjects. Each subject's participation in this study will consist of approximately&#xD;
      31-35 visits: 1 day for consent and screening procedures, 5-7 days of baseline procedures&#xD;
      (this includes the PET scans), 20 tACS study visits, and 5-7 days of follow-up assessments.&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo baseline cognitive assessment, structural and functional MRI&#xD;
      characterization, PET imaging to assess amyloid burden, tau deposition and level of microglia&#xD;
      activation, and resting-state EEG measurement. Additionally, subjects will undergo a TMS-EEG&#xD;
      and a tACS-EEG recording session to assess brain plasticity levels and identify markers of&#xD;
      response to stimulation. All subjects will subsequently undergo 20 sessions of&#xD;
      gamma-frequency (40 Hz) tACS. At the end of the 20 sessions, subjects will then repeat the&#xD;
      baseline assessments over 5-7 visits, including repeat PET imaging to assess for changes in&#xD;
      amyloid burden, tau deposition, and microglia activation.&#xD;

    <measure>PET Amyloid Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the amyloid load observed via PET imaging will be evaluated by comparing PET data acquired before and after the 20 tACS sessions. The metric used is standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), a measure of the amount of proteins in the brain identified at the PET exam. We will calculate the difference between pre and post tACS SUVR for the entire brain and report the average value (and standard deviation) for the entire group of patients. A negative value express a decrease in the amount of proteins in the brain post tACS intervention.</description>

    <description>Changes in the tau deposition observed via PET imaging will be evaluated by comparing PET data acquired before and after the 20 tACS sessions. The metric used is SUVR, a measure of the amount of proteins in the brain identified at the PET exam. We will calculate the difference between pre and post tACS SUVR (dSUVR) for the entire brain and report the average value (and standard deviation) for the entire group of patients. A negative value express a decrease in the amount of proteins in the brain post tACS intervention.</description>

    <measure>PET Microglia Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the microglia activation observed via PET imaging will be evaluated by comparing PET data acquired before and after the 20 tACS sessions. The metric used is SUVR, a measure of the amount of proteins in the brain identified at the PET exam. We will calculate the difference between pre and post tACS SUVR (dSUVR) for the entire brain and report the average value (and standard deviation) for the entire group of patients.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Brain Perfusion as Measured by Arterial Spin Labeling</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks (pre-post tACS intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients underwent a comprehensive MRI exam before and after the tACS intervention, including measures of brain perfusion via Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) sequences. The outcome measure represent the average change in perfusion (i.e. blood flow) recorded in regions targeted by tACS. Since Alzheimer's Disease is also characterized by a decrease of brain metabolism, an increased of blood flow after treatment would constitute a very promising sign of tACS efficacy in reducing Alzheimer's pathology in the brain.&#xD;
We will report the change in blood flow (mean, standard deviation) after tACS treatment.</description>

    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale -Cog Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Adas-Cog score will be reported, to document a potential clinical benefit of tACS. The scale ranges from 0-70 with higher score indicating greater cognitive impairment.</description>

The assessment of the effect of stimulation on microglia activation, amyloid deposition and tau deposition will constitute a primary outcome measure.

        <description>Changes in the amyloid load observed via PET imaging will be evaluated by comparing PET data acquired before and after the 20 tACS sessions. The metric used is standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), a measure of the amount of proteins in the brain identified at the PET exam. We will calculate the difference between pre and post tACS SUVR for the entire brain and report the average value (and standard deviation) for the entire group of patients. A negative value express a decrease in the amount of proteins in the brain post tACS intervention.</description>

        <description>Patients underwent a comprehensive MRI exam before and after the tACS intervention, including measures of brain perfusion via Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) sequences. The outcome measure represent the average change in perfusion (i.e. blood flow) recorded in regions targeted by tACS. Since Alzheimer's Disease is also characterized by a decrease of brain metabolism, an increased of blood flow after treatment would constitute a very promising sign of tACS efficacy in reducing Alzheimer's pathology in the brain.&#xD;

          <description>Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) tuned at the frequency of 40Hz (gamma frequency) will be applied for 1 hour in 20 sessions on consecutive weekdays. The tACS intervention (20 sessions) will be preceded and followed by amyloid, microglia and tau PET imaging as well as a clinical/cognitive evaluation. The assessment of the effect of stimulation on microglia activation, amyloid deposition and tau deposition will constitute a primary outcome measure. Assessment of adverse effects will be also evaluated as a secondary outcome. The effect of brain stimulation on brain connectivity will be assessed by EEG and MRI and cognitive function.&#xD;
Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS): tACS will be applied at a frequency of 40Hz and targeting the area of maximal tracer uptake on amyloid PET imaging using an individualized multielectrode design to maximize the induced electrical current to the target region.</description>
