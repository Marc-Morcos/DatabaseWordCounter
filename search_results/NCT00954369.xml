      PHASE: Phase 0, Exploratory Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: To collect drug safety, bio-distribution and dosimetry data, to begin collection&#xD;
      of PET/CT imaging data, to acquire experience to improve study design and the conduct of&#xD;
      future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Exploratory, open label, non-randomized, multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION: Three visits - one screening, one imaging, and one follow-up visit at 24 hours&#xD;
      post-dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES: Informed consent, collection of demographic information and medical history,&#xD;
      administration of mental status exam, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs,&#xD;
      routine blood tests to assess major organ functions, complete blood counts and clinical&#xD;
      chemistries for safety, dosing with [F-18]W372, PET imaging scans of brain (in sixteen&#xD;
      subjects), whole body PET imaging and urine collections for dosimetry evaluation (in four&#xD;
      subjects only), observation and interviews following imaging to collect adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS: Twenty (20) subjects ≥ 55 years old:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will consist of 10 subjects who have a low probability of being currently positive&#xD;
      for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as defined by the protocol criteria (MMSE ≥ 28). Four of the 10&#xD;
      subjects will undergo whole body PET imaging for dosimetry evaluations, and 6 of the 10&#xD;
      subjects will undergo PET imaging of the brain only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will consist of 10 subjects who have a high probability of currently being positive&#xD;
      for AD as defined by the protocol criteria (MMSE &lt; 24); these 10 subjects will undergo PET&#xD;
      imaging of the brain only.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      [F-18]W372 is being developed as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging of the&#xD;
      human brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMI is seeking to determine if [F-18]W372 might be useful as a noninvasive assessment tool in&#xD;
      aid of clinical evaluations of subjects with conditions associated with increased amyloid-β&#xD;
      deposits, such as Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to the other non-invasive imaging approach, the values of amyloid PET imaging are&#xD;
      more sensitive and accurate than previously established measures by FDG PET or volumetric MRI&#xD;
      for diagnostic classification of subjects, suggesting that amyloid PET ligands may be more&#xD;
      useful in differentiating among Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal&#xD;
      aging as well as other neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this novel kind of molecular&#xD;
      markers may provide advantages to measure amyloid plaques in vivo, have the potential to&#xD;
      revolutionize early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and hopefully will facilitate the AD&#xD;
      diagnosis with improved accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this exploratory study, the novel PET ligand for imaging amyloid plaques will be evaluated&#xD;
      in age-matched normals with low probability being AD and subjects with high probability being&#xD;
      AD in order to determine the bio-distribution, visualize signal/background in brains, and&#xD;
      ultimately evaluate the safety and feasibility of [F-18] W372 as a potential PET biomarker&#xD;
      for imaging amyloids in human brains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IP presents no known risks from either in vitro study in cell lines or in vivo study in&#xD;
      animals according to preclinical investigations of this compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population to be studied consists of a total of approximately twenty adult subjects,&#xD;
      which will be a two group assignment. Group one will consist of ten subjects who have a low&#xD;
      probability of being currently positive for Alzheimer's disease (AD) as defined by the&#xD;
      protocol criteria. Four of the ten subjects in Group one will undergo evaluations for&#xD;
      dosimetry. Group two will consist of ten subjects who have a high probability of currently&#xD;
      being positive for AD as defined by the protocol criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first year, this exploratory trial will be conducted as a Phase 0 study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate bio-distribution data, to collect baseline imaging data, and to gather preliminary&#xD;
      safety data for this investigational product. Based on the analyzed study results, this&#xD;
      information will be considered in the design of future clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this exploratory study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect drug safety information, bio-distribution data, and radiation dosimetry&#xD;
           estimation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the drug uptake and signal/background information in brain PET imaging for&#xD;
           subjects having a high probability of being currently positive for AD and age-matched&#xD;
           subject having a low probability of being currently positive for AD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To use this exploratory Investigational New Drug (eIND) document in order to obtain the&#xD;
           necessary information to file an IND (Investigational New Drug) application with the FDA&#xD;
           (Food and Drug Administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective for this exploratory study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To begin collection of baseline PET imaging data and to gain information to improve the&#xD;
      study design for the conduct of future trials&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is expected to begin subject enrollment in approximately August 2009 and end&#xD;
      subject participation in approximately December 2009, depending on the rate of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject is expected to attend several visits, adding up to several hours (about 10 hours)&#xD;
      of participation over three visits: a screening visit (Visit 1 - about 2 hours), a PET/CT&#xD;
      imaging visit (Visit 2 - about 3-4 hours), and a follow up visit (Visit 3 - about 1 hour)&#xD;
      about 24 hours after receiving the investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational product will be administered to each qualified subject via a bolus&#xD;
      injection (approximately 10 mCi will be administered for all subjects, except 20 mCi for the&#xD;
      four subjects with a low probability of being positive for AD that are involved in the&#xD;
      dosimetry analysis). This dose will not exceed 20 mCi, as the imaging time will extend out to&#xD;
      approximately three hours. A larger dose (20 mCi) is needed in order to obtain quality images&#xD;
      at the later time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study subject study subject will undergo three (3) visits. Visit 1 will be an initial&#xD;
      screening visit to obtain informed consent and to determine if the prospective subject meets&#xD;
      inclusion / exclusion criteria by having eligibility blood labs drawn and assessing mental&#xD;
      status by performing the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE). Concomitant medications and adverse&#xD;
      events are recorded from the time of informed consent through Visit 3. Visit 2 will be an&#xD;
      imaging visit in which a physical exam is performed, vital signs are measured, ECG testing is&#xD;
      done, and pre-dose blood labs are drawn for safety. The subject then receives one dose of&#xD;
      investigational product and undergoes PET imaging. The subject will undergo additional vital&#xD;
      sign measurements and ECG testing after dosing during Visit 2. Visit 3 will be done to repeat&#xD;
      the drawing of blood labs for safety, measure vital signs, ECG testing is done. All three&#xD;
      visits must be completed in order to complete participation in the study.&#xD;
