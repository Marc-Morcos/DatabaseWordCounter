    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of ramelteon, once daily (QD), in&#xD;
      subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease and sleep disturbance&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological data for 2005 show that an estimated 4.2 million people in the US suffer from&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease, often necessitating caregiver assistance, which can in many cases&#xD;
      progress to institutionalization. Subjects with Alzheimer's disease dementia frequently&#xD;
      experience disturbed sleep patterns characterized by insufficient nocturnal sleep and&#xD;
      excessive daytime napping, which has been associated with both cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      pathology such as impaired daytime functioning, agitation, and nocturnal wandering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the causality of sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's disease remains unclear; some&#xD;
      research suggests that the fragmented sleep and associated behavioral disturbances could be&#xD;
      related to the degeneration of the serotonergic and noradrenergic innervation of&#xD;
      suprachiasmatic nucleus andsubsequent disruption in melatonin secretion patterns.&#xD;
      Additionally, research suggests that melatonin levels are decreased in patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States, ramelteon is marketed for the treatment of insomnia characterized by&#xD;
      difficulty with sleep onset and is under global development for the treatment of transient,&#xD;
      chronic insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. It is believed that ramelteon works by&#xD;
      binding melatonin to MT1/MT2 receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus which inhibits firing&#xD;
      of specific neurons, which is thought to attenuate the alerting signal and allows the&#xD;
      homeostatic mechanism to express itself and promote sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation is anticipated to be about 11 weeks (approximately 3 months).&#xD;
