  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The steroid pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS) may be one of the factors responsible for the memory&#xD;
      decline related to normal aging or associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine whether plasma levels of PREGS are decreased patients with at mild&#xD;
      to moderate AD compared with AD-free control subjects matched for gender and age and to see&#xD;
      whether they are inversely correlated with the severity of memory deficits in AD patients.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that blood levels of PREGS are decreased with advanced age and with the&#xD;
      stage of AD that would be positively correlated with memory deficits. Therefore PREGS could&#xD;
      be considered as an early marker of the memory deficits in AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PREGS is a derivative of pregnenolone which the obligatory precursor of all steroid hormones&#xD;
      originating from the gonads and adrenal glands. In rodents, PREGS has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      improve memory performance in various behavioural tests. In humans, PREGS is one the most&#xD;
      abundant circulating steroids. There are some indications about its decrease in blood during&#xD;
      aging, and in brain samples from aged patients with AD, low concentrations of PREGS have been&#xD;
      correlated with high levels of beta-amyloid peptide and phosphorylated tau protein. To date,&#xD;
      a precise and rigorous evaluation of PREGS blood concentrations during aging is lacking and&#xD;
      the relationship between these concentrations and the memory loss associated with AD has not&#xD;
      been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To show that plasma concentrations of PREGS are decreased in AD patients (&quot;&#xD;
      case &quot;) compared to free-AD subjects (&quot; controls &quot;), matched for gender and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To show that plasma concentrations of PREGS are inversely correlated with the severity&#xD;
           of memory deficits in AD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To show that plasma concentrations of PREGS are correlated with the memory scores in the&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To show that plasma concentrations of PREGS decrease in the controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To search for a relationship between some of PREGS metabolites and age or the severity&#xD;
           of memory deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a case-control study that will comprise 200 subjects aged over 70 years, including&#xD;
      100 outpatients with mild to moderate AD and 100 AD-free volunteer controls matched on age&#xD;
      and gender. These two groups will be stratified into age-sub-groups [70-74] [75-79] [80-84]&#xD;
      [85-89] &gt; 90 years and will include 10 men and 10 women per sub-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AD patients and controls will be enrolled and evaluated in the geriatric centres of 5&#xD;
      hospitals namely BICETRE, BROCA, PAUL BROUSSE, PITIE-SALPETRIERE and ROTHSCHILD. They will&#xD;
      all be submitted to a clinical examination, biological analyses, cognitive tests and a brain&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging scan. Blood will be collected from all subjects for steroid&#xD;
      analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, a sensitive and accurate methodology that&#xD;
      allows simultaneous quantification of several steroids in the same individual sample. PREGS&#xD;
      and some of its metabolites will be identified and quantified at the &quot;Institute medical of&#xD;
      heath&quot; (INSERM U788).&#xD;
