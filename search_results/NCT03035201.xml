    <textblock>
      The parent trial (COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study, COSMOS; NCT02422745) is a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial of cocoa extract supplement (containing a total of 500 mg/d&#xD;
      flavanols, including 80 mg. (-)-epicatechins), and a standard multivitamin supplement to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer among men aged 60 years and older and&#xD;
      women aged 65 years and older. A cognitive ancillary study (COSMOS-Mind) is being conducted&#xD;
      among men and women, 65 years and older, who are enrolled in COSMOS and will examine whether&#xD;
      the cocoa extract supplement or the multivitamin supplement improves cognitive function and&#xD;
      reduces risk of cognitive impairment, including AD and other related types of dementia.&#xD;
      Participants at the Wake Forest site will only be getting a phone call.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Identifying a safe, affordable, and well-tolerated intervention that prevents cognitive&#xD;
      decline in older adults is of critical public health importance. There is compelling evidence&#xD;
      from basic science, and small clinical studies that cocoa flavanols may protect cognitive&#xD;
      function in older adults and reduce risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia.&#xD;
      Thus, this intervention could have important downstream benefits for health care utilization&#xD;
      and cost, caregiver burden, and overall quality of life for older adults. Cocoa flavanol&#xD;
      effects on cognition, however, need to be assessed in a definitive clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parent trial (COSMOS) will enroll 21,442 women and men nationwide, drawn from the Women's&#xD;
      Health Initiative (WHI) participant cohort and the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL)&#xD;
      non-randomized respondent cohort, and will be conducted primarily by mail to assess whether&#xD;
      high-potency cocoa flavanol extract and a multivitamin - alone or in combination - will&#xD;
      reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer over 3 years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the COSMOS trial began, an advanced method to analyze cocoa flavanols was accredited by&#xD;
      AOAC International as a First Action Official Method of Analysis&#xD;
      https://doi.org/10.1093/jaoacint/qsaa132 [secure-web.cisco.com]). This updated method relies&#xD;
      on a reference material (RM8403) recently standardized and made commercially available by the&#xD;
      U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. While the actual cocoa flavanol content&#xD;
      of the COSMOS intervention remained unchanged throughout the trial, the application of this&#xD;
      new analytical method led to expected changes in how the total cocoa flavanol content is now&#xD;
      reported. Applying AOAC 2020.05/RM8403 to the COSMOS intervention, the total cocoa flavanol&#xD;
      content of the COSMOS intervention is now 500 mg/day. Reporting of (-)-epicatechin content&#xD;
      remained unaffected. Going forward, this record will therefore apply AOAC 2020.05/RM8403 and&#xD;
      report that the COSMOS intervention tested 500 mg/day of cocoa flavanols, including 80 mg of&#xD;
      (-)-epicatechin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants are enrolled in COSMOS, the study team at Brigham and Women's Hospital will&#xD;
      provide contact information and other parent trial outcomes for COSMOS-Mind participants to&#xD;
      the Wake Forest team using a secure web-based data transfer system. This seamless exchange of&#xD;
      information between sites will permit timely accounting to ensure that the targeted&#xD;
      demographics for enrollment are achieved (e.g. gender, age, race, ethnicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COSMOS-Mind will only be administered a telephone cognitive assessment to all participants at&#xD;
      enrollment (baseline), and annually for 3 years of follow-up by trained and certified staff&#xD;
      of the Wake Forest COSMOS-Mind team.&#xD;
