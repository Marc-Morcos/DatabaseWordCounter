  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) imaging with a radioactive compound called [F-18]FDDNP in subjects&#xD;
      with suspected Alzheimer's disease or suspected chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) to&#xD;
      predict clinical decline after one and two years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll approximately 180 participants with mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (90 with suspected Alzheimer's Disease and 90 with suspected Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy&#xD;
      with a history of head trauma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to UCLA for 4 visits and will be called twice. The study duration is 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will first complete an over the phone screening to assess their eligibility. If&#xD;
      they pass the phone screen, then they will be invited to complete an in-person screen and&#xD;
      will sign the informed consent form. They will then undergo a neurological evaluation, blood&#xD;
      draw, and neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within a month of the screening visit, participants will complete the imaging visit.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, if eligible, and a PET&#xD;
      scan with FDDNP. For participants who are unable to undergo an MRI due to contraindications,&#xD;
      they will complete a CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for possible adverse events following the procedures and will&#xD;
      be called 24 hours later and 2 weeks later to assess for any potential adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the one and two-year follow-up visits, participants' medical history will be reviewed. At&#xD;
      this time, they will also complete a neuropsychiatric evaluation, blood draw and&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of clinical and cognitive decline from [F-18] FDDNP PET scan readers (blinded to&#xD;
      clinical evaluations) and clinicians (blinded to [F-18]FDDNP PET scan results) will be&#xD;
      compared with actual clinical outcomes determined at one and two-year follow-up visits.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Box Scores (CDR-SB)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>We propose to use the CDR Sum of Box Scores (CDR-SB) as the primary efficacy endpoint to be predicted (at two-year follow-up) following baseline when the [F-18]FDDNP-PET imaging is performed. The CDR-SB score is obtained by summing each of the domain box scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 18. We will use change in CDR-SB score as the common outcome variable. We will convert individual CDR-SB scores into standardized scores by subtracting the baseline mean and dividing by the baseline standard deviation of the study sample (Monsell et al, 2012). Individuals experiencing worsening of cognition by at least 0.5 standard deviation per year in the standardized CDR-SB score will be classified as cognitive decliners; others will be classified as cognitive maintainers.</description>

        Inclusion criteria for all participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants enrolling in the trial must meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant may be male or female and of any race/ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 to 80 years at the time of study drug dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants must be either surgically sterilized or post-menopausal, defined&#xD;
             as at least one-year without menses as reported by the participant or have a negative&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant or participant's legally acceptable representative (when appropriate)&#xD;
             provides informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is capable of complying with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is capable of communicating with study personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is willing to undergo longitudinal follow-up at 1 and 2 years after the&#xD;
             Imaging Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants will meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment (Petersen et al,&#xD;
             2014) or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (APA, 2013):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient awareness of a memory problem, preferably confirmed by another person who&#xD;
             knows the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Memory impairment detected with standard assessment tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to perform normal daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For a broad definition of mild cognitive impairment, we also use guidelines to&#xD;
             identify those with other mild cognitive impairment subtypes, including those with&#xD;
             memory impairment and/or additional cognitive deficits (Winblad et al, 2004). The&#xD;
             diagnosis will be corroborated by clinical judgment and include participants who score&#xD;
             1 standard deviation or more below the age-corrected norms because this threshold for&#xD;
             impairment yields high sensitivity for predicting dementia (de Jager et al, 2005). To&#xD;
             balance increased sensitivity with specificity, impairment on at least 2&#xD;
             neuropsychological tests will be required (Jak et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for participants with suspected CTE&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with suspected CTE enrolling in the trial must meet all of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Participant must meet the most recently proposed clinical criteria for suspected CTE&#xD;
        (termed possible traumatic encephalopathy syndrome or TES; Reams et al, 2016). These&#xD;
        proposed diagnostic criteria for possible TES include the following features:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Required Features:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistence of symptoms for longer than 2 years; no other neurologic disorder that is&#xD;
             more likely to account for all the clinical features; history of head trauma exposure;&#xD;
             progressive course; and at least 1 supportive feature&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of head trauma exposure, typically associated with history of concussion,&#xD;
             although may be limited to subconcussive trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Head trauma exposure is repetitive in nature&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrated progressive course&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Delayed symptom onset&#xD;

          -  Self-report or observer report of cognitive dysfunction, confirmed with objective&#xD;
             cognitive decline documented by results of formal neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
             Cognitive decline typically affects more than 1 domain (executive, visuospatial,&#xD;
             memory, and language).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Supportive Features (only 1 required):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Emotional dysregulation: including depression, anxiety, agitation, aggression,&#xD;
             paranoid ideation, deterioration of interpersonal relationships, and suicidality&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Behavioral change: including violence, poor impulse control, socially inappropriate&#xD;
             behavior, avolition, apathy, change in personality, and comorbid substance abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Motor disturbance: including bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, gait instability,&#xD;
             dysarthria, dysphagia, and ataxia&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for participants with suspected AD&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with suspected AD enrolling in the trial must meet all of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context of a delirium.&#xD;
