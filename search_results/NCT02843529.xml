    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to evaluate the performance of the ALTOIDA™ System as a tool&#xD;
      to assist physicians in diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in real-world clinical settings.&#xD;
      The design of this study is guided by two overriding factors: 1) to optimize the performance&#xD;
      of the ALTOIDA™ Neuro Motor Index (NMI) prognosis classifiers, the subjects making up the&#xD;
      training sets must be well characterized as to their clinical diagnosis, and 2) all ALTOIDA™&#xD;
      tests must be performed and reproduced in real-world clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is already a large body of peer-reviewed scientific literature demonstrating&#xD;
      that certain digital biomarker patterns are associated with certain neurologic conditions,&#xD;
      the utilization of such tools for the evaluation of neurologic disorders is still considered&#xD;
      an emerging science and therefore in the investigational stage. Although this protocol will&#xD;
      report on brain patterns of certain neurologic conditions such as cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease, based on patterns published in peer-reviewed journals, such findings are&#xD;
      not considered stand alone or diagnostic per se and should always be considered by the&#xD;
      primary physician in conjunction with the patient's clinical condition. These data should&#xD;
      only be used as additional information to add to the primary physician's diagnostic&#xD;
      impression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine relationships among the clinical, cognitive, imaging,&#xD;
      genetic, and biochemical biomarker characteristics of the stage of the AD spectrum that&#xD;
      precedes MCI, the mildest symptomatic phase of AD, referred to here as MCI. The ADNI-GO model&#xD;
      posits that AD begins with amyloid β (Aβ) deposition in the cortex, which leads to synaptic&#xD;
      dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and cognitive/ functional decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may be possible to determine the future development of ALZ in a preclinical state in a&#xD;
      cognitively normal but high risk individual at least 18-24 months before any symptoms develop&#xD;
      of cognitive impairment. In addition a newly proposed research framework proposes to use&#xD;
      biomarkers for amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (ATN) to classify MCI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the leading-edge technologies under study are brain-imaging techniques, such as&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET), including FDG-PET (which measures glucose metabolism in&#xD;
      the brain); PET using a radioactive compound (F-AV-45) that measures brain beta-amyloid; and&#xD;
      structural MRI. Brain scans are showing scientists how the brain's structure and function&#xD;
      change as AD starts and progresses. Biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid are revealing other&#xD;
      changes that could identify which patients with MCI will develop Alzheimer's. Scientists are&#xD;
      looking at levels of beta-amyloid and tau in cerebrospinal fluid. (Abnormal amounts of the&#xD;
      amyloid and tau proteins in the brain are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of the ALTOIDA™ System as as a tool to&#xD;
      assist physicians in diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in real-world clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Multi-Center Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      primary goal of this study will be to evaluate the ALTOIDA™ Platform across multiple study&#xD;
      locations. This will demonstrate an ability to perform tests, collect data, and generate&#xD;
      classifications irrespective of variations in testing locations and personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 international study sites will be selected with the US based sites being a recognized NIH&#xD;
      Center of Excellence for Alzheimer's disease or other nationally recognized Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease research center. Each site will evaluate up to 60 community dwellers evenly divided&#xD;
      between MCI patients and age-matched controls (while the prevalence of AD is approximately&#xD;
      12% in the general population, the ratio of AD to normal among those who visit a clinic for&#xD;
      memory or cognitive related issues is between 50-60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each site will follow the same testing protocols. Participants will be asked if they would&#xD;
      like to participate in a protocol that monitors their prospective risk for developing ALZ&#xD;
      short term, and whether certain of their prescribed medications may have a protective effect.&#xD;
      Those who are accepting to be participants are then enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollees will be tested for risk factors for having pre-clinical ALZ. Individuals identified&#xD;
      as being at risk at baseline are followed at 6 month intervals for a 48 month period using&#xD;
      psychometric testing and functional neuroimaging. Their maintenance of cognitive stability or&#xD;
      cognitive decline is monitored while under the care of their PMD and while taking medications&#xD;
      of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All test data will be uploaded to the online ALTOIDA™ database server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. The overall impact of this study will be increased knowledge concerning the sequence and&#xD;
      timing of events leading to MCI and from MCI to AD, development of better clinical and Neuro&#xD;
      Motor Index prognosis methods for early detection and for monitoring the progression of these&#xD;
      conditions, and facilitation of clinical trials of treatments to slow disease progression,&#xD;
      ultimately contributing to the prevention of AD.&#xD;
