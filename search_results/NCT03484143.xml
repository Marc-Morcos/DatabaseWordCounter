  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The active Neuro RX Gamma device uses non-invasive near-infrared energy delivered to the&#xD;
      brain with the intention to improve cognitive functioning and quality of life in patients&#xD;
      with moderate to severe Alzheimer's Disease. Treatment will occur at home-based treatment&#xD;
      sessions with the device.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A potential participant will undergo pre-screening and screening assessments to assess&#xD;
      eligibility for the study. Eligible participants will undergo a baseline visit in which they&#xD;
      will be randomized to either active or sham Neuro RX Gamma device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vielight Neuro RX Gamma is a non-invasive device that administers low-energy&#xD;
      near-infrared LED (light emitting diode) light to the brain transcranially and intranasally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two treatment phases in the trial, each with a duration of 12 weeks. The patient&#xD;
      along with the caregiver will perform home (or living facility) - based treatments with the&#xD;
      device and document the sessions in a patient diary. The device will be applied to the&#xD;
      patient participant by a dedicated caregiver for a 20 minute daily session, 6 days a week for&#xD;
      a total of 12 weeks. The study participant and caregiver will be required to return to the&#xD;
      clinic for follow-up assessments at 12 and 24 weeks post randomization, between treatment&#xD;
      phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      228 patients will be enrolled across 12 sites in Canada and the United States.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12 and Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcomes. It includes measures of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The EQ visual analogue scale (VAS) records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health as judged by the individual respondents.</description>

    <description>The QOL-AD is a series of questions designed to be administered to individuals with dementia, to obtain a rating of a patient's quality of life from both the patient and the caregiver. It includes assessments of the individual's relationship with friends and family, concerns about finances, physical condition, mood, and an overall assessment of life quality. There are 13 items with a score range from 13 to 52.</description>
