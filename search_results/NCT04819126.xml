      Purpose: This study was planned to investigate the effects of the Nintendo Wii virtual&#xD;
      reality application on muscle strength and fall risk in individuals with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The study included a total of 32 volunteers between the ages of 65-80, with mild or&#xD;
      moderate AD diagnosed. These individuals were divided into 2 groups as a training group and&#xD;
      control group. The training group was trained with games from different categories such as&#xD;
      balance and aerobic exercises with a Nintendo Wii virtual reality device 2 times a week for a&#xD;
      period of 6 weeks, with 1 session lasting for 30 minutes. Mini-Mental State Test, Knee&#xD;
      Extension Muscle Strength, Timed Up and Go Test, Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale results of&#xD;
      individuals were recorded in the evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>The study included a total of 32 volunteers between the ages of 65-80, who stayed in Karaman Ahmet Mete Nursing Home, Elderly Care and Rehabilitation Center, with mild or moderate Alzheimer's dementia diagnosed by a neurologist. As a result of the power analysis, it was calculated that at least 16 individuals could be included in each group (at least 32 individuals in total). Randomization was performed by the sealed-envelope method. According to this method, 4 females and 12 males were determined to be in the control group, while 5 females and 11 males were determined to be in the training group.&#xD;
The evaluation was completed before the intervention. The same evaluation was conducted after 6 weeks.&#xD;
The training group was trained with games from different categories such as balance and aerobic exercises with a Nintendo Wii virtual reality device 2 times a week for a period of 6 weeks, with 1 session lasting for 30 minutes, and each patient was trained with the same games.</description>

    <description>In the control group, no application was performed during this period, and routine medical treatments were continued. The training group was evaluated before and after the training, while the control group was re-evaluated at the end of the 6th week after the first evaluation. After the study was completed, the volunteers from the control group were also given training.</description>
