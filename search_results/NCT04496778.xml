    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking and behavior. Symptoms&#xD;
      eventually grow severe enough to interfere with daily tasks. this study aimed to delay the&#xD;
      deterioration of anemic elderly condition as memory affection interfere with daily life&#xD;
      activities and social interaction&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia and describes a clinical syndrome made&#xD;
      up of three domains. First, a neuro-psychological domain encompassing those deficits of&#xD;
      cognitive function such as amnesia (memory loss), aphasia (language disturbance), apraxia&#xD;
      (the inability to carry out motor tasks despite intact motor functions) and agnosia (the&#xD;
      inability to recognize people or objects despite intact sensory functions). Second, a group&#xD;
      of psychiatric symptoms and behavioral disturbances, which have been termed neuro-psychiatric&#xD;
      features, non-cognitive phenomena, or behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease is substantially increased among people aged 65 years or more, with a&#xD;
      progressive decline in memory, thinking, language and learning capacity. Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      should be differentiated from normal age-related decline in cognitive function, which is more&#xD;
      gradual and associated with less disability. Diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia have all been found to increase risk as well a history of brain trauma,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease, and vasculopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dementia affects approximately 5%-8% of individuals over age 65, 15%- 20% of individuals over&#xD;
      age 75, and 25%-50% of individuals over age 85. Alzheimer disease is the most common&#xD;
      dementia, accounting for 50%-75% of the total, with a greater proportion in the higher age&#xD;
      ranges Dementia is expensive. The financial costs of managing Alzheimer's disease are&#xD;
      enormous. The cost of illness is high in terms of both public and private resources. Families&#xD;
      and caregivers who are required to provide care and patients affected by dementia also pay a&#xD;
      high price in terms of their quality of life The primary goals of treatment are to maximize&#xD;
      the patient's ability to function in daily life, maintain quality of life, slow the&#xD;
      progression of symptoms, and treat depression or disruptive behaviors Low level laser therapy&#xD;
      is a safe, non-invasive, and non-thermal modality that is based on a strong body of research&#xD;
      dating back to the 1960.It involved in treating several conditions, the mechanisms of action&#xD;
      involve the stimulation of mitochondria by the absorption of photons in cytochrome c oxidase,&#xD;
      resulting in increased adenosine triphosphate production, reduced oxidative stress,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects, and increased focal cerebral blood flow&#xD;
