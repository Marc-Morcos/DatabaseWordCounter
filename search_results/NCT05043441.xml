  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The randomized controlled trial aims to assess effects of a coach-guided ten-week online&#xD;
      acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) intervention on distressed family caregivers of&#xD;
      people with dementia (PwD) compared to the control group. A total of 64 family caregivers of&#xD;
      PwD who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited and randomized to either the&#xD;
      intervention group or the control group. Exploratory hypotheses are that the ACT group will&#xD;
      show decreases in caregivers' psychological distress and burden and improvements in&#xD;
      psychological quality of life and engagement in meaningful activities at posttest and 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up, compared to the control group.&#xD;

      The randomized controlled trial aims to assess effects of a coach-guided online acceptance&#xD;
      and commitment therapy (ACT) intervention on distressed family caregivers of people with&#xD;
      dementia (PwD) compared to the control group. A total of 64 family caregivers of PwD who meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria will be recruited and randomized to either the intervention group or&#xD;
      the control group. Caregivers assigned to the intervention group will receive individual ACT&#xD;
      sessions guided by a trained coach for one hour per week over 10 weeks through Zoom&#xD;
      videoconferencing with supplemental psychoeducation materials provided. Caregivers assigned&#xD;
      to the control group will receive care as usual with psychoeducation materials provided&#xD;
      during the study period. Outcomes regarding caregivers' mental health will be collected at&#xD;
      three time points (i.e., pretest, posttest, and 3-month follow-up) and compared between&#xD;
      groups over time. Exploratory hypotheses are that the ACT group will show decreases in&#xD;
      caregivers' psychological distress and burden and improvements in psychological quality of&#xD;
      life and engagement in meaningful activities at posttest and 3-month follow-up, compared to&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;
