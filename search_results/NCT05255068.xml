  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The OPTIMAL is designed to teach staff to effectively engage residents in eating using&#xD;
      individualized, person-centered behavioral strategies. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      develop and refine OPTIMAL and evaluate its feasibility, fidelity, and usefulness. First, the&#xD;
      investigators will develop OPTIMAL through systematic integration of four PCMC principles,&#xD;
      prior work on multilevel facilitators and barriers to engaging residents in eating, and our&#xD;
      systematic review of mealtime difficulties and targeted behavioral strategies. The&#xD;
      investigators will use mixed methods (i.e., focus groups, a pilot two-group parallel cluster&#xD;
      RCT) to refine and test OPTIMAL. The investigators will enroll staff (N=20), families of&#xD;
      residents (N=20), and residents (N=20) in nursing homes (NHs). Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) OPTIMAL (i.e., training sessions, ongoing&#xD;
      mentoring, biweekly facilitations), and 2) education control (i.e., training sessions only).&#xD;
      In each treatment group, data will be collected at 3-time points: baseline (T1), immediately&#xD;
      post-intervention (6 weeks post-baseline, T2), and 6-week post-intervention (12 weeks&#xD;
      post-baseline, T3). At each time point, the investigators will assess the quality of staff&#xD;
      engagement and resident outcomes and collect videotaped observations of dyadic mealtime&#xD;
      interaction (videos) over 6 meals in 2 consecutive days (2 breakfasts, 2 lunches, 2 dinners)&#xD;
      for each staff-resident dyad. The investigators will use Cue Utilization and Engagement in&#xD;
      Dementia (CUED) mealtime video coding scheme, an innovative, feasible, and reliable tool that&#xD;
      our team has developed and validated, to assess a) staff PCMC&amp;TCMC behaviors, b) resident&#xD;
      mealtime difficulties and intake success rate using videos collected in this study. The&#xD;
      specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop, evaluate, and refine OPTIMAL intervention protocol and training materials. The&#xD;
           investigators will integrate evidence from literature and prior work to develop the&#xD;
           intervention protocol and training materials, addressing resident mealtime difficulties,&#xD;
           targeted PCMC strategies, and establishment of individualized PCMC plans. Separate focus&#xD;
           group interviews of staff and family participants on the acceptability and&#xD;
           appropriateness of the intervention protocol and training materials will be conducted&#xD;
           before pilot testing. Data obtained will be used to refine the intervention protocol and&#xD;
           training materials before pilot testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine feasibility, fidelity, and usefulness of OPTIMAL. Feasibility on participant&#xD;
           identification, recruitment, consent, and retention will be evaluated descriptively.&#xD;
           Fidelity will be assessed on a) delivery of treatment (staff attendance to training&#xD;
           sessions), b) receipt of treatment (staff knowledge and self-efficacy pre- &amp;&#xD;
           post-training), and c) enactment of treatment skills (staff PCMC&amp;TCMC behaviors, quality&#xD;
           of staff engagement). Focus group interviews of staff to assess the usefulness of&#xD;
           OPTIMAL will be conducted after T3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Describe resident outcomes (Exploratory). The investigators will measure and describe&#xD;
           resident mealtime difficulties, eating performance, intake success rate, body weight,&#xD;
           and body mass index using descriptive statistics overtime for two treatment groups. Data&#xD;
           obtained will inform estimates of effect sizes for a future larger-scale trial.&#xD;

    <description>The validated Cue Utilization and Engagement in Dementia (CUED) mealtime video coding scheme capturing both verbal and nonverbal behaviors that address staff person-centered and task-centered mealtime care strategies will be used to code video-recorded observations collected from the proposed study. Briefly, codes for verbal behaviors in CUED include 8 positive behaviors and 4 negative behaviors. Nonverbal behaviors include 7 negative behaviors and 13 positive behaviors in 3 categories: 1) modification of resident eating ability represented by 5 behaviors (e.g., &quot;adjusting pace&quot;), 2) modification of care approaches represented by 3 behaviors (e.g., &quot;adjusting proximity&quot;), and 3) modification of dining environment represented by 5 behaviors (e.g., &quot;reducing clutter&quot;).</description>
