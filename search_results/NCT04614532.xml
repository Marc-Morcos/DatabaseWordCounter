  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, with 900,000 people affected in&#xD;
      France in 2015 and a forecast of 1.3 million in 2020. As a consequence of their advanced age,&#xD;
      dementia patients often suffer from pain, mainly musculoskeletal or neuropathic pain.&#xD;
      However, the exact prevalence of pain in dementia is underestimated. Indeed, several studies&#xD;
      indicate that people suffering from dementia report less pain. This phenomenon is all the&#xD;
      more true as the stage of dementia is advanced. In addition, people with dementia receive&#xD;
      less pain medication than people without cognitive impairment in similarly painful&#xD;
      conditions. Hetero-evaluation alone also seems insufficient, with the result that pain is&#xD;
      under-treated compared to patients without cognitive impairment. Better pain screening is a&#xD;
      major challenge and self-assessment tools should be favoured as a first line of treatment,&#xD;
      even for patients with cognitive impairment. suffering from dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose in this work to evaluate the variation of vegetative parameters&#xD;
      that accompany a painful stimulus. These variations can be recorded at the cardiac, vascular,&#xD;
      pupillary or skin conductance level.&#xD;

      It will therefore be a question of inducing experimental pain in patients with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, in the early stages of the disease and to check whether pain-related changes in the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system via the Nociception Level index (NoL® system) differ from a control&#xD;
      group of subjects matched in age, gender and education level. To induce pain, the&#xD;
      investigators will use the &quot;cold pressor test&quot; technique, which consists of leaving the arm&#xD;
      immersed in ice water for as long as the pain is bearable. The investigators will also record&#xD;
      before, during and after the immersion, the variations of several parameters derived from the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system during the painful stimulation via the NoL® system. During this&#xD;
      experience, the participants will be filmed in their entirety to observe the facial emotions&#xD;
      related to pain.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects will be fully filmed during the procedure. The video will be analyzed after experimentation, thanks to the Facereader® software. Facereader® is a fully automated system for the recognition of facial expressions, allowing an objective evaluation of the emotion of the topics. It uses the Viola-Jones algorithm allowing a 3D modeling of the face as well as the taking in account of the texture of the face. Then, each unit of action of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) will be assigned to the face. of the patient. The five facial expressions of pain will be integrated into the software allowing them to be automatic recognition. The parameters used will be the intensity of the emotion expression (from 0 to 100).</description>

    <description>consists of the complete immersion of the participant's arm in a basin of cold water maintained at a temperature.&#xD;
The test will be divided into two conditions (pain, no pain). In the first, the container will be filled with cold water. In the second, the water in the container will be at room temperature. The investigators will test each arm. During the immersion of the arm, participants will have to remain silent and remove their arm when the ordeal becomes too painful for the painful condition.&#xD;
For the non-painful condition, the immersion time will be determined according to the results of the pre test.</description>
