  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The eRADAR Brain Health Study seeks to refine and test a novel, low-cost strategy for&#xD;
      increasing dementia detection within primary care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      eRADAR stands for &quot;electronic health record (EHR) Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment&#xD;
      Rule.&quot; It is a low-cost tool or algorithm that uses readily available EHR data elements to&#xD;
      identify high-risk patients. We will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      assess the impact of implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process on dementia&#xD;
      detection rates. We will also explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on healthcare&#xD;
      utilization and patient experience.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>This Individual Participant Data (IPD) plan applies to all quantitative study data, such as data collected specifically for the study and those derived from electronic health records (EHR), as well as the data collected via planned study surveys, which include only short qualitative free-text fields. We do not plan to share transcripts from in-depth qualitative interviews or recorded study assessment visits.&#xD;
Data will be maintained on secure servers behind the firewalls at the two study sites: Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). De-identified or limited datasets containing individual-level data on which publications are based will be made available to qualified researchers for specified analyses. We will make the data available to users only under a data-use agreement (DUA).</ipd_description>

    <ipd_time_frame>Data can be requested after the primary study paper is accepted for publication, up until 5 years after study completion.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Individuals interested in using KPWA data will be required to complete a standard form, sign a Data Use Agreement (DUA) and provide documentation of IRB approval. Data may then be accessed by qualified researchers via KPWA's Secure File Transfer (SFT) site. User registration will be required in order to access or download data files. As part of the registration process, users must agree to the conditions of use governing access to the data, including restrictions against attempting to identify study participants, destruction of the data after analyses are completed, reporting responsibilities, restrictions on redistribution of the data to third parties, and proper acknowledgement of the data resource.&#xD;
Individuals interested in using UCSF data will be required to complete the same data request form. The UCSF Industry Contracts Division (ICD), which oversees incoming and outgoing transfer of all UCSF data, will review the form for compliance with UCSF policies.</ipd_access_criteria>
