  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) represents a group of persons who are at risk of incident&#xD;
      dementia in the near-term. Persons with MCI who have deficits in short-term recall (amnestic&#xD;
      MCI) are at significant risk of incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) (termed prodromal AD), and&#xD;
      thus represent a worthy target for secondary prevention interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing evidence that risk factors for metabolic syndrome (such as prediabetes&#xD;
      and type 2 diabetes) increase risk of incident cognitive impairment and possibly AD, and&#xD;
      evidence that the neurons of the AD brain are in fact insulin resistant with diminished&#xD;
      glucose uptake under physiological conditions. Thus, persons with MCI and prediabetes or type&#xD;
      2 diabetes may be at particular risk of incident cognitive impairment and AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large clinical trial (ACCORD)1 demonstrated that tight control of peripheral blood glucose&#xD;
      does not improve cognitive (or other health) outcomes in older persons with peripheral&#xD;
      insulin resistance. Thus, there is a need to target cognitive outcomes in persons with MCI&#xD;
      and metabolic risk factors, and a drug targeting insulin resistance with good&#xD;
      blood-brain-barrier (BBB) penetrance can potentially accomplish these objectives. While there&#xD;
      is a phase III study of intranasal insulin targeting this strategy, nutraceuticals offer a&#xD;
      low-tech solution that would be more suitable to future secondary prevention trials in MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioactive Dietary Polyphenol Preparation (BDPP) is a combination of two nutraceutical&#xD;
      preparations grape seed polyphenolic extract (GSE), and resveratrol that contain abundant&#xD;
      concentrations of polyphenols. The investigators have found that oral BDPP administration was&#xD;
      associated with improved cognition and brain plasticity long-term potentiation (LTP) in mouse&#xD;
      models of metabolic syndrome and AD, as well as lowering brain amyloid and tau burden in an&#xD;
      AD mouse model2-4. The investigators have demonstrated excellent absorption of oral BDPP in a&#xD;
      small study in humans and similarly excellent CSF penetration of oral BDPP in rats, but it is&#xD;
      crucial to demonstrate safety and CSF penetration of oral BDPP in humans to assess its&#xD;
      potential as a treatment for MCI and prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
