  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal aging is associated with a progressive decline in cognitive functions, especially&#xD;
      memory. This decline in cognitive function can negatively impact the quality of life of older&#xD;
      adults. Although there are currently few possibilities to prevent and/or slow the signs of&#xD;
      cognitive decline, both those associated with age and neurodegenerative pathologies, one of&#xD;
      the non-invasive brain stimulation techniques that has gained attention in recent years is&#xD;
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a technique based on the application&#xD;
      of a low-intensity (&lt; 2 mA) direct electrical current between two large-area electrodes&#xD;
      placed on various surface areas of the head. Moreover, according to safety-related&#xD;
      meta-analyses it is a very safe technique, without any major side effects, provided that&#xD;
      internationally established safety protocols are taken into account in its application. This&#xD;
      technique has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for both healthy elderly&#xD;
      people and people with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in several cognitive&#xD;
      variables, having shown encouraging results in working memory learning curves, modulation of&#xD;
      plasticity and recognition tasks. This project aims to implement an intervention using&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation in healthy older adults, MCI and AD. The main&#xD;
      objective is to test if there is an improvement in cognitive efficiency and if the changes&#xD;
      are maintained over time (1 month). For this purpose, the effect of the technique will be&#xD;
      studied on participants assigned to treatment and control groups, analyzing the possible&#xD;
      modifications in the following cognitive variables: cognitive plasticity and learning&#xD;
      potential, recognition and familiarity and false alarms.&#xD;
