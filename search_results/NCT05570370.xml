  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data collection based on this study will allow us to collect neurophysiological and cognitive&#xD;
      data collected from in-ear EEG recordings of the Autosomal dominant alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      population in Colombia&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is solid neurophysiological evidence indicating that abnormal brain rhythms during&#xD;
      sleep and noradrenergic dysfunction are core components of cognitive decline and AD onset,&#xD;
      and their related pathophysiology. Crucially, irregularities in these neurophysiological&#xD;
      mechanisms appear to occur in an asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic stage, but their potential&#xD;
      to identify susceptibility for triggering neurodegeneration has yet to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the possibility to identify such risk biomarkers in humans will require the acquisition&#xD;
      of large-scale data related direct or indirect measurements of these physiological&#xD;
      signatures. A possible key source to obtain such large-scale data related to sleep and&#xD;
      noradrenergic function is the assessment of electroencephalographic recordings through&#xD;
      non-obtrusive, low-cost, and reliable wearable sensors, alongside the use of advanced&#xD;
      neuro-computational algorithms that link brain function and behavioral outcomes of LC&#xD;
      function via pupilometry measurements.&#xD;

    <description>atent variables of the LC-noradrenergic neuro-computational model based on our cognitive task will indicate the state in wich the participant is (exploration vs exploitation). The relative phasic pupilometry responses in these two states will serve as a proxy of the degree of LC-noradrenergic reaction to these states. The relative reactivity will be compared in both groups (mutation vs non-mutation carriers)</description>

    <description>We will evaluate the the differences spatio-temporal changes in the power spectrum depending on the state in wich the participant is (exploration vs exploitation) in the cognitive task.

        Participation in another study with investigational drug/therapy/interventions within the&#xD;
        30 days preceding and during the present study (start date adapted accordingly) Suspected&#xD;

        safety related, but relevant for data interpretation procedures given that pregnancy can&#xD;

        characterize) Additional non-medical exclusion criteria may be defined for certain&#xD;
        cognitive tasks (e.g. no glasses during experiments involving pupillometry).&#xD;
