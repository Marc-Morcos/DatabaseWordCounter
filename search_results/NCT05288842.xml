  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic and hormonal deregulations are both a risk factor and a hallmark of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), occurring early in the course of the disease.&#xD;
      In FTD in particular, hyperorality and dietary changes are associated with metabolic and&#xD;
      hormonal changes such as altered levels of the anorexigenic hormone leptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothalamus is a brain region that controls metabolism and hormonal systems.&#xD;
      Hypothalamic function depends on its ability to sense peripheral signals. The hypothalamus&#xD;
      sits on a circumventricular organ called the median eminence (ME) that puts it in contact&#xD;
      with systemic blood circulation. In the ME, fenestrated capillaries allow the diffusion of&#xD;
      bloodborne factors. However, despite the lack of blood-brain barrier at brain microvessels,&#xD;
      diffusion is controlled by specialized ependymoglial cells, the tanycytes, which exert a&#xD;
      barrier function between the ME and the third ventricle and controls the access of&#xD;
      blood-borne molecules into the hypothalamus. Previous work from our laboratory and the ERC&#xD;
      consortium has highlighted the role of tanycytes not only in the regulation of the release of&#xD;
      neurohormones from neuroendocrine nerve terminals into the pituitary portal blood&#xD;
      circulation, but also in the transport of circulating leptin into the hypothalamus. Hence&#xD;
      hypothalamic dysfunction in AD and FTD can result either from dysregulation of neuroendocrine&#xD;
      secretions, direct neuronal loss or from defective transport (and hence resistance) to&#xD;
      hormones like leptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to demonstrate that leptin transport though tanycytes is early altered in FTD&#xD;
      and AD and correlates&#xD;
