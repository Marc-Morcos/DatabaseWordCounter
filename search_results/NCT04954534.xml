    <measure>Change from the baseline in ADAS-Cog</measure>
    <time_frame>4weeks,8weeks,12weeks,24 weeks after the first dose</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAS-Cog is a psychometric instrument that evaluates memory, attention, reasoning, language, orientation, and praxis using an 11-point AD Assessment Scale. It has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum severity score of 70, and a higher score indicates more impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CDR-SOB</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks after the first dose</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR-SOB(Clinical Dementia Rating, Sum of Boxes) is a global rating of dementia severity based on the clinician's interpretation of the history and examination. The range of this instrument is 0 to 18 with higher numbers indicating greater impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from the baseline in K-MMSE(korean version)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks after the first dose</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE(Mini-Mental State Examination) is a brief, practical test for cognitive dysfunction. The test consists of five sections (orientation, registration, attention-calculation, recall, and language) and results in a total possible score from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better function</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from the baseline in CGA-NPI</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks after the first dose</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver-administered Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Measure abnormal behavior. The score range is 0-144. A higher score means severe abnormal behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from the baseline in SIB</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks after the first dose</time_frame>
    <description>The Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) is an assessment of cognitive dysfunction across nine domains such as memory, language, and orientation. The score ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ADAS-Cog Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>The ADAS-cog response is defined as no worsening (no change or improvement on ADAS-cog score) of the ADAS-cog score at 24 weeks after the first administration compared to the baseline</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CIBIC-plus</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks after the first dose</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-plus(CIBIC-plus) is a rating scale derived from an interview with the patient and caregiver with an independent rater designed to measure several domains of patient function, such as mental/cognitive state, behavior, and activities of daily living. The scores range from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening).</description>
