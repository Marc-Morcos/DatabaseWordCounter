    <textblock>
      The aim of Patient-Centred Innovations for Persons With Multimorbidity (PACE in MM) study is&#xD;
      to reorient the health care system from a single disease focus to a multimorbidity focus;&#xD;
      centre on not only disease but also the patient in context; and realign the health care&#xD;
      system from separate silos to coordinated collaborations in care. PACE in MM will propose&#xD;
      multifaceted innovations in Chronic Disease Prevention and Management (CDPM) that will be&#xD;
      grounded in current realities (i.e. Chronic Care Models including Self-Management Programs),&#xD;
      that are linked to Primary Care (PC) reform efforts. The study will build on this firm&#xD;
      foundation, will design and test promising innovations and will achieve transformation by&#xD;
      creating structures to sustain relationships among researchers, decision-makers,&#xD;
      practitioners, and patients. The Team will conduct inter-jurisdictional comparisons and is&#xD;
      mainly a Quebec (QC) - Ontario (ON) collaboration with participation from 3 other provinces:&#xD;
      British Columbia (BC); Manitoba (MB); and Nova Scotia (NS). The Team's objectives are: 1) to&#xD;
      identify factors responsible for success or failure of current CDPM programs linked to the PC&#xD;
      reform, by conducting a realist synthesis of their quantitative and qualitative evaluations;&#xD;
      2) to transform consenting CDPM programs identified in Objective 1, by aligning them to&#xD;
      promising interventions on patient-centred care for multimorbidity patients, and to test&#xD;
      these new innovations' in at least two jurisdictions and compare among jurisdictions; and 3)&#xD;
      to foster the scaling-up of innovations informed by Objective 1 and tested/proven in&#xD;
      Objective 2, and to conduct research on different approaches to scaling-up. This registration&#xD;
      for Clinical Trials only pertains to Objective 2 of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recent systematic review on the prevalence of Multimorbidity (MM) recommended a count of 3+&#xD;
      chronic diseases, with no focus on any single chronic disease in particular. This definition&#xD;
      identifies a more vulnerable population with higher needs, lower income or poverty, poorer&#xD;
      outcomes and challenging processes of care. It includes people with a wide array of&#xD;
      complexity from the uncomplicated course of minimally interacting chronic diseases to the&#xD;
      highly complex MM patients. MM is not only important due to the burden on patients, but&#xD;
      because it accounts for high utilization. The definition represents a continuum of&#xD;
      vulnerability in which there are many opportunities for prevention and management. Despite&#xD;
      the high prevalence of MM, most research and health care is still based on a single disease&#xD;
      paradigm which may not be appropriate as 45% of primary care patients have MM. A recent&#xD;
      Cochrane systematic review on the impact of interventions for patients with MM has identified&#xD;
      a paucity of studies internationally with mixed results, thus paving the way for the work of&#xD;
      this Team. The most promising intervention, to date, was enhanced teamwork in a multifaceted&#xD;
      intervention involving multiple professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-Centred Partnerships between Patients and Providers: The definition of&#xD;
      patient-centred partnerships is derived from Canadian policy reports: &quot;collaboration between&#xD;
      informed, respected patients and a healthcare team.&quot; There is an internationally accepted&#xD;
      comprehensive operational definition with four components which will guide many aspects of&#xD;
      the proposed research program: first, exploring the patients' diseases and the illness&#xD;
      experience; second, understanding the whole person in context; third, finding common ground;&#xD;
      and fourth, enhancing the patient-provider relationship. There is empirical evidence for the&#xD;
      impact of patient-centred partnerships on better patient outcomes and lower costs. Systematic&#xD;
      reviews of interventions indicated promising results for feasible practice-based&#xD;
      interventions targeting both providers and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canadian policy reports defined this second facet of patient-centredness, as &quot;seamless&#xD;
      coordination and integration of care.&quot; Transitions requiring coordination are a key feature&#xD;
      of care for patients with MM. Coordination has been shown to positively impact: symptom&#xD;
      relief; social functioning; hospital re-admission and related costs. Papers reviewed by this&#xD;
      Team identified the most promising type of intervention to be structured delivery system&#xD;
      re-design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY #2.1 Qualitative Evaluation of the aligned Programs Purpose: The study will: assess how&#xD;
      the transformed program performs; distinguish between components of the interventions; and&#xD;
      identify contextual factors that may have influenced the content and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention. It will also examine the local barriers and facilitators as well as the&#xD;
      transitions and coordination of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and design: The Team will conduct a qualitative evaluation of the transformed&#xD;
      programs to explain how various contexts influence observed effects [1] including the context&#xD;
      of the health care systems in each province. A recent example of this research approach in&#xD;
      Canada is Best et al, 2012 [2]. Data will be obtained from interviews and written documents.&#xD;
      In-depth interviews will be conducted among the four categories of stakeholders. This will&#xD;
      include: a) decision-makers (n = 10); b) primary care physicians (n = 10); c) professionals&#xD;
      doing the interventions (n = 10); and a d) purposive sample of patients with multimorbidity&#xD;
      (n = 10) and their informal caregivers (n=10) [51]. The number of interviews are estimates&#xD;
      and will be guided by the saturation of data [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: In-depth interviews, lasting 30 to 60 minutes will ensure complete and&#xD;
      detailed participation. The data collection will be held during the second year of the&#xD;
      transformed program. The interview guides will examine how the context variables influence&#xD;
      the effects and the elements that could potentially inform the development of future&#xD;
      interventions. All interviews will be audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Additionally,&#xD;
      written documents will be collected (program team meeting summaries, a sample of 10 medical&#xD;
      records or research records at each participating site, a checklist describing the fidelity&#xD;
      of the intervention, all documents produced specifically for the intervention) to provide an&#xD;
      in-depth understanding of the various contexts in which the interventions occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The data will be analyzed using an iterative and interpretative approach [4].&#xD;
      The data from all participants will be examined through both independent and team analysis&#xD;
      occurring in a concurrent manner to build and develop on the emerging themes. A coding&#xD;
      template will be developed and edited as new themes emerge while others are reclassified or&#xD;
      discarded. A data management software will be used to organize the coded data and identify&#xD;
      exemplar quotes reflecting the central themes. All written documents will undergo a content&#xD;
      analysis. The final step of the analysis will be the triangulation of the synthesis of the&#xD;
      themes from the stakeholder participants and the content analysis of the documents.[3-4]&#xD;
      STUDY #2.2: Evaluation of effects of the aligned Programs Setting: The same consenting&#xD;
      participating sites as described in study 2.1. The methods presented below are for one&#xD;
      setting and will be duplicated in the second setting. Patients are referred to receive the&#xD;
      services of these programs by their providers. The intervention the investigators are testing&#xD;
      here is the aligned programs. Patients referred to these programs are new patients and have&#xD;
      never been exposed to the intervention. In addition to the main reason for referral to the&#xD;
      program, the referral form will also include eligibility details for the evaluation,&#xD;
      including diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient sample: Patients recruited for the study will be cognitively intact and literate and&#xD;
      aged between 18 and 80 years of age. The upper limit of 80 years is to avoid recruiting&#xD;
      patients at risk of being institutionalized or dependent during the follow-up. Patients will&#xD;
      present at least three chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Design: Patients agreeing to participate will complete questionnaires at baseline&#xD;
      (T1) collecting the sociodemographic data and baseline measures, which will be used to&#xD;
      document equivalence between groups (groups are defined below). Effectiveness of the aligned&#xD;
      program will be assessed using three strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure short-term effects (4 months), a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design&#xD;
           with a delayed intervention will be used [5]. Eligible patients will be randomized after&#xD;
           consent to receive either the intervention within a short period of time (Group A) or 4&#xD;
           months later (Group B); self-reported mailed questionnaires will be completed at&#xD;
           baseline (T1) for all patient participants, 4 months after the end of the intervention&#xD;
           for group A (T2) and 4 months after baseline for control group B (T2). This will&#xD;
           constitute the short-term measure of effectiveness of the intervention. Group B will&#xD;
           then receive the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the mid-term effects (one year) on patient-reported outcomes, a before and&#xD;
           after study is proposed combining groups A and B together. The patients will complete&#xD;
           the same questionnaire 12 months after the end of the intervention (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To measure mid-term (T3) and long-term effects (T4 after 2 years) on health services&#xD;
           utilization and cost, all patients (groups A and B) will provide consent to give access&#xD;
           to their health administrative (HA) data. At baseline, a control Group C will be&#xD;
           constituted using anonymized HA data. Patients will be matched for gender, age, region&#xD;
           and main three diagnoses. The Team will build algorithms for matching every set of&#xD;
           controls. Groups A and B together will be compared to this propensity matched control&#xD;
           group C in a before-after study using administrative (HA) data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables and outcome measures: The variables fall into 5 categories: sociodemographic; PC&#xD;
      context; main co-variables of interest; primary outcomes; secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      Socio-demographic characteristics include gender, age, education, family income, marital&#xD;
      status, occupation, housing and number of persons living under the same roof. Context&#xD;
      variables refer to type of PC organization in which the intervention occurs (Family Medicine&#xD;
      Group). The three main co-variables of interest are the Team's three innovations:&#xD;
      self-reported multimorbidity (measured by the Disease Burden Morbidity Assessment [6];&#xD;
      patient-centred partnership (Patient Perception of Patient-Centredness Scale [7-9]); and&#xD;
      Patient centered coordination (the Patient Perceptions of Transitions in care, adapted by the&#xD;
      investigators from Coleman [10]). The two primary outcome measures are the Health Education&#xD;
      Impact Questionnaire (HeiQ) that provides a broad profile of the potential impacts of patient&#xD;
      education interventions [11] and the level of perceived disease-management self-efficacy&#xD;
      using the 6-item Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease (SEM-CD) [12]. Secondary patient&#xD;
      perceived outcomes will be the VR-12 as a measure of health status and the &quot;EuroQoL group&quot;&#xD;
      instrument called &quot;EQ5D&quot; as a measure of Quality of Life [13]. The Kessler psychological&#xD;
      distress scale K-6 will measure psychological distress [14]. The investigators will also use&#xD;
      a questionnaire on health behaviors [15]. Finally, HA data will also be used as secondary&#xD;
      outcomes to compare health care utilization and cost before and after the intervention. HA&#xD;
      data will include emergency department visits, avoidable hospital admissions, readmissions,&#xD;
      time to first primary care visit after emergency department visit and continuity of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Investigators will first describe participants' baseline characteristics in&#xD;
      each group and compare among groups. To evaluate short-term effect, Groups A and B will be&#xD;
      compared on T2 scores with an analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) adjusted for T1 scores [16].&#xD;
      To document mid-term effects, a before and after measures analysis of variance will be used&#xD;
      to study the evolution of continuous variables collected 3 times [17]. Sub-analyses by gender&#xD;
      will be performed. Health system costs in intervention and control groups will be evaluated&#xD;
      by using amounts paid to providers based on provincial fee schedules and cost-weighted&#xD;
      utilization of institutions including hospitals and long-term care. Utilization records&#xD;
      obtained from HA data will be multiplied by applicable cost weights [18] The methods employed&#xD;
      will model the individual patient-level costs incurred in the health system, using methods&#xD;
      developed for costing using administrative data[19]. Incremental resources in the&#xD;
      intervention group will be identified and costed using applicable time/resource inputs and&#xD;
      relevant wage rates following guidelines for economic evaluation in health interventions&#xD;
      [20].&#xD;
