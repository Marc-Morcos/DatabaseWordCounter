  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a presymptomatic course which can last from several years to&#xD;
      decades. Identification of subjects at an early stage is crucial for therapeutic intervention&#xD;
      and possible prevention of cognitive decline. Current research is focused on identifying&#xD;
      characteristics of the early stages of AD and several concepts have been developed to that&#xD;
      end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is defined as a self-experienced persistent decline in&#xD;
      cognitive capacity in comparison with the subject's previously normal status, during which&#xD;
      the subject has normal age-, gender-, and education-adjusted performance on standardized&#xD;
      cognitive tests. SCD is not related to current cognitive impairment, however it has been&#xD;
      considered for its potential role as risk factors for AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate, through machine learning tools, the accuracy data,&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment, personality traits, cognitive reserve, genetic factors,&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurodegeneration biomarkers, EEG and Event Related Potential&#xD;
      recordings in predicting conversion from SCD condition, to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)&#xD;
      and AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Regional Reference Center for Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Disorders of Careggi&#xD;
      Hospital, Florence, started about 25 years ago to collect clinical, neuropsychological,&#xD;
      personality and lifestyles data for patients with of Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD).&#xD;
      Starting from these data the aim of the present study is to increase the number of variables&#xD;
      collected on SCD subjects and expand the clinical follow-up to delineate more accurate&#xD;
      pathway of disease and to identify very early subject at risk of conversion in Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of detection of cognitive impairment at the early stages are critical. Such&#xD;
      detection has traditionally been performed manually by one or more clinicians based on&#xD;
      reports and test results. Machine learning algorithms offer a method of detection that may&#xD;
      provide an automated process and valuable insights into diagnosis and classification. With&#xD;
      this tool clinicians could design optimal screenings to predict, already at the stage of SCD,&#xD;
      possible evolutions of the patient's conditions, and, through decisional protocols, establish&#xD;
      the degree of appropriateness of the investigations/exam to perform for each patient, based&#xD;
      on current state of risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate, through machine learning tools, the accuracy of&#xD;
      clinical data, neuropsychological assessment, personality traits, cognitive reserve, genetic&#xD;
      factors, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurodegeneration biomarkers and features from EEG and&#xD;
      event-related potentials (ERP) in predicting conversion from SCD condition, to Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (MCI) and AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo a comprehensive familial and clinical history, general and&#xD;
      neurological examination, extensive neuropsychological battery (about 19 tests exploring all&#xD;
      cognitive domains: memory, attention, executive functions, language, praxis), estimation of&#xD;
      premorbid intelligence (TIB - Test di Intelligenza Breve, an Italian version of the National&#xD;
      Adult Reading Test - NART), personality traits (Big Five Factors Questionnaire - BFFQ), and&#xD;
      leisure activities evaluation (structured interviewed regarding participation in&#xD;
      intellectual, sporting and social activities) as well as assessment of depression (Hamilton&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale - HDRS). Moreover, all patients will undergo a CSF analysis to assess&#xD;
      established biomarkers (AÎ²42, total tau, p-tau) and blood samples for DNA analysis will be&#xD;
      collected to identify the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor&#xD;
      (BDNF) genotypes. In particular, will be analyzed three different single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms (SNPs):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BDNF SNP Val66Met (valine-methionine substitution) was already associated with poorer&#xD;
           episodic memory and abnormal hippocampal activation assayed with MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  APOE gene rs429358 and rs7412 that are involved in the Amyloid plaque formation Only&#xD;
           clinical and neuropsychological assessment are repeated yearly in order to evaluate&#xD;
           progression of decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sub-sample will be selected including all new cases of SCD included in the study (about&#xD;
      50), all subjects converted to MCI (about 25), and all patients, already studied, who report&#xD;
      a subjective cognitive disorder for less than 10 years (about 75).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This selected sub-sample will also perform additional investigations: CSF biomarkers, resting&#xD;
      state EEG recordings and ERP registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For about 150 subject the EEG activity will be recorded. The participants will be&#xD;
      administered an ERP test battery with concurrently recorded EEG. Analysis of EEG data, in&#xD;
      particular, will start with a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline (PREP&#xD;
      Pipeline) focusing on high-filtering at 1 Hz, the identification of bad channels and the&#xD;
      calculation of a robust average reference. The investigators will perform signal epoching&#xD;
      using fixed length epochs for resting state measurements, and stimulus-locked epochs for&#xD;
      signals acquired during tasks. Epochs containing artifactual signal will be removed with a&#xD;
      semi-automatic procedure. The investigators will then apply independent component analysis&#xD;
      (ICA) to the data, followed by a semiautomatic detection of artifactual components based on&#xD;
      measures of autocorrelation, correlation with EOG electrode, focal channel topography and&#xD;
      quality of mono-source dipole fitting. Finally, the investigators will compute power features&#xD;
      at the sensor space, i.e. frequency bands powers, and linear/non-linear functional&#xD;
      connectivity metrics, i.e. direct transfer function and mutual information, at the source&#xD;
      level after a source reconstruction procedure, i.e. Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic&#xD;
      Tomography (LORETA) method (Pascual-Marqui et, al 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine learning analysis will proceed as follows. The first analysis will include all the&#xD;
      patients that were diagnosed with SCD in the preliminary work. The investigators will define&#xD;
      a set of multi-modal features including all the 19 neuropsychological tests, a selection of&#xD;
      the personality assessments and the genetic profile. The investigators will define a common&#xD;
      metrics based on the dispersion of each single dimension of the profile and then they will&#xD;
      train a machine learning algorithm to associate each profile &quot;vector&quot; to the associated&#xD;
      evolution of the disease after a fixed time (at first the possible categories will be only&#xD;
      SCD, MCI, AD with no further sublevels, but this can be improved in further rounds). First,&#xD;
      the investigators will perform this classification with standard machine learning procedures&#xD;
      as support vector machine (SVM, using binary decisions trees) and k-nearest neighbors (kNN).&#xD;
      Then they will exploit the fact that neurophysiological assessments are repeated yearly (see&#xD;
      above) to use the SuStaIn algorithm previously applied to neuroimaging data (see state of the&#xD;
      art and Young 2018). Briefly, the algorithm z-scores each dimension of the profile and models&#xD;
      with a piece-wise linear function the different paths of accumulations of each marker, i.e.&#xD;
      the progression from healthy to abnormal values. This approach does not only outperform&#xD;
      standard algorithms in predicting the final condition of the subjects based on the starting&#xD;
      profile but highlight the different paths that can lead to the same outcome. In a separate&#xD;
      set of analysis, the investigators will follow a deep learning approach, using exactly the&#xD;
      same subject profiles to train a multi-level feedforward artificial neural network (ANN)&#xD;
      predicting the condition of the patient after a fixed time. The networks will be trained with&#xD;
      standard gradient descent and backpropagation techniques and by means of dropout and batch&#xD;
      normalization procedures the investigators will obtain robust automatic classification&#xD;
      results. Comparing SuStaIn and ANN classification performance they will decide the most&#xD;
      convenient approach for the task. Moreover, they will apply standard dimensionality reduction&#xD;
      techniques to extract the most salient features and repeat the procedure described above to&#xD;
      assess whether it is possible to achieve the same results with a subset of the screenings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected approach will be then repeated to the novel patients recruited during PREVIEW&#xD;
      and those undergoing follow up analysis during the project. The only difference will be the&#xD;
      novel set of factors included in the analysis, including all the data used in the first&#xD;
      version but also BDNF, CSF biomarkers, and the novel features extracted from resting state&#xD;
      EEG recordings and ERP. This will require defining a second multi-modal metrics across all&#xD;
      features, and a consequent reshaping and retraining of the machine learning network. As&#xD;
      described above, even for the second version of the algorithm the investigators will aim at&#xD;
      defining the minimal set of features achieving the optimal performance. The final outcome of&#xD;
      the algorithm will provide a prediction of the evolution of the condition for each patient&#xD;
      based on his/her complete profile.&#xD;
