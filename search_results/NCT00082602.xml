  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an extended release&#xD;
      formulation of the drug galantamine using a rapid dose escalation regimen.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To improve dosing convenience of the current formulation of galantamine, a new once daily&#xD;
      dosing Extended Release (ER) formulation was developed. In a different large study, in which&#xD;
      approximately 900 patients with Alzheimer's disease participated, efficacy of the Extended&#xD;
      Release formulation was confirmed. During the first 8 weeks of treatment, nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      occurred less frequently with the Extended Release than Intermittent Release formulation.&#xD;
      This suggests that patients might better tolerate a rapid dose escalation to the initial&#xD;
      maintenance dose of 16mg daily, thereby improving the risk/benefit ratio during the first 4&#xD;
      weeks of therapy, i.e. receiving more drug sooner. The trial objectives are: 1) to&#xD;
      demonstrate the safety and tolerability of galantamine Extended Release 16 mg daily when&#xD;
      titrated from 8 mg daily after one week; 2) to evaluate the effect of galantamine Extended&#xD;
      Release on cognition as measured by the Mini Mental State Examination. Results from prior&#xD;
      trials show that galantamine Intermittent Release (twice a day dosing) has a high rate of&#xD;
      adverse events when dose escalations occur at one-week intervals. Therefore, current&#xD;
      galantamine labelling recommends that the drug dose be escalated once every 4 weeks. The&#xD;
      study hypotheis is that the rapid dose escalation of the Extended Release formulation in&#xD;
      subjects with Alzheimer's disease is safe and well tolerated. Comparison of adverse event&#xD;
      rates will be made to the first 8 weeks Reminyl Extended Release group of another trial in&#xD;
      which the Extended Release formulation was titrated from 8 mg daily to 16 mg daily at 4&#xD;
      weeks. Subjects will receive galantamine Extended Release capsules by mouth starting at 8 mg&#xD;
      daily and after one week will be titrated up to 16 mg daily. This dose will be maintained for&#xD;
      11 additional weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 mg of Galantamine Extended Release Capsules once daily for one week. After one week will be&#xD;
      titrated up to 16 mg daily for 11 weeks.&#xD;
