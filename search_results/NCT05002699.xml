    <textblock>
      The 'Investigating the Impact of Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostics in British Columbia'&#xD;
      (IMPACT-AD BC) study is an observational, longitudinal cohort study that will examine the&#xD;
      impact of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for core Alzheimer's disease biomarkers on&#xD;
      clinical decision making, diagnosis and health system utilization. In addition to data&#xD;
      collection from physicians, the study will engage patients and their care partners in&#xD;
      assessing the value of biomarker testing. IMPACT-AD BC investigators hypothesize that testing&#xD;
      for CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in individuals with cognitive impairment, as part&#xD;
      of routine clinical care, improves clinical management, diagnostic certainty, diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy, and healthcare resource utilization, and that patients and their care partners find&#xD;
      the information valuable in planning for the future.&#xD;

      The IMPACT-AD BC study is an observational, longitudinal cohort study designed to understand&#xD;
      the impact of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for core Alzheimer's disease biomarkers on&#xD;
      clinical decision making, diagnosis, health system utilization, and patients and their care&#xD;
      partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dementia specialists from multiple sites in the Canadian province of British Columbia will be&#xD;
      approached to provide informed consent to participate. When these physicians order&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarker testing as part of routine care (DeMarco et al 2020), their&#xD;
      patients will be eligible to participate in the study. Eligible patients (the patient&#xD;
      participants) and their study partners (e.g., a family member or care partner) will be&#xD;
      approached to provide informed consent to participate. The dementia specialists will provide&#xD;
      diagnosis and management plans for their consenting patient participants before and after&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarker results. One year after release of the Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      CSF biomarker results, dementia specialists complete another questionnaire to assess the&#xD;
      stability of their responses. In addition to these data, the study will collect patient&#xD;
      participant/care partner perspectives on CSF biomarker testing post-results disclosure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Via the IMPACT-AD BC study, the investigators will collect the first data of its kind on the&#xD;
      utility of CSF biomarkers in routine care in Canada, with the overall goal of improving care&#xD;
      and support systems for individuals living with neurodegenerative disorders.&#xD;

        Patient participants presenting with suspected preclinical, prodromal and Alzheimer's&#xD;
        dementia, and meeting the appropriate use criteria for lumbar puncture and CSF biomarker&#xD;
        testing (Shaw et al., 2018), will be enrolled along with their study partner and referring&#xD;
        dementia specialist. A dementia specialist is defined as a self-identified physician&#xD;
        trained and board-certified in neurology, psychiatry, or geriatric medicine who devotes a&#xD;
        substantial proportion (â‰¥ 25%) of patient contact time to the evaluation and care of adults&#xD;
        with acquired cognitive impairment or dementia (Johnson et al., 2013).&#xD;
