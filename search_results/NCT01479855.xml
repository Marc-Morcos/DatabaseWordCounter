      The purpose of the study is to compare the concentrations of Vitamin B1 (thiamine), Vitamin&#xD;
      B6 (pyridoxal-5-phosphate), folate, Vitamin B12 (cobalamin), Vitamin C (ascorbic acid),&#xD;
      Vitamin A (retinol), Vitamin E (alfa-tocopherol), homocystein, uric acid, F2 8-α-isoprostane,&#xD;
      8-deoxyguanosine, retinoids, tau-protein and β-amyloid in spinal fluid, metabolomics,&#xD;
      proteomics, m-RNA for DNA repair enzymes and DNA in patients who suffer from mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (MCI) or mild dementia of Alzheimers type, with healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second aim is to explore the association between vitamin and nutrient reductions, if any,&#xD;
      and cognitive function as well as vascular score and possible changes in the MRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia of the Alzheimer type (AD) is a serious illness affecting 60-70 000 people in Norway&#xD;
      with an estimated cost of 12 Billion NOK (Norwegian kroner) per year. The Department of&#xD;
      Social Affairs and Health has initiated psycho-social intervention programs for patients as&#xD;
      well as caregivers, however, no research regarding etiology, pathology or prevention of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an earlier pilot study conducted on AD patients in a moderate stage, there were&#xD;
      significant decrease in the concentrations of the vitamins thiamine, pyridoxal-5 phosphate,&#xD;
      ascorbic acid retinol, cobalamin, and increased homocystein, compared with the control group&#xD;
      of healthy elderly people. Logistic regression analysis showed that 5 models using different&#xD;
      combinations of vitamins and spinal protein, all completely separating patients with dementia&#xD;
      from healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a replication of the above mentioned study, and will include up to 120&#xD;
      AD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia (MMSE above 24/30) and up&#xD;
      to 60 healthy elderly controls. Measurement of vitamines and nutrients in blood and spinal&#xD;
      fluid is the central element of the study. The specimens will therefore be obtained from&#xD;
      patients and controls who have abstained from supplements the last four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will include biochemical analysis of nutrients, expressions of peroxidation,&#xD;
      expressions of DNA damage, proteomics and metabolomics of spinal fluid, blood and urine,&#xD;
      microarray analysis of different nutritional deficiency subgroups, together with the routine&#xD;
      diagnostics investigations undertaken at the memory clinic, and a nutritional assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients and the healthy controls will only receive information about results of&#xD;
      examinations that are part of the routine investigation at the memory clinic, this according&#xD;
      to the Norwegian Biotechnology Law and the permission from the National Committees for&#xD;
      Research Ethics in Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the vitamins listed as primary outcomes, the following measurements will be&#xD;
      carried through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Isoprostane measurements: The findings of F2-α-isoprostane-increase in cerebrospinal&#xD;
           fluid close to the diseased organ, and not in the plasma, makes it important to confirm&#xD;
           these findings. Isoprostane measurement in CNS might become an important parameter in&#xD;
           prospective treatment studies where the actual treatment at least should normalize the&#xD;
           pathological finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 8 hydroxy-2-deoxy guanosine increase in cerebrospinal fluid or urine, reveals DNA-damage&#xD;
           suggesting further mechanisms for the AD development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Spinal fluid: Nutrients in spinal fluid, expressions of increased peroxidation like&#xD;
           F2-α-isoprostane, tau proteins and possibly with LC/MS methodology metabolic pattern&#xD;
           (metabolomics) and different proteins (proteomics).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proteomics; determination of protein profiles. The emerging technology of mass&#xD;
                spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics provides a powerful tool to&#xD;
                systematically and quantitatively assess quantitative differences in protein&#xD;
                profiles. Discovery based proteomics compares the proteome of a diseased sample&#xD;
                versus normal at a global scale, and has been widely applied to study various human&#xD;
                diseases with the goal of identifying biomarkers and/or reveal the pathogenesis of&#xD;
                diseases. In this study, protein samples from control and diseased will be labeled&#xD;
                with different stable isotopes, digested to peptides and analyzed by LCMS.&#xD;
                Quantitative differences of the proteins from these groups will be performed by&#xD;
                state-of-the-art hybrid mass spectrometer, LTQ XL-Orbitrap. The Orbitrap instrument&#xD;
                has extremely high resolving power, mass accuracy and sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Metabonomics: Metabonomics aims at measuring and mathematically modeling changes in&#xD;
                the metabolite concentrations found in biological fluids and tissues. Nuclear&#xD;
                magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy allows the detection and quantification of&#xD;
                compounds in large mixtures, such as the products of metabolism in biological&#xD;
                fluids and tissues. There are hundreds of such metabolites to be found in&#xD;
                cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, serum and urine. NMR spectroscopy offers the advantage&#xD;
                of measuring their concentrations with micromolar sensitivity while conveniently&#xD;
                requiring only little sample preparation. In recent studies involving large sets of&#xD;
                spectra, the variation of results was shown to be as small as 2 % reflecting a high&#xD;
                degree of reproducibility. By identifying patterns in the metabolic fingerprint of&#xD;
                the organism, one can study the effects of diet, drugs and disease using&#xD;
                multivariate statistics such as principal component analysis and partial least&#xD;
                squares attempts to interpret NMR spectra.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Genetic analyses: m-RNA measurement with SNP-profiles for&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DNA repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Active components in processing av APP and Abeta.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Will include if possible, sequencing of genome and/or GWAS.&#xD;
