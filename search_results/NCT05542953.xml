    <measure>Assessment of [18F]APN-1607 Uptake Patterns by Regional SUVR Values</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Regional [18F]APN-1607 uptake patterns will be assessed in regions of interest (ROIs) and an iROI that are relevant to AD pathology. [18F]APN-1607 uptake patterns identified by regional analysis will be compared among healthy subjects, subjects with MDAD, and subjects with AD dementia. Standard uptake value (SUV) will be calculated for each ROI, and SUVRs will be calculated by normalizing SUV of ROIs to the SUV of relevant reference region.</description>

For the injection, subjects will receive a target dose of 5-7 mCi IV as a bolus injection. [18F]APN-1607 injection will be followed by a 10 ml saline flush.</description>
