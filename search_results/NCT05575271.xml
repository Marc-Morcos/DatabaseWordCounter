    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled clinical study will be conducted in Xuanwu Hospital of Capital&#xD;
      Medical University. This study initially explore the effect of selective vagus nerve(C fiber)&#xD;
      stimulation on mild-to-moderate AD patients, in order to regulate the activity of the locus&#xD;
      coeruleus-norepinephrine network, and to observe the improvement of cognitive function and&#xD;
      memory function. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive selective&#xD;
      vagus nerve stimulation in the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD patients, to clarify the&#xD;
      effective mechanism, and to provide an effective clinical treatment strategy.&#xD;

      This project plans to recruit 6 patients with Mild-Moderate Alzheimer's disease. They were&#xD;
      randomly divided into vagus nerve active stimulation group and sham stimulation group, to&#xD;
      receive vagus nerve stimulator implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 weeks after implantation, the active group will start the treatment for 12 weeks, and the&#xD;
      stimulator of the shame group will be turned off for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment, cognitive assessment, head MRI and PET examination of norepinephrine&#xD;
      distribution were completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects and adverse events were assessed at 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks, and&#xD;
      cognitive assessment, head MRI and PET examination of norepinephrine distribution was also&#xD;
      performed at the 14th week, Then, the true stimulation group continued to be turned on for 12&#xD;
      weeks, and the sham group turned on the stimulator to start the treatment for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      cognitive assessment, head MRI and PET examination of norepinephrine distribution were also&#xD;
      performed at 26 weeks.&#xD;

It is broken down into 7 different stages. Stages 1-3 are the pre-dementia stages. Stages 4-7 are the dementia stages. Biginning in stage 5, an individual can no longer survive without assistance.</description>
