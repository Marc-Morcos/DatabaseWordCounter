    <textblock>
      Sodium Oligomannate Capsules (GV-971) has been approved for treatment of mild to moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and improving the cognitive function of patients. This study plans to&#xD;
      observe, in the clinical patients, the long-term efficacy and safety of GV-971, as well as&#xD;
      the changes in blood and gut microbiota biomarkers after treatment, to validate the mechanism&#xD;
      of action of GV-971, in order to better guide the rational use of drug in clinical practice.&#xD;
