    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop and evaluate new in-home supportive technology that is designed to&#xD;
      alleviate anxiety, burden, and loneliness in spousal and familial caregivers of individuals&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or mild cognitive impairment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop, refine, and evaluate a new hardware/software system designed to&#xD;
      integrate in-home sensors and devices, Internet-of-Things technologies (i.e., devices that&#xD;
      can be controlled and communicated with via the internet), and social networking to create a&#xD;
      more safe and supportive home environment for caregivers and people who have Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, other dementias, or mild cognitive impairment. The system monitors troublesome&#xD;
      behaviors in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (e.g., wandering), and targets&#xD;
      mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in people with&#xD;
      dementia or mild cognitive impairment with adverse caregiver outcomes (declines in health and&#xD;
      well-being). The system is designed to minimize demands on caregivers' limited time and&#xD;
      energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care&#xD;
      professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Caregivers in the full operation condition will have fewer negative effects of&#xD;
           caregiving (lower burden, better mental and physical health, higher well-being) than&#xD;
           those in the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Greater use of the social networking features of the system will be associated with&#xD;
           fewer caregiver depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Greater utilization of the home safety features of the system will be associated with&#xD;
           fewer caregiver anxiety symptoms.&#xD;

            <description>Participants (N=300) will receive and install the full system (sensors for entry, activity, temperature, water leak; voice control; digital display; local router) in their homes. Remote assistance will be provided to help with the installation. Sensors, warnings, messaging, and social networking features will be activated remotely. Participation will extend over a six month period with questionnaires (e.g., health and well-being) administered 3 times (at the time of installation and every 3 months thereafter).&#xD;
In-Home Technology System and Questionnaires: Participants self-install the in-home technology system in their homes after enrollment in the study (i.e., consent procedures and initial questionnaire). Intelligent bots monitor the in-home sensors, learn typical patterns, and provide caregivers with text messages via cell phone and alerts via the tablet when worrisome behaviors occur. Social contact is encouraged using caregiver resources and a trusted circle of friends and family who are encouraged to stay in contact with the caregiver and person with dementia or mild cognitive impairment.</description>

            <description>Participants (N=300) will receive and install the full system (sensors for entry, activity, temperature, water leak; voice control; digital display; local router) in their homes. Remote assistance will be provided to help with the installation. Sensors, warnings, messaging, and social networking features will be activated remotely. Participation will extend over a six month period with questionnaires (e.g., health and well-being) administered 3 times (at the time of installation and every 3 months thereafter).&#xD;
In-Home Technology System and Questionnaires: Participants self-install the in-home technology system in their homes after enrollment in the study (i.e., consent procedures and initial questionnaire). Intelligent bots monitor the in-home sensors, learn typical patterns, and provide caregivers with text messages via cell phone and alerts via the tablet when worrisome behaviors occur. Social contact is encouraged using caregiver resources and a trusted circle of friends and family who are encouraged to stay in contact with the caregiver and person with dementia or mild cognitive impairment.</description>

Waiting Control In-Home Technology System and Questionnaires: Participants self-install the in-home technology system in their homes six months after their enrollment in the study (i.e., consent procedures and initial questionnaire). Intelligent bots monitor the in-home sensors, learn typical patterns, and provide caregivers with text messages via cell phone and alerts via the tablet when worrisome behaviors occur. Social contact is encouraged using caregiver resources and a trusted circle of friends and family who are encouraged to stay in contact with the caregiver and person with dementia or mild cognitive impairment.</description>

          <title>6 Months Assessment for Satisfaction With Life Scale</title>
          <description>Questionnaire measuring overall life satisfaction and well-being (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &amp; Griffin, 1985). 5 items scored on a 1-7 scale and summed (Range = 5-35). Lower scores indicate worse outcomes. A score of 20 is considered neutral with higher scores considered increasingly more satisfied and lower scores considered increasingly more dissatisfied.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The study intended to recruit 400 participants, however at the start of enrollment, COVID-19 shutdowns occurred and caregivers were less likely to enroll in the study because they were at home (i.e., not out in public) more often, thus not needing to remotely monitor the individuals that they were providing care for. Thus the final number of installations was 216. Due to selective attrition the final active control ratio was approximately 2:1.</limitations_and_caveats>
