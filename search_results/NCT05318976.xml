    <measure>Change in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline to Week 24 in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)&#xD;
The CDR scale is a clinician-rated dementia staging system that tracks the progression of cognitive impairment in 6 categories (memory, orientation, judgement, and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care). Each category is scored on a 5-point scale in which None = 0, Questionable = 0.5, Mild = 1, Moderate = 2, and Severe = 3. The global CDR score is established by clinical scoring rules and has values of 0 (no dementia), 0.5, (questionable dementia), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), and 3 (severe dementia). The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) is obtained by adding the ratings in each of the 6 categories and ranges from 0 to 18 with higher scores indicative of greater impairment.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Goal Attainment Scale (GAS)</measure>

    <description>Change in individual goals based on the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS)&#xD;
The achievement of each goal is rated on a 5-point attainment scale (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2) to allow standardized scoring of personalized outcomes. A participant's overall goal attainment is quantified using a formula that takes into account the number of goals that have been set, and the extent to which they are correlated with each other. For each identified goal area, the caregiver will be asked to give a detailed description of the patient's current (baseline) status and goal status, which will be recorded at the -1 and 0 levels on the 5-point scale, respectively. The remaining levels of the scale will then be set: somewhat better than the goal (+1), much better than the goal (+2), and much worse than the goal (-2).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Seated blood pressure of ≥ 165/105 mmHg at Screening.&#xD;
