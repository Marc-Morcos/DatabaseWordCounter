  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to perform a multimodal characterization of brain structural&#xD;
      and functional changes, as well as changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, as a&#xD;
      function of sleep quality measures. Cross-sectional data will enable us to confirm and expand&#xD;
      previous knowledge in a large and well-phenotyped population, while longitudinal data will&#xD;
      allow us to test the hypothesis of the existence of a bidirectional relationship between&#xD;
      sleep quality and AD.&#xD;

        A total of 200 participants from the BBRC ALFA+ study (ALFA - FPM - 0311) will be selected&#xD;
        based on their core AD biomarker profile to characterize their sleep quality with objective&#xD;
        (actigraphy and RUSleeping RTS) and subjective measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be classified into two different groups, based on previously established&#xD;
        CSF biomarkers cut off values, as follows: 1) Controls: individuals with CSF Aβ42/ Aβ40&#xD;
        ratio &gt; 0.071 ng/mL (considered as without altered AD biomarkers). 2) Preclinical AD:&#xD;
        individuals with CSF Aβ42/ Aβ40 ratio 0.071 ≤ ng/mL (considered as with evidence of brain&#xD;
        amyloidosis). However, it must be noted that thresholds for core biomarker abnormalities in&#xD;
        preclinical AD, is an ongoing field of research and that these thresholds may vary with the&#xD;
        addition of novel data/evidence resulting from our group and others.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects that are currently participating in the ALFA+ study (cognitively healthy&#xD;
             adults aged between 45-65 years at the moment of the inclusion in the 45-65/FPM2012&#xD;
             study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects from whom CSF and/or neuroimaging biomarkers have been acquired during the&#xD;
             last 36 months prior to their enrollment in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of clinically relevant neurological disorder, psychiatric disorder or other&#xD;
             medical conditions that may jeopardize the interpretation of the study results&#xD;
             according to the investigator criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the PSG sub-study, participants currently treated with drugs that may interfere in&#xD;
             PSG data interpretation (e.g. antidepressants or benzodiazepines).&#xD;
