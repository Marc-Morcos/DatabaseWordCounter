      This study is designed as a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized&#xD;
      parallel-group study that will be completed at the clinical research facility at St. James'&#xD;
      Hospital and at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. A total of 100 amnestic mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (aMCI) patients will receive a (real or control) non-invasive transcutaneous&#xD;
      electrical stimulation procedure. Patients will be assigned to one of four groups. One group&#xD;
      will receive active stimulation, while the three groups will be control groups. One groups&#xD;
      will be receive sham stimulation (inactive control), while a second group will receive active&#xD;
      stimulation and local anesthesia and a third group will stimulate a different nerve (active&#xD;
      control; same sensation different nerve). The investigators will include three control groups&#xD;
      to verify that the effect is real and location specific and cannot be associated to a&#xD;
      sensation effect. The investigators have opted to use a parallel-group design as it is&#xD;
      unclear what the carry-over effect and/or wash-out period will be for stimulation. To&#xD;
      eliminate subjective bias, all patients and the investigator testing the endpoint measures&#xD;
      will be blinded to the type of intervention. The primary outcome, i.e. memory recall, will be&#xD;
      determined by a word association task recorded immediately after stimulation, 7 days after&#xD;
      stimulation, and 28 days after stimulation. The secondary outcomes is neurophysiological&#xD;
      changes determined by resting state EEG, which will be assessed immediately before and after&#xD;
      stimulation in the first session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct this study as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening aMCI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomly assigning aMCI patients to one of the four groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Administering one session active stimulation (n = 25) or control (n = 25 in each of&#xD;
           three control group) stimulation paired with a word-association task; administered by&#xD;
           research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Behavioral assessments after each of the three blocks of studying the word associations&#xD;
           and neural measures immediately after the last session of Behavioral assessments (T0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Behavioral assessments at seven (T1) and 28 (T2) days after stimulation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients 50 years of age and above with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), will be&#xD;
      recruited to the memory clinic at St. James and the Memory Assessment and Support Service&#xD;
      Tallaght University Hospital. The investigators plan to include 100 English-speaking aMCI&#xD;
      patients. To participate in this study, subjects should be able to provide an informed&#xD;
      consent, have a confirmed aMCI diagnosis and have their medication stable for at least three&#xD;
      months prior to baseline data collection. Prospective participants, who meet the criteria,&#xD;
      will be sent an electronic copy of the consent form. Participants will only be asked to sign&#xD;
      the consent form at the site after going over the form with the researcher where all aspects&#xD;
      of the study protocol will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to give us adequate power to detect clinically meaningful differences&#xD;
      between the groups. Twenty individuals per group (total n = 80) would offer us a power of 80%&#xD;
      to detect the difference between groups using Cohen's d estimation of effect size. A sample&#xD;
      size of 80 will allow us to see a large effect size. Although The investigators do not expect&#xD;
      attrition to be large, a dropout rate of no more than 10% is expected. This trial is&#xD;
      longitudinal which could increase its drop-out rate. The investigators will thus oversample&#xD;
      to a target sample size of 25 patients per group to assure that our power to detect effects&#xD;
      is maintained. The overall sample will be 100. The investigators aim to recruit patients with&#xD;
      aMCI and display pre-symptomatic signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD). An age ranging from 50&#xD;
      years and above is a good fit for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of three in person sessions. Session 1 will consist of a word association&#xD;
      memory task in which participants are instructed to memorize a subset of words. Participants&#xD;
      will either receive active stimulation or control stimulation during the word-association&#xD;
      task. Session 1 will also include demographic and mood related questionnaires, as well as EEG&#xD;
      before and after memory testing. At the end of EEG testing, participants will fill out an&#xD;
      exit questionnaire developed by Brunoni et al. to assess potential side-effects (headache,&#xD;
      neck pain, scalp pain, tingling, itching, burning sensation, skin redness, sleepiness,&#xD;
      trouble concentrating, mood changes) at the end of stimulation. One week after Session 1,&#xD;
      Session 2 will take place. They will again complete the word association memory task. Three&#xD;
      weeks after Session 2, Session 3 will take place and participants will complete the word&#xD;
      association memory task and complete a blinding questionnaire at the end of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During memory testing, participants will receive one of four interventions. Participants will&#xD;
      encounter a second researcher who will take over for the first researcher in order to provide&#xD;
      the blinded-stimulation protocol. They will be assigned randomly (like a flip of a coin) to&#xD;
      one of four groups. Some groups will receive active stimulation and the other three groups&#xD;
      will serve as controls. For sham stimulation, placement of the electrodes will be identical&#xD;
      to active stimulation. A third group will receive stimulation, but with a topical skin&#xD;
      anesthetic. For the fourth control group, the electrodes will be placed on the lower neck.&#xD;
      For both the third and fourth control group, the current similar to active stimulation will&#xD;
      be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be paid at the end of the session and will be asked to sign a receipt of&#xD;
      the money. If they successfully complete the study, they will be compensated for travel with&#xD;
      10 euros, if they wish to withdraw or are unable to proceed because of any in-eligibility in&#xD;
      the in-person session, they will be compensated with 5 euros for travel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be managed using unique study codes, which will be used to code and file all&#xD;
      electronic information, to protect participant confidentiality. To ensure privacy, all&#xD;
      research files (e.g. screening, consent, questionnaires) will be stored in locked file&#xD;
      cabinets in locked offices at Trinity. Electronic information (e.g. EEG and behavioral data)&#xD;
      will be stored at a secure, password-protected, server at Trinity and all corresponding data&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted at Trinity to ensure central and complete data protection. Subject&#xD;
      names will not be published. Summary statistics will be performed on all variables and&#xD;
      reported. The person processing the data will not be able to trace back the data to the&#xD;
      individual. Data will contain a pseudonymised subject code and thus be de-identified.&#xD;
      Pseudonymised data will be stored for 7 years as required by GDPR rules. After this personal&#xD;
      and raw data will be deleted and the data will be anonymised. The processed data and group&#xD;
      analysis will stored be indefinitely and will be shared through Trinity TARA Open Access&#xD;
      database to promote Open Science. The key codes linking the participant names to the&#xD;
      pseudonymised data will be stored in a secure Excel file in a secure USB by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis will be performed. For the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      analysis, the patient must successfully complete T0 and T1 assessments. For missing&#xD;
      observations, the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach will be used. Exclusion&#xD;
      from the population will be finalized prior to database lock in a blinded manner. Memory&#xD;
      recall during the word-association task will be assessed to determine memory performance. For&#xD;
      EEG data, sLORETA statistical contrast maps will be calculated for the sham and active groups&#xD;
      through multiple voxel-by-voxel comparisons in a logarithm of F-ratio. For transcutaneous&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (TES) adverse events, a comparison will be conducted between the&#xD;
      active and sham group using a one-way ANOVA with stimulation (active vs sham) as independent&#xD;
      variable and adverse events as dependent variable. A Chi-square test will be conducted&#xD;
      comparing actual stimulation (active vs sham) versus participants' expected stimulation&#xD;
      (active vs sham) to determine if subjects were blinded to the experimental condition.&#xD;
