    <textblock>
      General Hypothesis: hypothesize that A / A symptoms of AD follow a particular course,&#xD;
      influenced by associated factors, and a prospective longitudinal observational study&#xD;
      specifically evaluating A / A symptoms in patients with MA, living in an institution and at&#xD;
      home, would provide useful data for both clinical practice and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Hypothesis: hypothesize that in patients with AD with clinically significant A / A&#xD;
      there is a correlation between assessment of A / A severity based on specific scales of A / A&#xD;
      and overall impression assessment of clinical improvement or worsening of these symptoms by&#xD;
      the clinician.&#xD;

    <measure>Severity of A/A with NeuroPsychiatric Inventory Clinician (NPI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between enrollment and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of the A / A will be evaluated using the scale:&#xD;
NeuroPsychiatric Inventory Clinician (NPI-C): combined score of 2 domains agitation and aggression (from Medeiros, 2010).&#xD;
The purpose of the NPI-C is to collect information on the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with cerebral pathologies.&#xD;
The rating of all the behavioral domains of the NPI-C scale (C for Clinician) also makes it possible to measure the scores of the other symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The clinical relevance of the change observed by the clinician with Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between enrollment and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical relevance of the change observed by the clinician will be based on the A / A-specific section of the modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) (Drye et al, 2012).&#xD;
The ADCS-CGIC was developed to evaluate the clinical significance of the evolutions observed in therapeutic trials on Alzheimer's disease, and is based on the measured changes compared to the initial evaluation. The modified version, mADCS-CGIC, evaluates the clinical relevance of a treatment based on the measurement of changes assessed by a clinician. The assessment is performed by a trained clinician at the scale</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between enrollment and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The original version contains 29 items and contains verbal aggression, physical items and items not related to aggression. The rating of items is done on the occurrence of the frequency of disorders in the previous two weeks on a scale of 0 to 7.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life QoL-AD</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between enrollment and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life for patients and caregivers will be based on the QoL-AD scale at V0, V3, V6 and V12.&#xD;
Quantitative variable, therefore this evaluation criterion will be expressed as an average. The passing of the scale lasts approximately 5 minutes. This scale will be evaluated by a TEC : The QOL-AD is administered in interview format to individuals with question the quality of life for Alzheimer's patients</description>

    <description>The investigation aims to study the natural evolution of type A / A SPCDs in patients with AD. In this study, patients will receive optimized management based on existing best practice recommendations (HAS Recommendations 2009). It will therefore be a standard care study, since this survey applies the current recommendations on tools for the evaluation of SPCDs and the management of behavioral disorders in Alzheimer's disease (Recommendations HAS 2009).</description>
