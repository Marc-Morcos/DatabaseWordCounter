  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has been shown to be beneficial for the brain. The investigators would like to test&#xD;
      this specifically for those diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. This study will involve 30&#xD;
      randomized patients to take part in the out-patient exercise program and 30 patients to&#xD;
      continue with their regular activities over a 6-month period. Once that period is over, half&#xD;
      of the 30 patients who participated in the outpatient exercise program will continue in the&#xD;
      program and the other half will be randomized to independently continue to exercise. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that exercising will benefit the patient by slowing the dementia&#xD;
      process, improving behavioral symptoms, and decreasing volume loss of certain brain regions.&#xD;
      Each person will perform personalized exercise regimens, MR imaging and neuropsychological&#xD;
      tests will be used to measure the benefits of exercise. Ultimately, the hope is that the&#xD;
      results of this study could be used to facilitate exercise programs for patients. Enrollment&#xD;
      is completely voluntary and all personal data obtained will remain confidential.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria for patients will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease as per 2011 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Mild or moderate stage of dementia, a score of 10-25 in the Clinical dementia rating&#xD;
             score (CDR) &lt;2 and a score of 10-25 (inclusive) on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
             (MoCA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age 60 to 95 inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Mobility, preserved vision and hearing (eyeglasses and/or hearing aid are permissible)&#xD;
             sufficient for compliance with testing procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to tolerate and perform aerobic exercise program (as per The Canadian Society&#xD;
             for Exercise Physiology; all patients above the age of 69 embarking on a new exercise&#xD;
             routine should have the &quot;Physical Activity Readiness Medical Examination&quot; (PARmed-X)&#xD;
             form completed by their family physician. All patients being asked to enroll in the&#xD;
             study will have their PCPs fill out this form to ensure the patient is able to&#xD;
             withstand the exercise program. If they are being followed by a cardiologist, they&#xD;
             fill out the form)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence of a respective caregiver&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability to tolerate MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability to speak and understand the English language (as questionnaires and tests are&#xD;
             only available in English)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for the caregivers will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Being the primary caregiver for a given patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ability to speak and understand English (as questionnaires and tests are only&#xD;
             available in English)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. MoCA score â‰¥ 26&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for Patients and Caregivers:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of another neurological disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Psychiatric disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severe aphasia (semantic word loss)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Visual deficits requiring correction beyond the use of eyeglasses or contact lenses&#xD;
             (intact visual acuity is required for completing both the questionnaires and the&#xD;
             emotion evaluation test which consists of video vignettes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Hearing problems requiring correction beyond hearing aids (videos have an auditory&#xD;
             component)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of pacemakers, aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ear implants, metal&#xD;
             pieces or objects in the eyes, skin or body will be excluded as they will be unable to&#xD;
             have a MRI scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability to tolerate or perform aerobic exercise as declared by family physician on&#xD;
             PARmed-X form&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Significant vascular disease seen on MRI (Fazekas score&gt;2)&#xD;
