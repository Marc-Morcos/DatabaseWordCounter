  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 70 % of people with dementia suffer from severe psychological distress that decreases&#xD;
      their quality of life and that of their caregivers. A vicious circle can easily install&#xD;
      between the person with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and her caregiver: the distress expressed by&#xD;
      the person with AD increases burden of the caregiver who ends with distress, which in turn&#xD;
      intensifies the distress of the person with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to disrupting the quality of life of people, psychological distress can also&#xD;
      accelerate cognitive decline, caused by an increase in memory and attention problems. For all&#xD;
      those reasons, it is indispensable to treat psychological distress in people with AD and&#xD;
      their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to test the feasibility and efficacy of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      especially designed to reduce psychological distress and improve quality of life of people&#xD;
      with AD and their caregivers and, possibly, to slow down cognitive decline.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large percentage of people with dementia (including Alzheimer's disease) suffer from&#xD;
      psychological distress characterized by severe symptoms of anxiety, depression or insomnia.&#xD;
      This psychological distress can disrupt their daily functioning and deteriorate their quality&#xD;
      of life. The presence of anxiety, depression or insomnia can also accelerate cognitive&#xD;
      decline in people with AD. Moreover, the psychological distress experienced by people with AD&#xD;
      can have significant repercussions on their relatives. Effectively, up to 75 % of caregivers&#xD;
      say they suffer from psychological distress due to the burden associated with their new role.&#xD;
      The optimal treatment must therefore target the psychological distress experienced by people&#xD;
      having AD and by their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the psychological treatment of choice to treat anxiety,&#xD;
      depression and insomnia in older people without cognitive impairment. However, few data are&#xD;
      available to draw the same conclusions for people with dementia. In fact, only about ten&#xD;
      studies on the subject have been published and many of them have poor methodological quality.&#xD;
      The main methodological limitations identified in these studies are: 1) the lack of cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral strategies treating simultaneously anxiety, depression and insomnia, three of the&#xD;
      main symptoms of psychological distress; 2) the absence of active control groups and; 3) the&#xD;
      absence of follow-ups exceeding 6 months. The current study will fill all these gaps by&#xD;
      testing a new CBT named Programme de Bien-Être Psychologique (PEP) especially designed to&#xD;
      improve the quality of life of people with AD and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CBT will include 8 weekly group sessions of 120 minutes each. The first hour will be&#xD;
      carried out in two simultaneous groups led each of them by a psychologist: a group of AD&#xD;
      participants and a group of caregivers. The second half of the session will combine all the&#xD;
      participants in one group and will be led by both psychologists. Each session will focus on&#xD;
      the implementation of pleasant activities aimed at reducing psychological distress and&#xD;
      improve the quality of life. Indeed, the loss of pleasant activities has been shown to be a&#xD;
      leading cause of psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, etc.) in people with&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. Moreover, the content of the sessions will be adapted to the&#xD;
      characteristics of people with AD. In particular, emotions management strategies (e.g.&#xD;
      abdominal breathing) will be simplified to ensure proper understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CBT group will be compared to a non-directive support group. This active control group&#xD;
      was developed in a similar format as the CBT group (in terms of the number of sessions,&#xD;
      duration, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The first objective is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of the Programme de&#xD;
      Bien-Être Psychologique (PEP). It is expected that the PEP will have significantly more&#xD;
      effect on psychological distress, level of functioning and participants' quality of life&#xD;
      between pre and post intervention than the non-directive support group. It also hypothesized&#xD;
      that participants assigned to the PEP intervention will be significantly more likely to&#xD;
      maintain their progress at 6 and 12-month follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to test if the PEP intervention can slow down cognitive decline in&#xD;
      participants with AD. It is expected that the intervention will be significantly more&#xD;
      effective in slowing cognitive decline between pre-test and follow-ups compared to the&#xD;
      non-directive support group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last objective is to survey the participants' opinion after the treatment to deepen the&#xD;
      quantitative results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: 30 dyads of French-speaking participants will be recruited in Montreal from the&#xD;
      cognition clinic of the IUGM, in the CRIUGM participants' database and among a number of&#xD;
      community organizations working with seniors and caregivers. In addition, ads will be&#xD;
      published in newsletters sent by local community organizations to their membership base, as&#xD;
      well as ads placed in newspapers or magazines destined to the elderly population. Dyads&#xD;
      wishing to participate will have to contact the research coordinator or will be contacted if&#xD;
      consent has been given. In both cases, a phone interview will determine the eligibility of&#xD;
      the dyads to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible dyads will be then invited to complete the pretest. It will begin with a physician's&#xD;
      assessment to confirm the diagnosis of AD and assess its severity with the Clinical Dementia&#xD;
      Rating (CDR). In addition, the physician will assess the level of self-criticism of the&#xD;
      person with AD to ensure that he/she is aware of his/her memory losses (see inclusion&#xD;
      criteria). After, questionnaires assessing psychological health and quality of life will be&#xD;
      administered to participants with AD and their caregivers (on an individual basis) by two&#xD;
      students in psychology. A second assessment session will be taken in charge by a doctoral&#xD;
      student in neuropsychology who will evaluate the cognitive status of people with AD using&#xD;
      different neuropsychological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the two assessment sessions, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      the PEP intervention (i.e. experimental group) or the non-directive support group (i.e.&#xD;
      control group). They will be matched by gender, age, level of self-criticism, clinical&#xD;
      dementia rating (CDR) scores, and intensity of psychological distress (K10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the exception of the physician's assessment, psychological and neuropsychological&#xD;
      questionnaires will be administered again at post-intervention (T2) and at 6 (T3) and 12&#xD;
      months (T4) follow-ups. Moreover, booster sessions will be scheduled 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      the intervention. Finally, all dyads will be contacted monthly by phone during the year&#xD;
      following the intervention. These follow-ups will be done to help reduce the attrition rate&#xD;
      and to maintain therapeutic gains. All participants will be enrolled in the study for a&#xD;
      period of 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention: The CBT intervention (i.e., PEP group) is a modified version of one&#xD;
      previously developed by Grenier and Ouellet for participants having mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (MCI).This intervention has been manualized. Basically, the intervention will include&#xD;
      behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and stress/anger management strategies (e.g.&#xD;
      abdominal breathing, progressive muscle relaxation). In addition, knowledge about memory&#xD;
      management and sleep disorders will be provided. The components of CBT will be adapted to&#xD;
      people with AD by including easy instructions, repetition of information during and between&#xD;
      sessions, visual support, practice during sessions and a comprehensive summary of each&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-directive support group: This intervention will provide time and space to discuss the&#xD;
      impact of AD. The objective will be to help participants feel less alone and better&#xD;
      understood and to address the implications of AD in their daily life. The animators will&#xD;
      facilitate the exchange of opinions and encourage discussions through questions or&#xD;
      suggestions without teaching CBT strategies.&#xD;
