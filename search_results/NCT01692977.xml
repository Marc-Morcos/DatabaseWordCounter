  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disruption of spatial orientation is considered the second most common cognitive symptom&#xD;
      of dementia, affecting nearly all activities of daily living. Research in the field of&#xD;
      environmental psychology has helped to highlight the influence of the environment on patients&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's disease or related syndromes. With regard to spatial orientation, it has&#xD;
      been shown that an environment can provide support for cognitive failures in subjects if that&#xD;
      particular space is adapted. While numerous studies have focused on the architectural&#xD;
      environment (hospital, housing facility), none have explored the ability of patients to&#xD;
      orient themselves in a natural environment such as a garden. Yet, in recent years, such&#xD;
      gardens, known as healing gardens, have emerged in housing and care facilities, providing&#xD;
      genuine support for the care management of patients with Alzheimer-type dementia. Various&#xD;
      works have been published outlining recommendations for their management. However, with&#xD;
      regard to spatial orientation, none of the available research has explored the basic&#xD;
      principles on which to rely on in order to organize the elements of outdoor spaces into&#xD;
      itineraries that promote orientation, according to ZEISEL and TYSON (1999). In the absence of&#xD;
      such data, these authors recommend relying on five elements, identified by Lynch in his&#xD;
      landmark book &quot;Image of the City&quot; (1960), that people use to orient themselves and find their&#xD;
      way. These are &quot; paths &quot;, &quot; edges &quot;, &quot; districts &quot;, &quot; nodes &quot; and &quot; landmarks &quot;. The&#xD;
      hypothesis to verify is that patients with Alzheimer's disease do not rely on the same&#xD;
      elements of the garden as non-Alzheimer's subjects in making orientation decisions and to&#xD;
      mentally picture this environment.&#xD;
