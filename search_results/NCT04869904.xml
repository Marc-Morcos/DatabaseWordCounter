  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The neurological disorders that accompany aging represent a major public health problem. The&#xD;
      management of these diseases is a major medical and social priority. This project is based on&#xD;
      the assumption that the oral cavity represents a privileged observation space to address&#xD;
      these issues. The mouth is a site of easy access for painless sampling; there is therefore a&#xD;
      major interest in identifying early oral infectious markers of the development or evolution&#xD;
      of senile dementia. In addition to the interest of an early oral diagnosis, the mapping of&#xD;
      the oral microbial flora in the demented elderly would allow a better understanding,&#xD;
      prevention or even control of the evolution of neurodegenerative diseases. The final&#xD;
      objective of our approach is to characterize the oral pathogens, or more probably the group&#xD;
      of oral pathogens, which are significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
