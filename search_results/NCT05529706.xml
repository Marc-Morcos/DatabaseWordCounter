    <textblock>
      This is a validation study to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the Brain Health Program, a multimodal curriculum covering dementia risk factors&#xD;
      and evidence-based change interventions. The goal of this study is to evaluate the Brain&#xD;
      Health Program in individuals with identified risk factors for the onset of dementia and to&#xD;
      prepare for a large-scale efficacy trial in this population.&#xD;

      This study will employ an evidence-based Brain Health Program curriculum, which involves a&#xD;
      twelve-week, group-administered, personalized program designed to improve brain health in&#xD;
      individuals with identified risk factors for the onset of dementia. This is a single-arm&#xD;
      open-label feasibility study, enrolling older adults with Alzheimer's disease risk factors in&#xD;
      a public health, community-deployed, group-based and individualized multimodal Brain Health&#xD;
      Program (targeting, among other domains, diet, exercise and cognitive exercise), with a set&#xD;
      of baseline assessments intended to characterize the population, and outcome measure to&#xD;
      evaluate the usability of the program, as well as preliminary efficacy to reduce dementia&#xD;
      risk factors.&#xD;

    <description>The scoring for this answer is based on a 0 to 10 scale. Those who respond with a score of 9 to 10 are called Promoters, and are considered likely to exhibit value-creating behaviors, such as making more positive referrals to other potential program participants. Those who respond with a score of 0 to 6 are labeled Detractors, and they are believed to be less likely to exhibit the value-creating behaviors. Responses of 7 and 8 are labeled Passives, and their behavior falls between Promoters and Detractors. The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are Detractors from the percentage of customers who are Promoters. For purposes of calculating a Net Promoter Score, Passives count toward the total number of respondents, thus decreasing the percentage of detractors and promoters and pushing the net score toward 0.</description>

    <description>The Brain Health Program employs 2-hour group-based training and education regarding modifiable Alzheimer's disease dementia risk factors delivered over a 12-week period. Participants will be assigned into a group of n=20, and participants will engage the Brain Health Program collaboratively, as administered by the program content leader (instructor), while also being monitored and supported by the tech leader (in accordance with the Diabetes Prevention Program model).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants who are 65 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants who meet criteria for two or more Alzheimer's Disease and related&#xD;
             dementia risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Family history of Alzheimer's dementia (1st degree relative)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Genetic marker (APOE4++)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subjective or objective cognitive decline (neuropsychological testing; or self-&#xD;
                  reported &quot;yes&quot; to the following question: &quot;In the past two years, have you&#xD;
                  experienced a decline in your memory or thinking?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Poorly controlled hypertension or diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Physical inactivity &lt;150min/week per Surgeon General guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Social isolation, in which participant rarely or never gets social and emotional&#xD;
                  support when needed&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. OR, meet criteria for elevated risk factors, as determined via the Australian&#xD;
                  National University AD Risk Index (ANU-ADRI) assessment instrument, a&#xD;
                  questionnaire-based measure that assess fixed and modifiable risk factors for&#xD;
                  dementia. The ANU-ADRI has been used in multi-modal studies of behavioral change&#xD;
                  interventions to reduce dementia risk, and scores have been shown to predict the&#xD;
                  transition from healthy aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) - a crucial&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Participants enrolled in a concurrent clinical trial involving an investigational&#xD;
             pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, medical device, or behavioral treatment that could&#xD;
