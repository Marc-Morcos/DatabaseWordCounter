      This is a bridging study to visually and quantitatively assess PET images obtained after&#xD;
      single application of 300 MBq [18F]florbetaben and PET scanning of patients with healthy&#xD;
      subjects and non-cognitively impaired subjects or mild to moderate Alzheimer disease&#xD;
      subjects. The diagnostic efficacy of the visual and quantitative assessments of 18FBB PET&#xD;
      images for diagnosis of Alzheimer disease will be determined by comparison to the standard of&#xD;
      truth (SoT) obtained through standard of care clinical diagnosis. Imaging results were&#xD;
      compared with reference standards to assess the ability of 18FBB PET imaging to differentiate&#xD;
      non-cognitively impaired subjects from mild to moderate AD subjects. To investigate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of healthy subjects after single intravenous administration&#xD;
      of 18FBB in Chinese population. Verify the safety of subjects after a single intravenous&#xD;
      administration of 18FBB in Chinese population.&#xD;
