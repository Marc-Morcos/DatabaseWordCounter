      This study will ascertain whether nicotine is safe and tolerable in DS patients, help with&#xD;
      dose-ranging of nicotine in DS, look for evidence of enhancements in cognitive functioning,&#xD;
      and establish evidence for biological and behavioral correlates of nicotinic stimulation&#xD;
      effects. The knowledge gained from the translational aspects of this project may also guide&#xD;
      the application of new nicotinic drugs in DS and generate, for the first time, data on the&#xD;
      importance of nicotinic receptor changes in the development of cognitive impairment in DS&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transdermal nicotine treatment will be well tolerated out to one month by non-smoking DS&#xD;
           patients without significant adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nicotine will enhance cognitive performance by one month compared to baseline and&#xD;
           post-treatment testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nicotine will enhance functioning detectable by clinician and/or informant ratings&#xD;
           (pre-post).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 50% of adults with Down Syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the age of 60&#xD;
      (Nadel 2003), and life expectancy in DS is now 50-60 years. Thus, age-associated cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and dementia in older adults with DS is an urgent public health concern. The&#xD;
      investigators propose that nicotinic stimulation is a promising strategy to stabilize or&#xD;
      improve cognitive functioning in adults with DS, possibly with additional neuroprotective&#xD;
      effects. The investigators have extensive experience investigating the role of nicotinic&#xD;
      receptors on human cognition and impairment. This application takes advantage of new insights&#xD;
      into treating Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI-the precursor condition to Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      (AD) in typically developing individuals) with nicotine to propose an open label pilot study&#xD;
      of transdermal nicotine in middle-aged non-smoking DS patients who show early cognitive&#xD;
      and/or behavioral changes consistent with MCI/dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to establish preliminary evidence for safety, gain preliminary&#xD;
      evidence as to whether nicotine enhances cognitive functioning in DS adults, and examine&#xD;
      electrophysiological, biological, and behavioral correlates of nicotinic stimulation effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that positive results on cognitive or functional indices that would&#xD;
      lead to a larger and longer double-blind trial to test more definitively whether nicotinic&#xD;
      stimulation may be cognitively and/or functionally enhancing for DS patients. The knowledge&#xD;
      gained from the translational aspects of this project will guide the development of&#xD;
      potentially new nicotinic drugs in DS and generate, for the first time, data on the&#xD;
      importance of nicotinic receptor changes in the development of cognitive impairment in DS&#xD;
      adults. This work also represents the first time that cutting-edge advances in treating&#xD;
      MCI/AD in the general population are immediately and rigorously applied to those with DS.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will measure daily low-moderate dose nicotine treatment's changes to electrophysiological markers of memory performance using an incidental memory task. The incidental memory task consists of presenting participants with a series of 60 complex images, 50 of which are presented once, and 10 which are repeated 5 times each. The task measures the presence of the late positive potential (LPP), a positive deflection over the parietal cortex which is elevated for the repeated compared to the singly presented images. The presence of this potential is indicative of improved recognition memory.</description>

        <description>The investigators will measure daily low-moderate dose nicotine treatment's changes to electrophysiological markers of memory performance using an incidental memory task. The incidental memory task consists of presenting participants with a series of 60 complex images, 50 of which are presented once, and 10 which are repeated 5 times each. The task measures the presence of the late positive potential (LPP), a positive deflection over the parietal cortex which is elevated for the repeated compared to the singly presented images. The presence of this potential is indicative of improved recognition memory.</description>

        <description>Performance on the Conners' Continuous Performance Test, which is a measure of sustained attention. The main outcome measure was commission errors, which measures attention failures. The commission errors are calculated as T-scores. Higher T-scores indicate worse performance, lower T-scores indicate better performance. Average performance is a score of 50, with a standard deviation of 10.</description>
