  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, PET study in healthy male subjects to determine if GSK2647544 is able&#xD;
      to cross the blood-brain-barrier. The study will use GSK2647544 radiolabelled with&#xD;
      fluorine-18 ([18F] GSK2647544) to determine the ratio of the concentration of the compound in&#xD;
      tissue to that in plasma at equilibrium, expressed as the PET volume of distribution (VT).&#xD;
      The study will consist of at least four visits; 2 screening visits, scanning day and&#xD;
      follow-up. On Day 1 (scanning day) the subject will receive a single oral dose of GSK2647544&#xD;
      (100 mg) followed approximately 2 hours later by a single intravenous (IV) infusion of&#xD;
      [18F]-GSK2647544 and a dynamic PET scan. Arterial and venous blood sampling will be used to&#xD;
      determine the plasma kinetics of [18F]-GSK2647544 and unlabeled GSK2647544. In addition, each&#xD;
      subject will undergo a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain to aid&#xD;
      in the definition of neuroanatomy. The dose of GSK2647544 was selected based on the review of&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) data obtained in&#xD;
      the first time in human (FTIH) study.&#xD;
