  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to adapt, improve, and implement a peer mentor support and&#xD;
      caregiver education (PERSEVERE) program to improve LBD-specific caregiving mastery. Lewy body&#xD;
      dementia (LBD) is the second most common dementia, comprising Parkinson's Disease (PD)&#xD;
      dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. LBD causes deterioration in multiple cognitive,&#xD;
      motor, and neuropsychiatric domains, leading to heavy reliance on family caregivers. Patients&#xD;
      with LBD are at a far greater risk of hospitalizations for falls, neuro-psychiatric symptoms,&#xD;
      and infections, which are often preventable or treatable at home if recognized. Studies cite&#xD;
      a crucial need for education and support of LBD caregivers, who face high rates of caregiver&#xD;
      strain and adverse outcomes. Evidence from other chronic conditions supports peer mentoring&#xD;
      as a potentially effective intervention to provide education and social support. PERSEVERE&#xD;
      builds on our team's ongoing work of creating and testing a peer mentoring program for&#xD;
      homebound PD patients' caregivers that has shown promising feasibility and acceptability. In&#xD;
      the proposed project, the investigators will convene focus groups of former mentors and&#xD;
      mentees, along with current caregivers, to provide formative information to shape the revised&#xD;
      PERSEVERE curriculum that will include in-person mentor training and a comprehensive&#xD;
      mentoring handbook. The curriculum will focus on key areas of LBD caregiving mastery,&#xD;
      including: fall prevention, infections, neuropsychiatric symptoms (particularly&#xD;
      hallucinations, delusions, anxiety, and depression), and advance directives. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll and train a new cohort of 36 LBD caregiver peer mentors who will be&#xD;
      matched with 30 current LBD caregivers. Each pair will be instructed to speak on a weekly&#xD;
      basis, using the 16-week structured curriculum as a framework. The study team will support&#xD;
      the mentors with monthly conference calls and day-to-day availability for concerns. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess the feasibility and fidelity of the intervention via online study&#xD;
      diaries tracking the frequency, duration, and content of calls. During mentor training, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess the change in mentors' caregiver mastery and LBD knowledge pre- and&#xD;
      post-training. During the PERSEVERE intervention, the investigators will determine the change&#xD;
      in mentees' caregiver mastery, LBD knowledge, and loneliness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scientific Premise. PERSEVERE is a theory-based intervention that applies Social Cognitive&#xD;
      Theory constructs to the revised Stress Process Model to improve caregiving mastery and&#xD;
      ultimately, outcomes. PERSEVERE targets education about common causes of hospitalization in&#xD;
      LBD patients combined with social support from trained peer mentors to enhance caregivers'&#xD;
      mastery and LBD knowledge. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) proposes that behavior change is&#xD;
      dynamic, affected by expectations, observational learning, and reciprocal influences from the&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures. Aim 1 (Fall 2020): Revise the mentor training curriculum, conversation&#xD;
      guides, and resource handbook. The team will convene focus groups of previously trained&#xD;
      mentors, LBD caregivers, and LBD professionals, present each group with the original mentor&#xD;
      curriculum (training presentation slides and handbook) and the proposed educational resources&#xD;
      for inclusion in the revised curriculum and obtain their feedback. Framework analysis will be&#xD;
      used to guide the revision of the mentoring curriculum, with provision of practical&#xD;
      checklists, goal setting, and step-by-step guides for key areas of LBD caregiving mastery in&#xD;
      addition to social support, structured as the 16-week PERSEVERE curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (Winter 2021): Recruit and screen 36 peer mentors as PERSEVERE is being revised,&#xD;
      followed by two 6-7 hour training sessions for mentors in early 2021. Each selected mentor&#xD;
      will attend one training session, where the following content will be delivered: 1) study&#xD;
      logistics, expectations, and informed consent; 2) baseline mentor data collection; 3) active&#xD;
      listening, mentoring, goal- and boundary-setting; 4) overview of LBD, risk factors for&#xD;
      hospitalization, impact on caregiver; and 5) practical approaches to symptom management and&#xD;
      caregiving issues. The week-by-week PERSEVERE curriculum will be presented along with the&#xD;
      accompanying handbook. The investigators will solicit questions and role-play conversations.&#xD;
      The study team will encourage mentors to direct their mentees to call their respective&#xD;
      medical teams with specific medical questions, however the study team will inform the mentors&#xD;
      that they may contact the study team directly for non-emergent advice and resources. Mentors&#xD;
      will complete post-training assessments and will receive a training stipend. Mentors'&#xD;
      caregiver mastery will be assessed using Pearlin and Schooler's scale pre- and post-training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 (Spring-Summer 2021): Recruit 30 LBD caregivers and conduct baseline assessments&#xD;
      including demographics, relationship to LBD patient, and duration of caregiving. Mentors will&#xD;
      be matched to caregivers by relationship to LBD patient, then by sex and age, as much as&#xD;
      possible. Mentor-mentee pairs will be formed and the PERSEVERE handbook and contact&#xD;
      information will be distributed. Pairs will be expected to speak for &gt;15-30 minutes weekly,&#xD;
      and to review that week's PERSEVERE topics in the handbook before or during each call to&#xD;
      facilitate meaningful conversations. Discussions are not scripted and will not necessarily be&#xD;
      limited to that week's topics. Mentors and mentees will complete online study diaries every 2&#xD;
      weeks, assessing intervention fidelity. Up to 3 reminders will be sent to complete each study&#xD;
      diary, and if missing, a team member will call the participant(s). Mentors will participate&#xD;
      in a total of 4 recorded monthly conferences with the study team. Mentees' caregiver mastery,&#xD;
      strain, anxiety, and depression will be assessed at baseline and after the 16-week program.&#xD;
      Feasibility will be assessed via online surveys and study team phone call follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will determine the necessary qualities of mentors and matching, the content&#xD;
      of the mentor training and PERSEVERE handbook, and the effect sizes of the intervention to&#xD;
      determine the sample size for a forthcoming R01.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects participating in focus groups will be either:&#xD;
caregiver mentees in our previous peer mentoring study&#xD;
peer mentors and completed 16 weeks of mentoring in our previous peer mentoring study&#xD;
current family caregivers of community-dwelling LBD patients in the Chicago area.&#xD;
The investigators will conduct virtual focus groups using a password-protected videoconference platform. The informed consent process will take place online prior to the focus group. Focus groups will be led by a qualified neuropsychologist using open-ended questions. The aim of these groups is to revise and improve upon our previous peer mentor program's curriculum. Participants will be presented with the previous program's curriculum and a variety of proposed educational resources for inclusion in the revised curriculum. The investigators will obtain participants' feedback. Focus groups will be recorded and transcribed.</description>

    <description>Mentors will attend one 6-7 hour virtual training session. Study expectations and logistics will be reviewed with each potential mentor prior to the training session via phone. Informed consent process will take place online via REDCap prior to the training session. Baseline data will be collected via online surveys. Next, mentors will receive training regarding topics including active listening, mentoring, goal-and boundary-setting, an overview of LBD, risk factors for hospitalization, impact on caregiver, practical approaches to symptom management, and caregiving issues. The study team will present the PERSEVERE curriculum and accompanying handbook. The team will solicit questions and lead roleplay conversations. Finally mentors will complete post-training assessments. Once all caregiver mentees (Arm 3) are recruited, the mentors will contact their mentees once weekly by phone for 16 weeks to deliver the PERSEVERE curriculum.</description>

    <description>Once Aim 2 is complete and mentors have been trained, caregiver mentees will be matched with mentors by relationship to LBD patient, then by sex and age, as much as possible. The study team will contact mentees once a match is available for them. The mentee will complete baseline primary and secondary outcome assessments online via REDCap, including: mastery and loneliness scales, Short Zarit Burden Interview, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The team will provide the mentor's contact information and send the PERSEVERE handbook. Mentoring pairs will begin the 16-week peer mentor program. Pairs will be expected to speak for &gt;15-30 minutes weekly, and to review that week's PERSEVERE topics in the handbook before or during each call to facilitate meaningful conversations. Mentors and mentees will complete online study diaries every 2 weeks. Upon completion of the 16-week mentor program, mentors and mentees will be sent a link to complete postmentoring assessments online.</description>
