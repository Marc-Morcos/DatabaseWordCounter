  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EYE-TAR(AD+) is an observational study based on the same design as the princeps EYE-TAR(MA)&#xD;
      study, but with a larger number of patients and including an additional evaluation of Facial&#xD;
      emotion recognition (based on a more ecological material), in order to reinforce conclusions&#xD;
      of the study EYE-TAR(MA) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.npg.2020.08.003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to confirm that facial emotion recognition can be improved in AD using&#xD;
      the &quot;Training of Affect Recognition program&quot; (TAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the impact of the &quot;Training of Affect Recognition program&quot; (TAR) on oculomotor&#xD;
      behavior in a situation of social cognition, on behavioral disorders and on caregiver burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirm that improvement in facial emotion recognition is related to modification of&#xD;
      observation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirm the link between improved recognition of facial emotions, reduced behavioral&#xD;
      disorders and caregiver burden.&#xD;

    <measure>Facial emotion recognition (FER) performances</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 6; 1 month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline and Comparison of FER performance between AD-TAR group and AD-Cognitive Stimulation group.&#xD;
Evaluation criteria: Scores to Ekman Faces task (1976). FER was assessed using pictures from the Ekman Faces task (1976), to test the recognition of the six facial basic emotions and neutral faces. There were four pictures per emotion, for a total of 28. For each picture, participants were asked to select one of the seven labels (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, surprise and neutral), with a maximum of 8 seconds of response time per picture.</description>

FER was assessed using pictures from the Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set (ADFES/ Van Der Schalk J, Hawk ST, Fischer AH, Doosje B. Moving faces, looking places: validation of the Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set (ADFES). Emotion. 2011;11(4):907-20.), to test the recognition of the six facial basic emotions and neutral faces. There were four pictures per emotion, for a total of 28. For each picture, participants were asked to select one of the seven labels (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, surprise and neutral), with a maximum of 8 seconds of response time per picture.</description>

    <measure>Behavioral disorders</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 6; 1 month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline and Comparison between AD-TAR group and AD-Cognitive Stimulation group, Evaluation criteria: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), a scale that includes ten behavioral items (delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability and aberrant motor behaviors) and two neurovegetative symptoms (sleep and appetite disorders). The evaluation was based on an interview with patients' primary caregivers. Both the frequency (/5) and the severity (/3) of each behavior were determined and a score was calculated by multiplying the frequency and the severity of each behavior observed during the last month.</description>
