  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a compelling need for a noninvasive imaging approach to measure S1P1 in both&#xD;
      preclinical models of diseases and humans. PET measures of S1P1 expression is critical for&#xD;
      elucidating the pathophysiological roles of S1P1 in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.&#xD;
      The relevance of S1P1 in clinical disease has become readily apparent with the FDA approval&#xD;
      of the S1P1 modulator FTY720 (fingolimod) for treating relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS). MS is&#xD;
      a chronic autoimmune, inflammatory disease caused by lymphocytic infiltration that leads to&#xD;
      demyelinating neurodegenerative disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the initial IND study is to determine the safety of the [11C]-CS1P1&#xD;
      for PET imaging of S1P1 expression. The investigators will first complete whole-body PET&#xD;
      dosimetry studies in healthy adult normal volunteers to calculate the actual radiation dose&#xD;
      of each human organ and determine the allowable dose for a human subject when receiving a&#xD;
      single dose for a PET scan. Second, complete imaging of the brain and lymph nodes of the neck&#xD;
      in a wide range of ages of healthy adult normal control participants, both male and females&#xD;
      to characterize [11C]-CS1P1 uptake in the brain and radiolabeled metabolite will be&#xD;
      completed. Finally, a comparison of the normal control participants to patients with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS) will be completed.&#xD;

        Aim 1: Dosimetry/ Safety Group Ten healthy adult volunteers (5 males and 5 females) will be&#xD;
        recruited and undergo whole-body PET/CT imaging for assessing the safety, dosimetry and&#xD;
        metabolism of [11C]-CS1P1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aim 2: Feasibility Cohort Aim 2A will consist of 24 adult volunteers that will be recruited&#xD;
        and scanned to characterize [11C] CS1P1 uptake on PET scans of the brain and cervical lymph&#xD;
        nodes, to assess for radiolabeled metabolites. Up to 20 participants who have completed Aim&#xD;
        2A will continue with the collection of test-retest and safety data, Aim 2B. Ten healthy&#xD;
        controls age and gender-matched to 10 participants with MS will be invited to return for&#xD;
        repeat imaging for test-retest reliability not less than 7 days after and not more than 12&#xD;
        months after baseline imaging.&#xD;
