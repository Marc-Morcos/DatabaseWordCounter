  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2b, double-blind, placebo controlled proof-of-concept study of a an oral&#xD;
      small molecule selective inhibitor of p38 alpha kinase, neflamapimod, administered for 24&#xD;
      weeks in subjects with mild Alzheimer's disease. The primary objective is to demonstrate&#xD;
      significant improvement relative to placebo-treatment in episodic memory function, as&#xD;
      assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. Secondary endpoints include Clinical Dementia&#xD;
      Rating scale (CDR), Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) and&#xD;
      Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD disease activity and progression.&#xD;

    <measure>Total and Delayed Recall on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Combined change from baseline in z-scores of total and delayed recall on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R) in neflamapimod-treated subjects compared to placebo. The primary endpoint was analyzed using Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) with fixed effects for treatment, background AD-specific therapy, CDR-Global Score of 0.5 versus 1.0, scheduled visit (nominal) and scheduled visit by treatment interaction, random effect for subject and baseline Z-score as a covariate.&#xD;
For baseline total and delayed recall, a z-score for each subject is defined by z=(x-m)/s where x is the subject's recall at baseline, and m and s are the overall mean and overall standard deviation of recall at baseline across all subjects. A composite baseline z-score for each subject is calculated using equal weighting in the following way: Z=0.5*z-score for total recall at baseline + 0.5*z-score for delayed recall at baseline. For HVLT-R, higher score indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) Immediate and Delayed Recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in Wechsler Memory Scale(WMS) immediate and delayed recall composites in neflamapimod-treated subjects compared to placebo. WMS scores were analyzed using Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) with fixed effects for treatment, background AD-specific therapy, CDR-Global Score of 0.5 versus 1.0, scheduled visit (nominal) and scheduled visit by treatment interaction, random effect for subject and baseline Z-score as a covariate. Composite scores for immediate and delayed recall are the combination of all immediate and delayed recall task raw scores and ranges from 0-228. A higher score indicates improvement.&#xD;
The following tests in WMS are done both for immediate and delayed recall: Logical Memory test, in which subject is read a story; Verbal-Paired Associates, in which subject is given pairs of words and asked remember which words go together; and Visual Reproduction, in which subject is given drawings of specific shapes</description>

    <measure>Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in total score of Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes (range 0-18) in neflamapimod-treated subjects compared to placebo. CDR-SB scores were analyzed using Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) with fixed effects for treatment, background AD-specific therapy, CDR-Global Score of 0.5 versus 1.0, scheduled visit (nominal) and scheduled visit by treatment interaction, random effect for subject and baseline Z-score as a covariate. CDR-SB score is calculated by adding the individual scores from 6 domains, Memory, Orientation, Judgement and Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home and Hobbies, and Personal Care. CDR-SB scores range from 0-18, where a lower score indicates improvement. The scale is administered in a semi-structured interview format with both the patient and the caregiver/informant.</description>

    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 26 Weeks (Follow-up visit, 2 weeks from end of dosing)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were compared using an ANCOVA with treatment group, background AD-specific therapy, CDR-Global Score as main effects and the baseline assessment as the covariate. The results of the ANCOVA are summarized using the treatment groups' least square means, the difference between the treatment groups' least square means, the 95% confidence interval for the treatment group difference and the p-value. The MMSE is scored from 0-30 with a higher score indicating improvement. The MMSE includes questions that test orientation, attention, memory, language and visual-spatial skills.</description>

        <title>Total and Delayed Recall on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R)</title>
        <description>Combined change from baseline in z-scores of total and delayed recall on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R) in neflamapimod-treated subjects compared to placebo. The primary endpoint was analyzed using Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) with fixed effects for treatment, background AD-specific therapy, CDR-Global Score of 0.5 versus 1.0, scheduled visit (nominal) and scheduled visit by treatment interaction, random effect for subject and baseline Z-score as a covariate.&#xD;
For baseline total and delayed recall, a z-score for each subject is defined by z=(x-m)/s where x is the subject's recall at baseline, and m and s are the overall mean and overall standard deviation of recall at baseline across all subjects. A composite baseline z-score for each subject is calculated using equal weighting in the following way: Z=0.5*z-score for total recall at baseline + 0.5*z-score for delayed recall at baseline. For HVLT-R, higher score indicates improvement.</description>

Composite scores for immediate and delayed recall are the combination of all immediate and delayed recall task raw scores and ranges from 0-228. A higher score indicates improvement.&#xD;
The following tests in WMS are done both for immediate and delayed recall: Logical Memory test, in which subject is read a story; Verbal-Paired Associates, in which subject is given pairs of words and asked remember which words go together; and Visual Reproduction, in which subject is given drawings of specific shapes</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in total score of Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes (range 0-18) in neflamapimod-treated subjects compared to placebo. CDR-SB scores were analyzed using Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) with fixed effects for treatment, background AD-specific therapy, CDR-Global Score of 0.5 versus 1.0, scheduled visit (nominal) and scheduled visit by treatment interaction, random effect for subject and baseline Z-score as a covariate. CDR-SB score is calculated by adding the individual scores from 6 domains, Memory, Orientation, Judgement and Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home and Hobbies, and Personal Care. CDR-SB scores range from 0-18, where a lower score indicates improvement. The scale is administered in a semi-structured interview format with both the patient and the caregiver/informant.</description>

The results of the ANCOVA are summarized using the treatment groups' least square means, the difference between the treatment groups' least square means, the 95% confidence interval for the treatment group difference and the p-value. The MMSE is scored from 0-30 with a higher score indicating improvement. The MMSE includes questions that test orientation, attention, memory, language and visual-spatial skills.</description>

          <description>Changes from baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were compared using an ANCOVA with treatment group, background AD-specific therapy, CDR-Global Score as main effects and the baseline assessment as the covariate. The results of the ANCOVA are summarized using the treatment groups' least square means, the difference between the treatment groups' least square means, the 95% confidence interval for the treatment group difference and the p-value. The MMSE is scored from 0-30 with a higher score indicating improvement. The MMSE includes questions that test orientation, attention, memory, language and visual-spatial skills.</description>
