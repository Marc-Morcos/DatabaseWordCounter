      To reduce care resistant behaviors (CRB) among people with dementia residing in nursing&#xD;
      homes, to a distance-learning education, training, and coaching program for family caregivers&#xD;
      of people with dementia or TBI; assess the efficacy of the intervention for reducing&#xD;
      frequency or severity of CRB-triggered symptoms of agitation, aggression, and irritability;&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of the intervention for improving quality of life of patients,&#xD;
      caregivers, and families; and determine how patient and caregiver characteristics influence&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Evaluate how the intervention affects the health care costs of people with dementia or&#xD;
      TBI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To address the previously unanswered question of whether theoretically-driven caregiver&#xD;
      education and coaching in nonpharmacologic approaches to reduce care resistant behaviors as a&#xD;
      trigger of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms after Traumatic Brain Injury (NPTBI) will improve caregiver burden, quality of life&#xD;
      (QOL), and related outcomes of patients with these conditions and their family members. The&#xD;
      intervention of interest is the Neurobehavioral Non-Pharmacologic Supportive Strategies for&#xD;
      Family Caregivers of Persons with Dementia or TBI (NeuroNS-Care). Behavioral symptoms in&#xD;
      dementia and following TBI vary considerably over time, with a tendency toward spontaneous&#xD;
      regression to the mean. Additionally, caregivers often develop idiosyncratic strategies in&#xD;
      response to adverse behaviors that might be either adaptive or maladaptive. In order to&#xD;
      separate the effects of time alone from the effects of the coaching intervention, one group&#xD;
      will be randomized to delayed intervention following a 6 week wait time. This will allow the&#xD;
      investigative team the opportunity to compare the natural history of the outcome variables in&#xD;
      an &quot;untrained&quot; portion of the sample to the effects of training over a similar time period.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        50 participants with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease dementia (of all severity&#xD;
        stages) as defined by the NIA-Alzheimer's Association 2011 criteria will be enrolled, along&#xD;
        with a family (i.e., unpaid) caregiver. A second cohort of 25 participants who have&#xD;
        sustained moderate to severe TBI as diagnosed by UAB-TBIMS standards (generally Glasgow&#xD;
        Coma Scale score of 12 or less at admission, cranial imaging with evidence of acute&#xD;
        intracranial trauma, and/or post-traumatic amnesia duration of greater than 24 hours) ≥6&#xD;
        months prior to study entry (and their caregivers) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Entry is dependent on caregiver ratings on at least one of three behavioral domains of the&#xD;
        Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI): 1) Agitation/Aggression, 2) Disinhibition, 3)&#xD;
        Irritability /Lability. Based on standard scoring of the NPI, the caregiver must report all&#xD;
        of these for at least one domain:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Frequency of &quot;Often&quot; (several times per week but less than every day) or more,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severity of &quot;Moderate&quot; (stressful and upsetting; may require specific management) or&#xD;
             higher&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Distress of &quot;Moderate&quot; (fairly distressing, not always easy to cope with) or higher&#xD;
&#xD;
        The caregiver must also report that the adverse behavior is triggered by resistance to&#xD;
        care-related activities, e.g., bathing, taking medications, attending health-care&#xD;
        appointments, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ranges AD: ≥ 50 years; TBI ≥ 19; Caregiver ≥18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sex distribution: both men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Race: any.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Health: generally healthy and ambulatory or ambulatory-aided (i.e., walker or cane).&#xD;
             Vision and hearing (hearing aid permissible) sufficient for compliance with testing&#xD;
             procedures, or participants who per clinician criteria are deemed eligible to&#xD;
             participate in the study. .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive function and spoken/written English language skills sufficient to provide&#xD;
             valid results on neuropsychological testing, or participants who per clinician&#xD;
             criteria are deemed eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant medications: Subjects may be on stable doses of any psycho-active agents&#xD;
             for ≥30 days prior to screening and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caregiver: unpaid person who provides support or supervision for at least 1&#xD;
             instrumental activity of daily living for the affected person, with direct contact&#xD;
             averaging ≥5 of every 7 days, and ≥21 hours weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Access to high-speed/broad band internet service through home computer capable of&#xD;
             operating &quot;Go-to-Meeting&quot; or equivalent conferencing software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of a reliable caregiver who is willing to participate and comply with protocol&#xD;
             responsibilities (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of other psychiatric/neurologic disorders sufficient to be the primary source&#xD;
             of cognitive impairment (i.e., stroke, idiopathic Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia,&#xD;
             bipolar or unipolar depression, seizure disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychotic features (delusions or hallucinations) not adequately treated or not on&#xD;
             stable medical therapy for these conditions 30 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent (within the past 2 years) history of alcoholism or drug misuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject and/or caregivers who are unwilling or unable to fulfill the requirements of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition which would make the subject or the caregiver, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, unsuitable for the study.&#xD;
