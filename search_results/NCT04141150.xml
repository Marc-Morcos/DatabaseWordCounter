      The overall objective of this study is to compare the overall pattern of [18F]APN-1607 uptake&#xD;
      in subjects with MDAD, subjects with AD dementia, and healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To expand the safety and tolerability profile for the administration of [18F]APN-1607&#xD;
           and PET scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess regional patterns of [18F]APN-1607 uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the Braak stage equivalent reflected by [18F]APN-1607 uptake patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the relationship between regional measures of [18F]APN-1607 uptake and&#xD;
           demographic characteristics, eg, age and gender; biological characteristics, eg,&#xD;
           apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE4) carrier status and measures of Aβ burden; and&#xD;
           clinical characteristics, eg, measurements of AD disease severity, such as National&#xD;
           Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) diagnosis, Mini-mental Status&#xD;
           Exam (MMSE) score, and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale&#xD;
           (ADAScog).&#xD;

    <time_frame>22 months</time_frame>
    <description>Regional [18F]APN-1607 uptake patterns will be assessed in regions of interest (ROIs) and an iROI that are relevant to AD pathology. [18F]APN-1607 uptake patterns identified by regional analysis will be compared among healthy subjects, subjects with MDAD, and subjects with AD dementia. Standard uptake value (SUV) will be calculated for each ROI, and SUVRs will be calculated by normalizing SUV of ROIs to the SUV of relevant reference region. Mean and standard deviation of [18F]APN-1607 uptake (ie, SUVR) will be calculated across healthy, MDAD and AD dementia cohorts. Differences between groups will be tested at a P-value of 0.05 using statistical analyses methods (eg, unpaired t-test, ANOVA).</description>

&#xD;
          3. No cognitive impairment based on neuropsychological battery and as judged by the&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. The subject has an appropriate informant to accompany the subject on all visits and&#xD;
             provide information for the CDR.&#xD;
&#xD;

             dementia within the last 3 months (or 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer),&#xD;
             or received a non-vaccine treatment (ie, monoclonal antibody) for the treatment of AD&#xD;
             or other cause of dementia within the last 6 months, or has ever received a vaccine&#xD;

             pressure hydrocephalus or any other abnormalities associated with central nervous&#xD;

             after full recovery and further assessment by the Investigator per institutional&#xD;
             guidelines. A subject with a known history of being exposed to someone who was&#xD;
             diagnosed of COVID-19, during the prior 4 weeks, should not be enrolled unless the&#xD;
