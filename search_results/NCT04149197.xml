  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, multi-center, longitudinal cohort study to characterize adults with&#xD;
      DS ages 25 years and above enrolled at specialized care centers. The aim is to assess changes&#xD;
      in cognition, behavior, function and health over approximately 32 months. Blood will be&#xD;
      collected for the development of plasma AD biomarkers useful in the DS population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults with DS face a markedly increased risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). DS, the most&#xD;
      common genetic cause of AD, is due to trisomy for all or part of a third copy of chromosome&#xD;
      21. It is typically associated with the presence of a number of abnormal clinical phenotypes,&#xD;
      including craniofacial anatomy, and is universally characterized by mild to moderate&#xD;
      intellectual disability. Almost all adults with DS develop AD-like neuropathology by the age&#xD;
      of 40. While dementia may not be universal, the prevalence of AD in DS increases from 9% to&#xD;
      23% between the ages of 35 and 49 years, 55% in those between 50 and 59 years, and estimates&#xD;
      place it as greater than 75% in those 60 years of age and above. The average age at which&#xD;
      dementia is diagnosed is 55 years . Given shared clinical and neuropathological features, and&#xD;
      in view of shared genetic risk, this disorder is now termed AD in DS (AD-DS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the genes on chromosome 21 triplicated in DS the evidence is compelling that increased&#xD;
      gene dose for amyloid precursor protein (APP), with increased levels of the APP protein and&#xD;
      its products, is necessary for AD-DS. Other chromosome 21 genes may impact AD-DS as may genes&#xD;
      on other chromosomes, including variants that also increase the probability of AD, but a&#xD;
      uniquely important role is played by increased dose for APP. Given the APP gene&#xD;
      dose-dependence of AD-DS, and the recognition that a rare form of FAD is due to APP gene&#xD;
      duplication, it is not surprising that AD and AD-DS share common neuropathologies, including&#xD;
      accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Indeed, the&#xD;
      neuropathological hallmarks of AD-DS are very similar if not identical to AD. Thus, like AD,&#xD;
      beta-amyloid (Aβ) - principally Aβ42 - is the isoform of Aβ that dominates in diffuse&#xD;
      deposits and then in mature plaques; Aβ40 accumulates around cerebral vessels with&#xD;
      significantly higher frequencies in DS than in AD, recapitulating the congophilic angiopathy&#xD;
      of AD. However, distinct from AD, Aβ accumulation in DS occurs in young people with&#xD;
      deposition in diffuse plaques in those in the teenage years, decades earlier than in both&#xD;
      aged controls and individuals with AD. As in AD, amyloid deposition appears before NFT&#xD;
      formation and is present significantly before the development of dementia. An important&#xD;
      question is whether it is possible to prevent or mitigate the cognitive deficits and other&#xD;
      symptoms associated with AD-DS. Ascertaining the preclinical and prodromal stages of the&#xD;
      dementia could be particularly valuable. This approach has significantly advanced the field&#xD;
      in studies on other cases of genetically caused AD, i.e. those with familial AD (FAD) due to&#xD;
      mutations in APP or in its processing enzymes Presenilin 1 and 2. Given this rationale, we&#xD;
      will characterize the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD-DS by conducting longitudinal&#xD;
      observations that incorporate medical history and measures of cognition, behavior, and&#xD;
      function in adults with DS aged 25 years and above. The goal is to chart the cognitive,&#xD;
      behavioral and functional status of a population at high risk for AD-DS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specialty centers in the U.S. care for large populations of persons with DS and form the team&#xD;
      of recruiting sites in this study. The DS-CTN is a clinical research and trials network of&#xD;
      specialty centers in the U.S. expertly equipped to conduct work extending from design, to&#xD;
      execution, to analysis and publication of research that benefits the DS population through&#xD;
      discovery and delivery of effective treatments. The DS-CTN currently consists of 11 member&#xD;
      sites in the U.S. specializing in DS, and is comprised of scientific investigators and&#xD;
      clinicians, largely but not exclusively from academic research centers, whose focus is on&#xD;
      clinical trials in the DS population. The DS-CTN will support this observational study&#xD;
      through enrollment and longitudinal follow-up of participants. DS-CTN member sites will also&#xD;
      support this study by contributing expert feedback into protocol and data entry field&#xD;
      development, while also offering important feedback and input on the conduct and flow of the&#xD;
      study. The DS-CTN will be responsible for the analysis and publication of the study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males and females, aged 25 and older, with a diagnosis of DS, typically supported by&#xD;
      karyotype analysis documenting full trisomy for chromosome 21 or complete unbalanced&#xD;
      translocation of chromosome 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be balanced by the following age strata: 25 to 34 years old (target 25% of&#xD;
      enrollment), 35 to 44 (target 50% of enrollment), 45 years and older (target 25% of&#xD;
      enrollment).&#xD;

Frequency assessments range from 1 (occasionally, less than once per week) to 4 (very frequently, once or more per day or continuously). Severity assessments range from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe). The score for each subscale is the product of severity and frequency and the total score is the sum of all subscales.</description>

      A blood sample will be collected at the baseline, Month 16 and Month 32 visits for banking of&#xD;
      plasma for future biomarker studies, which may include analysis of AD biomarkers such as&#xD;
      amyloid beta (Aβ) or tau. In addition to biomarker analysis, future genotyping studies may&#xD;
      also be conducted. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) (e4 +/-) genotype and other genetic variations are&#xD;
      associated with the risk of onset of AD. Therefore, this blood sample collected at baseline,&#xD;
      Month 12 and Month 24 will also include banking of buffy coat for future gene analyses which&#xD;
      may include APOE testing of e2, e3, and e4 alleles as well as other genes associated with AD&#xD;
