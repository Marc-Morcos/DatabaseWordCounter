  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effects of the Neuro RX Gamma synchronous and asynchronous devices on&#xD;
      the cognitive and behavioral functioning of subjects with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease. The Neuro RX Gamma is non-invasive and delivers near-infrared energy to the brain in&#xD;
      daily treatment sessions at home. An optional substudy will involve the use of the&#xD;
      Electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess the effect of the treatment devices on the electrical&#xD;
      activity of the brain compared to sham.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Neuro RX Gamma system is a headset which emits pulsed near-infrared energy synchronously&#xD;
      or asynchronously through diodes placed on the scalp and inside a nostril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential participant will undergo screening procedures to confirm eligibility to&#xD;
      participate in the study, followed by randomization procedure to one of the study groups -&#xD;
      treatment synchronized, treatment asynchronized or sham (placebo). A dedicated caregiver will&#xD;
      apply the device to the subject for 20 minute daily sessions at home, 6 days a week for a&#xD;
      total of 12 weeks. The subject and caregiver will be required to return to the clinic for&#xD;
      follow-up assessments after 3, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. Participants will have the choice&#xD;
      of opting into a substudy involving the collection of rest EEG recordings during the baseline&#xD;
      and weeks 3, 6 and 12 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients will be enrolled in 2 clinical sites in Ontario, Canada.&#xD;

    <description>The ADCS CGIC gives the Clinician's assessment of the patient's response to the treatment. It is intended to be used as a measure of clinically meaningful change.
