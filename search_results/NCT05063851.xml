  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the US population ages, the prevalence of dementia is increasing, and Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      (AD) is the most prevalent one. Solving the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) epidemic is likely to&#xD;
      require preventive therapy beginning many years before symptoms are expected to be evident in&#xD;
      at-risk individuals. AD is caused by the dysfunction, loss of synapses, and eventual neuronal&#xD;
      death, which may occur up to 25 years before clinical symptoms appear. This study, based off&#xD;
      of pre-clinical data, seeks to assess whether it is feasible to use memantine hydrochloride&#xD;
      for the prevention of Alzheimer's Disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of memantine for prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is designed to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of the use of memantine hydrochloride for prevention of AD and provide design&#xD;
      elements for a Phase 3 efficacy study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 128 subjects will be enrolled/screened to achieve a sample size of 32 randomized&#xD;
      participants with a 1:1 randomization allocation. The study population will include&#xD;
      individuals, 50-65 years of age, who are APOE4 positive with a family history of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease who meet all other eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The schedule of assessments includes screening/baseline, treatment period (including&#xD;
      titration up/down) and follow up/end of study over 101 weeks for each subject. Study efficacy&#xD;
      assessments are the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status&#xD;
      (RBANS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study -&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL), Cognitive Function Index, Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Prevention Instrument Activities of&#xD;
      Daily Living - Prevention Instrument and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) Scale.&#xD;
      Safety assessments include the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)&#xD;
      Vital Signs, Physical/Neurological Exam, Electrocardiogram, Blood Chemistries, Urinalysis,&#xD;
      Medical History, Assessment of Adverse Events and Concomitant Medications, MRI and PET&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;

    <measure>To assess the feasibility of the use of memantine hydrochloride for prevention of Alzheimer's Disease as measured by the percentage of patients who are lost to follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of subjects who are lost to follow-up before completion of the protocol will be calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals. Calculations will be carried out in the entire randomized population, and by treatment arm. Loss to follow-up percentages will be compared between arms using Fisher's exact tests. Permutation tests will be used to assess if any baseline subject characteristics are associated with overall loss to follow-up percentages, or time to loss to follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Summary of demographic characteristics of subjects overall, and in each arm.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Permutation tests, Fisher's exact tests, or Mann-Whitney U-tests will be used depending on the data distributions observed. This is a needed design estimate for a Phase 3 efficacy trial.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in RBANS scores from baseline to end of protocol, overall and in each arm.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The changes from baseline to 24 months will be calculated for each individual who completes the study. Both absolute and relative changes will be computed for each measurement. T-tests or Mann-Whitney U-test will be used to compare the change scores between arms. Additionally, since measurements are also planned at 12 months, an analysis will be performed using all available data on each subject. This analysis will use a random effects model to estimate the trajectories of change over time in each arm. The random effects model will also be used to assess the potential effect of each demographic variable on the change in RBANS. This is a needed design estimate for a Phase 3 efficacy trial.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for longitudinal follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ICC will be calculated by dividing the random effects variance in the random effects model (above) by the total variance. This is a needed design estimate for a Phase 3 efficacy trial.</description>

The dose should be increased in 5 mg increments to 10 mg/day (5 mg twice daily), 15 mg/day (5 mg and 10 mg as separate doses), and 20 mg/day (10 mg twice daily). The minimum recommended interval between dose increases is one week. The dosage shown to be effective in controlled clinical trials is 20 mg/day.</description>
