    <textblock>
      This study involves the collection of cognitive and biomarker responses to HIGH and LOW meals&#xD;
      in healthy older adults with and without the APOE E4 genotype. Subjects will eat the meal&#xD;
      after an overnight fast, followed by cognitive testing, spinal fluid and blood collection.&#xD;
      The HIGH meal will be a meal high in saturated fat and high glycemic index foods vs. LOW meal&#xD;
      which will be low in saturated fat and low glycemic index foods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how the risk gene for Alzheimer's disease APOE&#xD;
      epsilon 4 (E4) influences acute cognitive responses to different types of meals. The&#xD;
      rationale for this study is that we know that a diet high in saturated fat and high glycemic&#xD;
      index foods (HIGH diet) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However we have found&#xD;
      paradoxically that a Western style HIGH diet acutely improved cognition in APOE E4 carriers,&#xD;
      but worsened cognition in E4 non-carriers. This experiment will examine mechanisms that&#xD;
      underlie this differential response between E4 carriers and non-carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll older adults who do not have dementia, half of which will be E4 carriers and&#xD;
      the other half will be non-carriers. Both groups will contain equal numbers of men and women.&#xD;
      These individuals will undergo two experiments in which they eat either a high or a low fat&#xD;
      meal, and then after the meal will undergo several tests. The outcome measures include blood&#xD;
      measures of metabolic markers, cognitive tests that are known to be sensitive to changes even&#xD;
      after a single meal, and spinal fluid measures of Alzheimer's biomarkers such as&#xD;
      beta-amyloid, as well as spinal fluid levels of lipids, glucose and insulin. This study will&#xD;
      allow us to test whether high and low fat meals acutely affect cognitive and Alzheimer's&#xD;
      biomarkers, and if those changes depend on APOE genotype or gender. It is our hope that this&#xD;
      work will contribute to our broader understanding about the risks of diet and AD, to help us&#xD;
      understand more about how to prevent and treat this devastating neurological disease.&#xD;

    <description>The study will examine CSF biomarker responses to HIGH and LOW meals in 80 men and women with and without the E4 allele in a cross-over design.

             statin, bile acid resins, fibrate medications, and/or high dose niacin will be&#xD;
             excluded, as these medications may interfere with the study outcomes. If subjects are&#xD;
             on omega-3 fatty acids, low dose niacin, or other alternative/herbal remedies such as&#xD;
             red yeast rice, they can be enrolled if they agree to stop the medication during the&#xD;
             study period. Also excluded are significant cholesterol abnormalities as defined by&#xD;
             the Adult Treatment Panel III classification: LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL, total&#xD;
             cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL, or triglycerides &gt; 200. HDL levels outside of the typical&#xD;
             range are ok.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Dementia and cognitive impairment: Known diagnosis of dementia, use of dementia&#xD;
             medications, or identification of dementia during the baseline visit, will be&#xD;
             excluded. Also excluded are other significant neurologic diseases which affect&#xD;
             cognition, such as recent stroke, recent severe head injury, or advanced Parkinson's&#xD;
             disease. Mild cognitive impairment with no functional deficits is ok.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Contraindications to lumbar puncture: Those with medical conditions that preclude a&#xD;
             lumbar puncture such as an intracranial tumor, lower spinal hardware, or use of&#xD;
             anticoagulation, will be excluded. Daily aspirin for prevention is ok. Use of NSAIDS&#xD;
             is ok as long as participant uses them as needed rather than daily, and is able to&#xD;
             discontinue these agents two days prior to the LP procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Significant medical illnesses: Illnesses which would cause a hardship on the&#xD;
             participant to attend study visits and undergo a lumbar puncture. This includes&#xD;
             uncontrolled severe hypertension, unstable angina or cardiovascular disease, moderate&#xD;
             pulmonary disease (COPD), and Class III-IV congestive heart failure (CHF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Active malignancy undergoing treatment with chemotherapeutic or radiation treatments.&#xD;
             Remote history of treated cancer is ok, as long as current cognition and digestion are&#xD;
             not affected&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Treatment with hormones: Use of estrogen, testosterone, and continuous corticosteroid&#xD;

             be post-menopausal for at least 1 year before enrolling in the study, or be one year&#xD;
             out from a hysterectomy. Women who use hormone replacement therapy for symptomatic&#xD;
             menopause can be enrolled, if they agree to discontinue the medication four weeks&#xD;
             before the first meal and then throughout the study. Transgendered subjects can be&#xD;
             included in the study, provided that they are not taking sex steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Psychiatric disorders: Subjects who report active untreated major depression,&#xD;
             psychosis, or mania, or who present with those symptoms at the baseline visit, will be&#xD;
             excluded. Psychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),&#xD;

             syndrome, and celiac disease. History of surgical procedures which may affect the&#xD;
             absorption of meals, such as any weight loss surgery such as gastric bypass or&#xD;
             banding, or small intestine resection. Acid reflux is allowed if participant is on a&#xD;
             stable medication regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Food allergies and intolerances: Those subjects allergic to the ingredients of the&#xD;
             meals will be excluded. Also excluded are medical conditions requiring strict&#xD;
             adherence to a particular diet, such as celiac disease or phenylketonuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Alcohol use: While they are in the study, subjects will be asked to limit their&#xD;
             alcohol intake to two drinks per day or less for men, or one drink per day or less for&#xD;
             women, due to alcohol's effects on lipid biochemistry and the study outcomes. Subjects&#xD;
             who are unable or unwilling to meet these criteria will not be enrolled.&#xD;
