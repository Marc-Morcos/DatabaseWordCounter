    <textblock>
      This community-based translational trial tests the value of a proven non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      intervention for older adults living with dementia and informal caregivers when this&#xD;
      intervention is incorporated into a publicly-funded home and community based service program.&#xD;
      Half the participants will receive customary publicly-funded services alone, and half will&#xD;
      receive customary services plus the proven non-pharmacologic intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 5 million Americans have dementia and more than 15 million Americans, mostly family&#xD;
      members, provide unpaid care to these individuals. In the absence of a cure or widely&#xD;
      effective pharmacotherapy to combat dementia, translation and implementation of efficacious&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic interventions into existing service programs are sorely needed. The&#xD;
      Connecticut Home Care Program for Elders (CHCPE), a Medicaid waiver and state revenue-funded&#xD;
      program for older adults at high risk for nursing home admission, provides in-home and&#xD;
      community-based services coordinated by care managers. In this translational study, an&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention, Care of Persons with Dementia in their Environments (COPE), is&#xD;
      incorporated into the CHCPE. COPE is an efficacious 4-month, in-home, non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      intervention using occupational therapists and advanced practice nurses to maximize physical&#xD;
      function in older adults with dementia and to improve dementia management skills of family&#xD;
      caregivers (CG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will randomly assign 290 CHCPE clients with dementia and their CGs to receive&#xD;
      either COPE plus customary CHCPE services, or customary CHCPE services alone. The main study&#xD;
      outcome measures are similar to those of the original COPE efficacy trial. To maximize the&#xD;
      translational effort, this study also will: conduct a formal cost-benefit analysis to&#xD;
      determine the potential economic benefit of adding COPE to customary CHCPE services; evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of COPE as a new CHCPE service; and establish an expert&#xD;
      Translational Advisory Committee to help develop and guide COPE dissemination plans for&#xD;
      implementation nationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims for CHCPE clients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1.1: Determine COPE effect on functional dependence 4 months after randomization (primary&#xD;
      study endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1.2: Determine COPE effects on engagement in activities, quality of life, and NPS, 4&#xD;
      months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1.3: Determine COPE effects on functional dependence, engagement in activities, quality&#xD;
      of life, and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), 12 months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that CHCPE clients receiving COPE will show greater reduction in functional&#xD;
      dependence, greater engagement in activities, better quality of life, and fewer&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms, compared to controls, 4 months and 12 months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims for CGs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2.1: Determine COPE effect on perceived CG well-being 4 months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2.2: Determine COPE effects on CG confidence in using dementia management strategies 4&#xD;
      months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2.3: Determine COPE effects on CG perceived well-being, confidence in using activities,&#xD;
      and ability to keep client at home, 12 months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that COPE CGs will report improvement in all specified outcomes compared to&#xD;
      controls, 4 and 12 months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translational study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3.1: Determine the net financial benefit of COPE, accounting for COPE intervention costs,&#xD;
      CHCPE usual care costs, nursing home costs, and other service costs, 4 months and 12 months&#xD;
      after randomization. The 12 month cost-benefit analysis will test whether financial benefits&#xD;
      of COPE accrue over a longer time horizon than the 4-month intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3.2: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of COPE implementation into the CHCPE&#xD;
      from multiple stakeholder viewpoints, including CHCPE care managers and state Medicaid and&#xD;
      public policy decision makers.&#xD;

    <description>The metric for the primary outcome measure is score on the 15-item Caregiver Assessment of Function and Upset (CAFU) measure. The CAFU is adapted from the Functional Independence Measure; each of the 15 items is an activity of daily living (ADL) or instrumental activity of daily living (IADL). Each ADL and IADL item is scored on a 7-point scale ranging from completely independent (score of 7) to needing complete help (score of 1). Person-level functional dependence scores are calculated by summing scores across all items and dividing by the number of items.</description>
