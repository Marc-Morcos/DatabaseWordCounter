  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to investigate the safety of candesartan, a blood pressure medication,&#xD;
      in non-hypertensive individuals who have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease and its effect on disease biomarkers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind placebo-control randomized clinical trial that compares candesartan to&#xD;
      placebo in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who also have positive&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarkers. The investigators will assess if blocking the effect of&#xD;
      Ang II using angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is safe in non hypertensive MCI individuals&#xD;
      and whether the use of candesartan will be associated with changes in cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      disease biomarkers.&#xD;

    <description>Hypotension is defined as blood pressure &lt;100/40 mm Hg. Blood pressure was measured according to the American Heart Association guidelines with the subject in the sitting position and rested for 5 minutes. An appropriate cuff size (covering 60% of upper arm length and 80% of arm circumference) was used and correct cuff placement (1-2 inches above the brachial pulse on bare arm) was ensured.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR rates each of the six general domains involving memory, orientation, judgment and problem-solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care.

    <measure>EXecutive Abilities: Measures and Instruments for Neurobehavioral Evaluation and Research (EXAMINER) Toolbox Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EXAMINER toolbox battery includes 11 tasks that generate 15 primary variables. Within this set, the EXAMINER includes working memory, inhibition, set shifting, and fluency. The parts of EXAMINER that were used for this study include: Flanker task (inhibition) which involves responding to a central stimulus while ignoring flanking stimuli that are either compatible or incompatible with the central stimulus; Set-shifting, a measure of mental flexibility; Spatial 1-Back test assesses spatial working memory; Dot Counting test assesses verbal working memory; Verbal Fluency tested using a List Generation test which require the participant to generate words beginning with a specific letter, and category fluency in which the participant generates words from a specified category (e.g., animals, fruits). A composite score is calculated where scores range from -1 to +1 and higher are reflective of better executive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) Delayed Recall Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) is used to assess memory domains. Participants are read a list of 12 words and are asked to recall as many as they can remember. This is repeated for 3 trials followed by a 20 minute delay, and then participants are asked to recall as many words as they can. The delayed recall score ranges from 0 to 12 and higher scores indicate better memory.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trail Making Test (TMT) Part B</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail Making Test assesses executive function. In Part B of the TMT participants connect circles labeled with letters and numbers, in ascending order. The score is the amount of time it takes for the participant to complete the task. The average time is 75 seconds and times greater than 273 seconds indicate a deficit with executive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trail Making Test (TMT) Part B - A</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>In Part A of the TMT participants connect circles labeled with numbers, in ascending order. The score is the amount of time it takes for the participant to complete the task. The TMT Part A score reflects visuoperceptual abilities and subtracting the score for Part A from the score from Part B provides a more accurate assessment of executive function. Lower scores indicate greater executive function.</description>

An appropriate cuff size (covering 60% of upper arm length and 80% of arm circumference) was used and correct cuff placement (1-2 inches above the brachial pulse on bare arm) was ensured.</description>

The parts of EXAMINER that were used for this study include: Flanker task (inhibition) which involves responding to a central stimulus while ignoring flanking stimuli that are either compatible or incompatible with the central stimulus; Set-shifting, a measure of mental flexibility; Spatial 1-Back test assesses spatial working memory; Dot Counting test assesses verbal working memory; Verbal Fluency tested using a List Generation test which require the participant to generate words beginning with a specific letter, and category fluency in which the participant generates words from a specified category (e.g., animals, fruits). A composite score is calculated where scores range from -1 to +1 and higher are reflective of better executive function.</description>

        <title>Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) Delayed Recall Score</title>
        <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) is used to assess memory domains. Participants are read a list of 12 words and are asked to recall as many as they can remember. This is repeated for 3 trials followed by a 20 minute delay, and then participants are asked to recall as many words as they can. The delayed recall score ranges from 0 to 12 and higher scores indicate better memory.</description>

        <description>The Trail Making Test assesses executive function. In Part B of the TMT participants connect circles labeled with letters and numbers, in ascending order. The score is the amount of time it takes for the participant to complete the task. The average time is 75 seconds and times greater than 273 seconds indicate a deficit with executive function.</description>

The TMT Part A score reflects visuoperceptual abilities and subtracting the score for Part A from the score from Part B provides a more accurate assessment of executive function. Lower scores indicate greater executive function.</description>
