  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest cause of dementia. There is no effective treatment&#xD;
      to cure the disease. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, are widely recommended to&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate AD. But the cognitive function of most of the patients using&#xD;
      donepezil gradually aggravate, with Mini-Mental State Examination(MMSE) score falling by 2&#xD;
      points per year on average, and donepezil cannot effectively delay AD progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DL-3-n-butylphthalide(NBP) is a synthetic chiral compound containing L- and D-isomers of&#xD;
      butylphthalide. It is developed from L-3-n-butylphthalide, which was initially isolated as a&#xD;
      pure component from seeds of Apium graveolens in 1978 by researchers of Institute of Medicine&#xD;
      of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Studies in the past several decades have demonstrated&#xD;
      that NBP is effective in alleviating oxidative damage and mitochondria dysfunction, improving&#xD;
      microcirculation. NBP was approved by the State Food and Drug Administration of China (SFDA)&#xD;
      as a therapeutic drug for treatment of ischemic stroke in 2005 Not only for ischemic stroke,&#xD;
      NBP has been reported to increase the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype glutamate&#xD;
      receptor 2B(NR2B) and synaptophysin in hippocampus of aged rats after chronic cerebral&#xD;
      hypoperfusion and increasing brain acetylcholine level, which are important processes&#xD;
      involved in learning and memory. It could alleviate the learning and memory deficits induced&#xD;
      by cerebral ischemia in rats. A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial conducted by Professor Jia investigated that NBP was effective for improving cognitive&#xD;
      and global functioning in patients with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment without&#xD;
      dementia and exhibited good safety over the 6-month treatment period. The pathogenesis of AD&#xD;
      involved mitochondria dysfunction and microcirculation dysfunction, which are the action&#xD;
      targets of NBP. Investigators observed that MMSE score lowering slowly when using NBP&#xD;
      treatment in patients with mild to moderate AD already receiving donepezil. But investigators&#xD;
      lack of system evaluation and follow-up. Hence, investigators hypothesized that NBP may have&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy for patients with AD and designed the present study.&#xD;
