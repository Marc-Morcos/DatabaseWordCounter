  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial on 60+ aged and independent-living healthy individuals with&#xD;
      symptoms of insomnia will attempt to improve sleep and health outcomes related to sleep with&#xD;
      enhancement of a clinical intervention, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telehealth-delivered enhanced CBTi (integrated with a sleep diary app, a therapist dashboard,&#xD;
      and data from IoT devices) will be compared to standard telehealth CBTi and to usual&#xD;
      treatment with sleep hygiene education. The investigators will determine effects on insomnia&#xD;
      (primary outcome) and on clinical sleep metrics (secondary outcome), among other outcomes&#xD;
      including cognitive performance, blood biomarkers of ADRD, and therapeutic adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening consent and qualification, informed consent, and adherence evaluation with&#xD;
      ambulatory devices (1wk), study participants are pseudo-randomized into one of 3 study arms&#xD;
      (2:2:1, Enhanced CBTi : Standard CBTi : Sleep Hygiene). The living space of participants is&#xD;
      equipped with IoT data collection devices. Participants take surveys related to sleep, have&#xD;
      blood drawn, wear ambulatory devices, complete cognitive evaluations, and interact with&#xD;
      nearable living space devices and an iPhone interface during a preparation week leading up to&#xD;
      an intake telehealth appointment. Baseline data collection (1wk) occurs. Participants then&#xD;
      adhere to behavioral therapy directives prescribed at weekly telehealth sessions with a&#xD;
      clinically qualified therapist, take surveys related to sleep, complete cognitive&#xD;
      evaluations, wear ambulatory devices, and interact with nearable living space devices and an&#xD;
      iPhone interface throughout the study intervention period of 6 weeks. During the final week&#xD;
      (coinciding with the 6th intervention week), participants have a second blood draw and return&#xD;
      all study equipment/devices at the conclusion of participation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly (each of study weeks 1-8)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective patient completion of the Insomnia Severity Index survey. Sum of survey item responses; Minimum score: 0; Maximum score: 28. Higher sum score indicates a greater number of, or more severe, insomnia symptoms; reduction in sum score suggests improvement of insomnia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep Maintenance Efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Nightly (each night throughout study weeks 1-8)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective ambulatory activity (actigraphy) and other biometric data will be collectively used to determine sleep state. From sleep state data, Sleep Maintenance Efficiency will be calculated (i.e. percentage of time between sleep onset and awakening for the main sleep period that is spent in the sleep state). Minimum score: 0% (i.e. no sleep); Maximum score: 100% (i.e. no awake time during the sleep window). Higher percentage score indicates that a greater proportion of the rest interval was spent actually asleep; increase in percentage score suggests improvement in sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Total Sleep Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Nightly (each night throughout study weeks 1-8)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective ambulatory activity (actigraphy) and other biometric data will be collectively used to determine sleep state. From sleep state data, Total Sleep Time will be calculated (i.e. total minutes of nocturnal sleep). An increase in sleep time indicates improvement in sleep quantity.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive test battery performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily: Baseline (throught 1st-2nd study weeks) and Post-Treatment (throughout 8th study week)</time_frame>

    <description>Blood biomarkers suggestive of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), including beta-amyloid (Aβ), Tau, Neurofilament Light chain protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Blood biomarkers indicative of inflammation, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and Interleukin inflammatory cytokines.</description>
