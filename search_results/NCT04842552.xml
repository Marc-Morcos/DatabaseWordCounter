  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been recently discovered that the FDA-approved drug, hydralazine, has&#xD;
      anti-neurodegenerative efficacy based on three intriguing observations. hydralazine; 1)&#xD;
      activates the Nrf2 pathway that controls more than 200 antioxidant proteins, 2) rejuvenates&#xD;
      mitochondria and increases their respiration capacity and adenosine triphosphate production,&#xD;
      3) activates autophagy which has pathophysiological roles such as intracellular aggregate&#xD;
      clearance. There is an emerging agreement that autophagy-lysosome defects occur early in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nrf2 is another pathway known to be impaired in the&#xD;
      hippocampus of AD patients who need antioxidant protection the most. Rejuvenation of&#xD;
      mitochondria is crucial for fighting AD, as neuronal cells need more energy to afford&#xD;
      activation of pathways such as autophagy and Nrf2. The prime objective of this application is&#xD;
      to conduct a randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of hydralazine in early-stage&#xD;
      AD patients who take one of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) donepezil,&#xD;
      rivastigmine, or galantamine.&#xD;

      Study aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determination and comparison of the effect of 75mg (25mg TDS) hydralazine vs. placebo in&#xD;
           patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Development of an electronic Case Report Form (CRF) and push notification system to&#xD;
           remind patients (and/or caregivers) of drug intake to improve drug intake adherence and&#xD;
           reduce follow-up losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of the prognostic accuracy of olfactory tests to predict the changes in&#xD;
           cognition and performance of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase III, triple-blind, parallel double-armed randomized clinical trial with an&#xD;
      allocation ratio of 1-1 to the intervention and placebo arms. This trial will be conducted on&#xD;
      424 randomly selected patients using random permuted blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings and conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who are identified as potentially eligible by the supporting neurologists and&#xD;
      psychiatrists will be referred to Adineh Clinic to evaluate their cognitive function, assess&#xD;
      for inclusion and exclusion criteria and obtain informed consent. The two arms of the study&#xD;
      are hydralazine 75mg (25mg three times per day) or hydralazine placebo. A follow-up&#xD;
      evaluation will continue for one year after drug administration. The participants, outcome&#xD;
      assessors, researchers, and data analyzers will be blinded to the study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants/Inclusion and exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      patients over the age of 49 and over who are diagnosed with mild to moderate AD will be&#xD;
      included in this study; dementia patients with etiologies other than AD (i.e. vascular&#xD;
      dementia) will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two arms of the study are Hydralazine 75mg (25mg three times per day) or Hydralazine&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various cognitive and function tests for patients and caregivers, olfactory tests,&#xD;
      biochemistry as well as drug side effects will be assessed regularly over the period of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
