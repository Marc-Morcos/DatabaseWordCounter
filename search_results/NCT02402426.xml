      The overall goal of this project is to identify, assess and longitudinally monitor subjects&#xD;
      who are interested in participating in brain research. Participants will enroll through the&#xD;
      website, BrainHealthRegistry.org, and provide informed consent prior to any study activities.&#xD;
      The website will collect a variety of information, including participants' overall health,&#xD;
      memory complaints, family history of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), mood status,&#xD;
      sleep, diet, and exercise-all through self-reported online questionnaires. Participants will&#xD;
      also be ask to take online cognitive tests, and to return to the website at regular&#xD;
      intervals, to complete follow-up questionnaires and neuropsychological assessments. Everyone&#xD;
      over the age of 18 is welcome to participate. To join the Brain Health Registry, please visit&#xD;
      www.BrainHealthRegistry.org.&#xD;

      Through advertisement and community outreach, potential participants will be directed to the&#xD;
      website, BrainHealthRegistry.org. The overall goal of this project is to identify, assess and&#xD;
      longitudinally monitor subjects who are interested in participating in brain research.&#xD;
      Participants will enroll through the website, BrainHealthRegistry.org, and provide informed&#xD;
      consent prior to any study activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The website will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Information about the Brain Health Registry (who is eligible to participate, the goals&#xD;
           of the project and other relevant information about investigators and sponsors involved&#xD;
           in the Initiative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) such as &quot;How will my information be used?&quot;, &quot;How will&#xD;
           patient information be safeguarded?&quot;, &quot;What information will be requested?&quot;, &quot;How much&#xD;
           time will be required for registration and testing?&quot; will be addressed for participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. General information about Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
           discussed in lay terms Links to sites that may be of interest to participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Login to our secure Registry website&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registry will be a large, online database of volunteers who are interested in&#xD;
      participating in neuroscience research. While anyone over the age of 18 is welcome to join&#xD;
      the Registry, the intent is to concentrate all efforts on enrolling participants age 55 years&#xD;
      and older. It will consist of online tools and databases, which are HIPAA-compliant and&#xD;
      secure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will access the Registry by going to the BHR website,&#xD;
           BrainHealthRegistry.org&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants will provide their email address and create an account and username with&#xD;
           the Registry&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Registry will send an automatic email to the participant to verify their email&#xD;
           address&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants will read the online Information Sheet and will be asked to provide their&#xD;
           consent by clicking either &quot;I consent&quot; or &quot;I decline.&quot; Participants who decline to&#xD;
           participate in the Registry will be automatically directed out of the Registry website&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participants who give their consent will be permitted to continue through the&#xD;
           registration process, which includes completing a battery of questionnaires designed to&#xD;
           obtain a general understanding of participants health, medical history wellbeing&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. In addition to questionnaires, participants will be able to complete online cognitive&#xD;
           assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Participants will given the option to elect a Caregiver and/or Study Partner (CASP) to&#xD;
           enrich their study profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Participants may be referred to other research studies and/or clinical trials&#xD;
