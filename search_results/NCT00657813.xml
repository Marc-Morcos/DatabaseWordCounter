  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this proposal are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the dynamic uptake and washout of 123-I MNI-330, a potential imaging biomarker for&#xD;
      β-amyloid burden in brain, using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in&#xD;
      similarly aged Alzheimer's (AD) subjects and healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform blood metabolite characterization of 123-I MNI-330 in healthy and AD subjects to&#xD;
      determine the metabolic fate and nature of metabolites in assessment of 123-I MNI-330 as a&#xD;
      single photon computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the test/retest reproducibility of 123-I MNI-330 and SPECT in AD subjects and&#xD;
      healthy controls&#xD;

      The underlying goal of this study is to assess 123-I MNI-330 SPECT imaging as a tool to&#xD;
      detect ß-amyloid deposition in the brain of AD research participants and age- and&#xD;
      gender-matched healthy subjects. All study procedures will be conducted at the Institute for&#xD;
      Neurodegenerative Disorders (IND) and Molecular NeuroImaging (MNI) in New Haven, CT.&#xD;
      Approximately 10 patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) and 6 healthy controls (within +/- 2&#xD;
      years) will be recruited to participate in this study. Healthy controls will be examined to&#xD;
      ensure that there is no evidence of neurodegenerative changes including cognitive decline.&#xD;
