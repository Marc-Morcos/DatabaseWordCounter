  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between cortical hyperexcitability,&#xD;
      abnormalities of brain network function, and cognitive dysfunction in human patients with AD&#xD;
      and whether administration of the antiepileptic medication levetiracetam (LEV) normalizes&#xD;
      these measures and improves cognition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study. Participants with early Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease (AD) will be tested in a double-blind crossover design with placebo, low-dose&#xD;
      levetiracetam (LEV) 125 mg twice daily or high-dose LEV 500mg twice daily. These results will&#xD;
      be contrasted with results from a demographically similar control group who will undergo&#xD;
      baseline testing only, without any intervention, to establish a comparison norm for the AD&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo four screening and baseline visits consisting of a baseline&#xD;
      neurological, medical, and cognitive evaluation. If amyloid status is unknown in AD patients,&#xD;
      the participant will have an amyloid PET scan. Additional baseline measures include: a high&#xD;
      density electroencephalogram (EEG); a 24 hour ambulatory EEG; functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI); neuropsychological testing; and transcranial magnetic stimulation with&#xD;
      electromyogram (EMG) and EEG measures to assess cortical excitability. AD participants will&#xD;
      be randomized to one of six possible groups that consists of a varying order of 3 treatment&#xD;
      periods (LEV 125 mg, LEV 500 mg and placebo). The group assignments will be counterbalanced&#xD;
      across subjects. Each treatment period will last for 4 weeks with a 4 week washout between&#xD;
      treatments. All participants will be assessed prior to initiation of a treatment period (with&#xD;
      the initial assessment occurring as part of the baseline assessment) and at the end of each&#xD;
      treatment period. The following measures will be repeated as done at baseline at these time&#xD;
      points: fMRI; neuropsychological testing; and TMS-EMG-EEG. AD participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      for approximately 5 months.&#xD;
