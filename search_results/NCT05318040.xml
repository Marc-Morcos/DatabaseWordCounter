      This is a randomized, double-blind study of CMS121 or placebo given as single and multiple&#xD;
      escalating doses in normal healthy subjects. The study will be conducted in 4 parts: Part 1&#xD;
      will be a SAD study enrolling approximately 48 young subjects for a total duration of 36&#xD;
      days. Part 2 will be a MAD study enrolling approximately 32 young subjects for a total&#xD;
      duration of 43 days, and Part 3 will be a MAD study enrolling approximately 8 elderly&#xD;
      subjects for 43 days. Part 4 will be an open-label SAD cross-over cohort of approximately 12&#xD;
      young subjects in a fed or fasted state to evaluate the effect of food on the bioavailability&#xD;
      of CMS121, for a duration of 36 days.&#xD;
