  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single center, open-label, non-randomized, clinical study in probable AD&#xD;
      patients and HVs to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a single dose of&#xD;
      MNI-672. The underlying goal of this study is to assess MNI-672 SPECT imaging as a tool to&#xD;
      detect ß amyloid deposition in the brain of AD research participants and young healthy male&#xD;
      subjects. All study procedures will be conducted at Molecular NeuroImaging (MNI) in New&#xD;
      Haven, CT. Approximately 3 patients with AD and 3 young male HVs will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in this study. HVs will be screened to ensure that there is no evidence of&#xD;
      cognitive decline or significant neurological deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible subjects will be required to visit the study center on at least 2 occasions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. for one or more screening visits which should include a history and physical&#xD;
           examination, laboratory and extensive neuro-psychological testing and MRI brain&#xD;
           scanning. AD subjects will also undergo Amyvid PET imaging as part of the Screening&#xD;
           Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. on one day for baseline examinations and MNI-672 administration and subsequent SPECT&#xD;
           scanning- followed by safety measures&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine diagnostic efficacy of the MNI-672 SPECT scans in differentiating between&#xD;
      patients with probable AD and HVs on the basis of neocortical tracer binding pattern, the&#xD;
      SPECT scans will be visually assessed by a nuclear physician experienced in the field of&#xD;
      neuro-imaging. SPECT scan findings will be classified either as abnormal (i.e., significant&#xD;
      neocortical uptake in predefined regions) or as normal (i.e. no significant neocortical&#xD;
      uptake in predefined regions). The visual analysis of the MNI SPECT images will be compared&#xD;
      to the clinical diagnosis and Amyvid PET imaging results to determine the efficacy of MNI-672&#xD;
      as an agent to detect B-amyloid. The nuclear physician evaluating the SPECT images will be&#xD;
      unaware of the clinical diagnosis.&#xD;
