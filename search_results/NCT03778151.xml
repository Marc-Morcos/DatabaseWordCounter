    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is a global health challenge. Efforts aim at developing an effective&#xD;
      treatment able to meet the needs of patients and their families. Thus, the primary aim of&#xD;
      this project is to investigate the efficacy of a non-invasive brain stimulation, namely&#xD;
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), on cognition in patients with mild&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. rTMS is considered a safe, well tolerated and relatively cheap&#xD;
      treatment. The appealing idea of the intervention is to improve memory by directly modulating&#xD;
      the activity of precuneus, key area linked to memory impairment. Patients will be treated&#xD;
      with rTMS in two phases: an intensive phase and a maintenance phase for a total of six&#xD;
      months. This project aims to provide a valid treatment to slow the worsening of symptoms and&#xD;
      improve quality of life for those with Alzheimer's and their caregivers.&#xD;

      Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe&#xD;
      disruption of large-scale brain networks connectivity. AD pathophysiology has been mainly&#xD;
      associated with a breakdown of the Default Mode Network (DMN) and with a structural&#xD;
      disconnection of parietal nodes. It has been shown that the precuneus (PC), a central hub of&#xD;
      the DMN, is involved in successful episodic memory retrieval, working as a key area of the&#xD;
      network activated by recognition memory. Recent anatomical works have shown that medial&#xD;
      parietal regions are interconnected with the medial temporal region, which is implicated in&#xD;
      memory retrieval. In particular, the PC was identified as a region demonstrating strong&#xD;
      functional interconnectivity with the hippocampal formation. This is of particular relevance&#xD;
      because PC is altered in AD. At early clinical stages of AD, PC is selectively vulnerable to&#xD;
      early amyloid deposition, and plays a critical role in the conversion towards dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: a novel therapeutic intervention for AD is repetitive Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (rTMS). rTMS is a non- invasive approach that can be used to induce long lasting&#xD;
      modulation of specific brain functions, inducing neuroplastic changes not only in the&#xD;
      cortical site of stimulation, but also in remote interconnected areas. In a recent double&#xD;
      blind randomized cross-over clinical pilot study, we found that a two-week course of daily&#xD;
      high-frequency rTMS (20 Hz) treatment targeting the DMN (Stimulation site: PC) was able to&#xD;
      induce an improvement in episodic memory compared to placebo. Indeed, TMS-EEG measurements&#xD;
      showed that rTMS treatment, applied over the DMN, was capable to modulate the cortical&#xD;
      activity in both the targeted areas (PC) as well as in functional connected regions of the&#xD;
      DMN (Koch et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims: to investigate clinical efficacy and safety of DMN rTMS applied during 6&#xD;
      months in mild AD patients. To provide novel evidence that non-invasive treatment of network&#xD;
      dysfunction, through stimulation of the PC, will represent an effective strategy to enhance&#xD;
      cognitive functions and lead to substantial slowing of cognitive and functional decline in&#xD;
      patients with mild AD. The findings yielded by the present project will have a potential&#xD;
      strong impact on clinical practice of AD patients. Since rTMS is well tolerated and&#xD;
      relatively low-priced, a positive result could lead to a fast application of the present&#xD;
      proposal to the clinical experience. If successful, the proposed project will provide support&#xD;
      for a novel treatment for cognitive dysfunction in AD patients.&#xD;
