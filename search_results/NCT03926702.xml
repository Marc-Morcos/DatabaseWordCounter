  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to assess the utility of a new positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical to image tau, [18F] JNJ067, invented by Janssen Pharmaceutical companies&#xD;
      of Johnson &amp; Johnson. To date, the radiopharmaceutical has been used in a small group of&#xD;
      patients and controls (&lt;20). The study plans to expand the range and number of subjects, to&#xD;
      examine a total of 18 participants including controls and patients with Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (AD) and other dementias. All patients will be recruited from the University of California,&#xD;
      San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center (MAC) and controls will be recruited from the&#xD;
      University of California, Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS). Patients will undergo a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary clinical evaluation for diagnosis and a cognitive assessment at the MAC;&#xD;
      controls will undergo the usual BACS cognitive assessment performed on the Berkeley campus.&#xD;
      Following these evaluations UCSF subjects will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      scanning at the UCSF Neuroimaging Center and blood sampling for genetic testing also at UCSF,&#xD;
      and BACS subjects will undergo an MRI at the University of California Berkeley 3T Brain&#xD;
      Imaging Center (in Li Ka Shing hall on the Berkeley campus) and blood sampling for genetic&#xD;
      testing at the time of the PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will come to Lawrence Berkeley National Law (LBNL) where they will have, on the&#xD;
      same day, a C-11 Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) PET scan to measure brain amyloid, and an F-18&#xD;
      JNJ067 PET scan to measure brain tau. These scans will be examined and analyzed by LBNL&#xD;
      staff, and data will be processed to examine basic questions about the quantitative behavior&#xD;
      of JNJ067. Scan results will not be returned to control subjects, but physicians at UCSF will&#xD;
      receive scan results on MAC patients and will share results with participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this protocol, the investigators also plan to share the acquired data widely. All&#xD;
      data will be de-identified. Data will be shared with the inventors (Janssen/Johnson &amp;&#xD;
      Johnson) as well as other scientists worldwide. As this is a new radio tracer, the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate that there will be interest in seeing the actual data to answer&#xD;
      questions about uptake and application of the method in future studies in many different&#xD;
      laboratories. Shared data will include PET scans, MRI scans, genetic testing, and&#xD;
      neuropsychological results.&#xD;
