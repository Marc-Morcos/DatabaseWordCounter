      The incidence of AD dementia is increasing due to the aging population, putting a heavy&#xD;
      burden on our society and economics. Exploring the mechanisms underlying SCD due to&#xD;
      preclinical AD has scientific and clinical significance. However, it is challenging to&#xD;
      construct and validate the preclinical diagnosis model of AD with fused multimodel&#xD;
      information across culture/race. From the cooperation during the past five years, we have&#xD;
      established cohorts by synchronized assessment, achieved consensus on SCD features extraction&#xD;
      and made a breakthrough in the application of multiple parameter MRI with German&#xD;
      collaborators. Therefore, in this project, SCD with and without amyloid pathology will be&#xD;
      compared by clinical and cognitive data, genetics, blood and MRI biomarkers between the&#xD;
      German and Chinese. Key features will be extracted and specific characteristics of SCD due to&#xD;
      preclinical AD as well as risk factors for conversion between two countries will be&#xD;
      clarified. Then the diagnosis model of preclinical AD in SCD will be established across&#xD;
      culture/race based on radiogenomics, which will improve the current diagnostic system of AD.&#xD;
      Through this project, the value of SCD in the etiologic, anatomical and quantitative&#xD;
      diagnosis of preclinical AD will be identified to improve sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      preclinical AD diagnosis in clinical practice.&#xD;

      The overall prevalence of dementia worldwide is increasing, imposing a heavy burden on the&#xD;
      public and health care systems. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), characterized by a&#xD;
      self-report of decline in cognitive function without objective impairment in&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessments, is considered a high risk factor for AD. SCD with&#xD;
      amyloidopathy is considered as a first symptomatic indicator of the preclinical AD (SCD due&#xD;
      to preclinical AD). However, how to construct and validate the preclinical diagnosis model of&#xD;
      AD with fused multimodel information across culture/race remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, all SCD participants from Germany and China will be conducted amyloid&#xD;
      PET scanning, and they will be classified into two groups (SCD with amyloid+ and SCD with&#xD;
      amyloid-) based on whether there is the evidence of amyloid deposition. The investigators&#xD;
      will compare the clinical information, genetics, blood and multiple parameter MRI data&#xD;
      between the German and Chinese to evaluate the common and specific features from different&#xD;
      culture/race. Then, key features associated with amyloid deposition will be extracted for the&#xD;
      establisment of diagnosis model of SCD due to preclinical AD, which will improve the current&#xD;
      diagnostic system of AD. After four-year follow-up, SCD will be classified into SCD converter&#xD;
      group and SCD non-converter group. Risk factors for conversion to cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      dementia will be further extracted as predicted biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this project, the value of SCD in the etiologic, anatomical and quantitative&#xD;
      diagnosis of preclinical AD will be identified to improve sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      preclinical AD diagnosis in clinical practice.&#xD;

    <description>SCD with the evidence of brain amyloid deposition is considered as preclinical AD. The investigators aim to extract multiple features involving neuroimaging, gene sequencing, blood, and clinical data to identify individuals with amyloid+ from SCD persons. These features associated with amyloid deposition are valuable biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD.</description>

    <description>In this study, the participants are from two research centers in China and Germany. All participants will conduct amyloid PET scanning, after which they are classified into two grous (SCD with amyloid+ and SCD with amyloid-). SCD subjects with positive amyloid show the evidence of amyloid deposition in brain. They have higher risk of conversion to mild cognitive impairment and dementia compared with SCD with negative amyloid. They are also considered as preclinical AD.</description>

    <description>In the present study, the &quot;gold standard&quot; of preclinical AD is amyloid PET. SCD with positive amyloid is the target population for early AD intervention. The investigators aim to extract the diagnostic features from multiple parameter MRI, genetic, blood and clinical data using Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR) algorithm. Then, based on support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and multi-kernel learning (MKL) classification methods, the investigators will construct predicted diagnostic model of preclinical AD.</description>

        SCD may serve as a first symptomatic indicator during the preclinical stage of AD. SCD with&#xD;
        amyloidopathy had a risk of progressing to AD dementia. In this study, all participants&#xD;
        from two centers in Germany and China will be classified into two groups (SCD with amyloid+&#xD;
        and SCD with amyloid-) based on the amyloid PET. In addition, the participants will conduct&#xD;
        multiple parameter MRI scanning, clinical data collection, blood biomarkers and gene&#xD;
        examination. The investigators aim to reveal the common risk factors associated with&#xD;
        amyloid deposition based on clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic information from two&#xD;
        countries.&#xD;
