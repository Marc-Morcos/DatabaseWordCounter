    <textblock>
      Project Summary Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with the development of diabetes and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease; however it is also linked with cognitive decline and dementia. The&#xD;
      study investigators have shown that MetS is associated with lower cerebral blood flow (CBF)&#xD;
      and memory function in late middle-aged adults at increased risk for developing Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD). Insulin resistance (IR) is at the core of MetS, and a hallmark feature of IR is&#xD;
      higher fasting blood glucose (FBG) as well as post prandial hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the study investigators and others have demonstrated links between IR and CBF as well&#xD;
      as cognition from an observational perspective, no studies have investigated CBF and&#xD;
      cognition after an intervention involving exercise and a carbohydrate restricted diet (CRD)&#xD;
      designed to improve or normalize IR and glucose homeostasis. The study investigators propose&#xD;
      to determine the effect of improving or normalizing glucose homeostasis on CBF and cognition,&#xD;
      through diet and exercise, in individuals with IR and at risk for the development of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While exercise and a CRD have been shown to improve IR and glycemic control, we have only&#xD;
      limited knowledge of the mechanisms behind these improvements. Nutritional metabolomics, the&#xD;
      global measurement and interpretation of metabolic profiles, assesses the interaction of diet&#xD;
      with the endogenous gene-protein cascade and the gut microbiome. Additionally, exercise has&#xD;
      been shown to have an impact on the human metabolome. Finally, numerous metabolites have been&#xD;
      specifically linked to IR and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). The study investigators propose&#xD;
      to use metabolomics to measure changes in metabolites as individuals normalize or improve IR&#xD;
      and glucose homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should this exploratory study reveal increased brain blood flow and improved memory in&#xD;
      response to diet and exercise, then early treatment of these individuals at risk might offer&#xD;
      new avenues for disease-course modification. Strategies towards early and effective risk&#xD;
      factor management could be of value in reducing the risk of metabolic as well as cognitive&#xD;
      decline. In addition, should this study reveal changes in metabolic abnormalities consistent&#xD;
      with early indications of diabetes, metabolomics could be an effective approach to complement&#xD;
      disease risk analysis in our goal toward precision care.&#xD;

      Research Strategy Design. The study investigators propose recruiting 40 middle-aged (45-65&#xD;
      years) participants from the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center's (ADRC) &quot;IMPACT&quot;&#xD;
      cohort to participate in a 12 week diet and exercise intervention with a 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
      The Wisconsin ADRC has a special emphasis in preclinical AD, and participants are recruited&#xD;
      with the expectation of being approached for intervention studies. Since the treatment will&#xD;
      be applied to groups of 10 participants each, consisting of a total of 4 groups, the study&#xD;
      investigators will not be able simultaneously to roll out the treatment program in all&#xD;
      groups. Subsequently, an incomplete stepped wedge cluster randomized trial (SWCRT)48,49 will&#xD;
      be considered. The design allows each block (intervention group) to be randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention in a stepped fashion, initially providing a baseline measure, as indicate by '0'&#xD;
      in the design matrix below, then followed by the 12 week intervention 'X' with '.' indicating&#xD;
      no measurement, and '1a' indicating measurement post-12 week diet and exercise intervention&#xD;
      and '1b' 6 months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time 1 Time 2 Time 3 Time 4 Time 5 Time 6 Time 7 Group 1 0 X 1a 1b . . . Group 2 . 0 X 1a 1b&#xD;
      . . Group 3 . . 0 X 1a 1b . Group 4 . . . 0 X 1a 1b&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline. It is anticipated that after recruitment and random assignment to one of the 4&#xD;
      groups, baseline data collection and the 12 week intervention will begin for the first group&#xD;
      in month 3 of the 24 month study. Baseline data collection will be completed for all groups&#xD;
      by month 12, and post 12-week diet and exercise intervention data collection will be&#xD;
      completed by month 15. Post 6 month follow-up data collection will be completed by month 20.&#xD;
      The study investigators will share the results of baseline and follow-up findings in&#xD;
      manuscripts and at national meetings, in addition to using the generated data to design a&#xD;
      larger intervention trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. The study investigators will recruit 40 sedentary (exercise &lt;1 hour/week)&#xD;
      participants who are 45-65 years of age, have impaired fasting glucose and are cognitively&#xD;
      normal (based on the comprehensive ADRC battery). The cohort has received detailed annual&#xD;
      medical and cognitive evaluation since enrolling in the Wisconsin ADRC. The cohort is&#xD;
      well-characterized for health status and medication use, has undergone genotyping AD-related&#xD;
      risk genes, and has banked fluid samples and DNA. Importantly, participants are characterized&#xD;
      on metabolic risk, with slightly more than half meeting criteria for central obesity and/or&#xD;
      elevated fasting glucose. Exclusion criteria are: active lifestyle (exercise &gt;1 hour/wk);&#xD;
      body mass index &gt; 40; MRI contraindications; history of neurological disease, prior&#xD;
      neurosurgery; diagnosed and/or treated type 1 or 2 diabetes; pregnancy; acute or subacute&#xD;
      active cardiac disease (ongoing chest pain or myocardial infarction &lt; 3 months); significant&#xD;
      orthopedic or musculoskeletal condition that limits weight bearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility, Screening and Testing. Following IRB approval, a study coordinator will send an&#xD;
      invitation letter describing the study to eligible participants previously identified via&#xD;
      fasting glucose levels as pre-diabetic. Interested participants will be contacted by the&#xD;
      study coordinator for further eligibility screening. Exercise testing will take place at the&#xD;
      School of Nursing Exercise Physiology Laboratory. After an overnight fast, participants will&#xD;
      arrive in the morning at the Clinical Research Unit to have blood samples collected for&#xD;
      Metabolomics, A1C, glucose and insulin, receive cognitive testing, and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI). Participants will undergo MRI at the Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research&#xD;
      (WIMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      12-Week Diet and Exercise Intervention. The intervention is based on the research team's&#xD;
      successful prior work in behavioral interventions. During the 12-week intervention, all&#xD;
      participants will participate in a diet and exercise program. Exercise: Participants will&#xD;
      attend a supervised exercise program, 10 subjects per group meeting 3x/wk. The program will&#xD;
      begin with exercise for 20 minutes at a moderate intensity (determined during initial&#xD;
      exercise testing). After week 2, exercise will be increased to 30 minutes; and after week 3,&#xD;
      exercise will be increased to 50 minutes, resulting in 150 minutes of supervised exercise&#xD;
      weekly. Exercise will be preceded by a 10 minute warm-up and a 10 minute cool down following&#xD;
      exercise. The exercise classes will be held at the University of Wisconsin Natatorium, which&#xD;
      includes stationary bikes, treadmills, elliptical machines, etc. Participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to exercise on their own for 30-50 minutes at least 2 days/week for a total of 5&#xD;
      days/week of exercise. Participants will be provided with heart rate monitors and instruction&#xD;
      on how to use them to maintain a target heart rate during exercise. Anaerobic threshold&#xD;
      measured during baseline testing will be used initially to determine target heart rate, but&#xD;
      participants will be monitored every other week during the exercise sessions using heart rate&#xD;
      variability techniques published by the Co-PI, R. Gretebeck to adjust for improvements in&#xD;
      exercise capacity. Diet: Participants will be instructed by a dietitian (Co-PI, Dr. R.&#xD;
      Gretebeck) to follow a diet designed to reduce post prandial and overall glucose levels. The&#xD;
      American Diabetes Association approves the use of a CRD in overweight or obese individuals,&#xD;
      but cautions that this approach should be limited to one year. There is no consensus on the&#xD;
      definition of a CRD, but most studies have used diets providing between 30-100g of&#xD;
      carbohydrates per day accompanied with a moderate amount of protein (15-30% of calories),&#xD;
      with fats providing the rest of daily energy requirements. For this study, participants will&#xD;
      be instructed to avoid or restrict grains, sugars, legumes, starchy vegetables, and fruits.&#xD;
      Carbohydrate from dairy, condiments, nuts and seeds etc. will not be limited, resulting in a&#xD;
      diet that is not considered severely restricted and thus easier to follow, but still less&#xD;
      than 100g of carbohydrates per day. In concrete terms, most meals will include some source of&#xD;
      animal protein including dairy products with non-starchy vegetables and fat from sources such&#xD;
      as olive oil, avocado, nuts, butter and cheese. Behavior Change: The dietitian (who is also&#xD;
      an exercise physiologist) and Co-I, K. Gretebeck, behavior change expert, will conduct a&#xD;
      weekly 30-minute behavior change class with the focus on self-regulation (goal setting,&#xD;
      self-monitoring, relapse prevention, overcoming barriers, etc.) to promote diet and exercise&#xD;
      adherence. Specific emphasis will be placed on glucose self-monitoring for immediate feedback&#xD;
      of glycemic control. Building on the behavior change classes, the study investigators will&#xD;
      use glucose self-monitoring as an immediate feedback loop to motivate participants to&#xD;
      maintain normalized or improved glucose homeostasis through diet and exercise. Following the&#xD;
      12-week diet and exercise intervention, participants will continue to self-monitor their&#xD;
      blood glucose, and continue the diet and exercise program on their own. After the 12 week&#xD;
      intervention, investigators will meet with participants monthly to collect blood and urine&#xD;
      for metabolomics, and download the glucose history from the glucose monitors. The following&#xD;
      objective measures will be used to assess adherence to the lifestyle intervention: history of&#xD;
      glycemic control from glucose monitors, HOMA-IR, exercise capacity (V02 max), 6 minute walk,&#xD;
      and metabolomic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose Self-Monitoring. Participants will be provided with glucose monitors that maintain a&#xD;
      history of results for fasting and post prandial blood glucose. During the first 2 weeks of&#xD;
      the 12 week intervention, participants will be instructed to monitor their fasting and post&#xD;
      prandial (evening meal) blood glucose daily, and after week 2 every other day, with the goal&#xD;
      or reaching a FBG &lt;100 mg/dl (&lt;86 ideal), and 2 hour post-prandial blood glucose &lt;140 mg/dl&#xD;
      (&lt;120 ideal). After the goal has been reached, participants will be asked to continue to&#xD;
      self-monitor weekly. It is anticipated that many participants will reach this goal within the&#xD;
      first 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes. CBF (measured at baseline, after the 12 week intervention and after 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up). All participants will be screened for contraindications to MRI using standard&#xD;
      clinical screening questionnaires. Participants will undergo MRI on a 3.0 Tesla X750 GE&#xD;
      Discovery scanner with an 8-channel array head coil. Scan time is ~45 minutes and will&#xD;
      include scans relevant to the primary outcome measure of micro- and macro-vessel CBF.&#xD;
      Additional scans will include a 3D T1-weighted volume, and T2 FLAIR to assess ischemic lesion&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognition (measured at baseline, after the 12 week intervention and after 6 month follow-up).&#xD;
      Memory and executive function will be measured as follows: 1) Memory function as indexed by&#xD;
      the California Verbal Learning Test-II: learning slope for trials 1-5 and long delay&#xD;
      retention57, and 2) Executive function as indexed by: the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function&#xD;
      System Trails Test, and Color-Word Interference Test58. Also, participants will be fully&#xD;
      characterized on cognitive function by the ADRC, including the National Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Coordinating Center Uniform Dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomics. Fasting blood and urine (second void of the morning) samples will be collected&#xD;
      before and after the 12 week diet and exercise intervention as well as every 2 weeks during&#xD;
      the 12 week intervention, and monthly during 6 month follow-up. Our project will use the&#xD;
      metabolomics database developed at the NMRFAM at UW-Madison and made freely available through&#xD;
      the BMRB59 at (www.bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Measures at baseline, after the 12 week intervention and after 6 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Capacity (VO2max) will be measured using treadmill walking at 3.0 mph for 3 minute&#xD;
      stages progressing potentially through 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15% grades of incline. Every 3&#xD;
      minutes the grade will be increased until the participants reach volitional fatigue. Heart&#xD;
      rate and respiratory gases will be monitored continuously, and blood pressure and blood&#xD;
      lactate (finger prick) will be monitored at the end of each stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Function (6 minute walk). Participants will be instructed to cover as much ground as&#xD;
      possible on a hallway course over 6 minutes. 6 minute walk is measured in feet walked over 6&#xD;
      minutes65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Status. Fasting glucose, insulin, and A1c will be measured by University of WI&#xD;
      Clinical Research Unit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet and Exercise Self-efficacy and Self-regulation. Validated questionaires for&#xD;
      self-regulation66 and self-efficacy67 for physical activity will be utilized, and a&#xD;
      questionnaire developed by Anderson et. al.68 for nutrition related behavior will adapted for&#xD;
      use with a CRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose Monitoring. Participants will receive a ReliOn® Ultima (Abbott Diabetes Care Inc)&#xD;
      glucose monitor and test strips, which meets FDA standards for accuracy (+20%). See&#xD;
      description above for glucose self-monitoring. Data from the glucose monitors will be&#xD;
      downloaded before, every 2 weeks during the 12 week intervention, and monthly for 6 months.&#xD;
