  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of risperidone (an&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication) versus placebo for the treatment of patients with hallucinations&#xD;
      and delusions associated with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is frequently observed in the elderly, often associated with psychotic symptoms such&#xD;
      as delusion or hallucination, or with behavioral disturbances such as aggressive behavior,&#xD;
      wandering, and aimless behavior induced by the psychotic symptoms. Based on the results of&#xD;
      preliminary clinical studies, risperidone can be expected to be beneficial for the treatment&#xD;
      of psychotic symptoms and behavioral disturbances associated with Alzheimer's disease. This&#xD;
      is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of risperidone tablets&#xD;
      or placebo tablets taken twice daily over 9 weeks by patients with hallucinations and&#xD;
      delusions associated with Alzheimer's disease. During the one week run-in period, patients&#xD;
      take one tablet twice daily. During the 8 week double-blind period, the dose is given twice&#xD;
      daily in a flexible dose regimen of 0.5 to 2 mg of risperidone per day, or placebo. The&#xD;
      primary measure of effectiveness is the change in Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      (BEHAVE-AD) psychotic symptom cluster score from baseline and intermediate visits to study&#xD;
      end (Week 9) compared with placebo. BEHAVE-AD is a scale used for global assessment of&#xD;
      symptoms associated with dementia. Additional assessments of effectiveness include the&#xD;
      Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), an assessment of aggressiveness and&#xD;
      non-aggressiveness, and the Clinical Global Impression - Change (CGI-C), a measure of an&#xD;
      improved or aggravated condition. Safety evaluations include the incidence of adverse events,&#xD;
      physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology,&#xD;
      and urinalysis), and assessment of extrapyramidal symptoms. The study hypothesis is that&#xD;
      treatment twice daily with risperidone is more effective than placebo on measures of the&#xD;
      BEHAVE-AD psychotic symptom cluster score in patients with hallucinations and delusions&#xD;
      associated with Alzheimer's disease. Oral risperidone tablets 0.25 mg or placebo tablets&#xD;
      twice daily, increasing in weekly increments of 0.5 mg/day to a maximum of 2 mg/day; total&#xD;
      daily dosage will be maintained for 9 weeks.&#xD;
