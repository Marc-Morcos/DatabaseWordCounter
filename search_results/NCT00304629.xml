      The long-term safety and efficacy of galantamine (12 mg bid) will be documented during a one&#xD;
      year open-label treatment in subjects with Alzheimer's Disease who completed the GAL-INT-8&#xD;
      trial (up to 400 eligible patients). Safety will be tracked by means of adverse event&#xD;
      reports, laboratory parameters and physical exam. Long-term efficacy will be evaluated by&#xD;
      means of a Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale(ADAS) and activities of daily living scale&#xD;
      Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale(DAD)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a twelve-month, open-label trial in which treatment with 12 mg bid galantamine will&#xD;
      be evaluated. Only subjects who took trial medication during the 24-month trial period of&#xD;
      GAL-INT-8 will be eligible. Safety will be assessed by periodic physical examination, vital&#xD;
      signs, ECG and laboratory tests and reports of adverse events. The ADAS-cognitive scale and&#xD;
      DAD scale will be used to document long-term efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen at 6 monthly intervals but the ADAS-cognitive scale and DAD scale will&#xD;
      only be performed at end of trial. The treatment will consist of tablets which will contain&#xD;
      12 mg of galantamine. Duration of treatment equals 12 months. Patients will receive 1 tablet&#xD;
      twice daily preferably to be taken with food (breakfast in the morning at approximately 8 AM&#xD;
      and a snack or meal in the evening at approximately 6PM).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have taken trial medication during the 24-month trial period of&#xD;
             GAL-INT-8 and should be enrolled within 1 month after completion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and their primary caregiver give informed consent for the participation in&#xD;
             the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have remained in good health, as determined by medical history, complete&#xD;
             physical examination and laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a patient developed, during the trial GAL-INT-8, symptoms of other neurological or&#xD;
             psychiatric diseases that might contribute to dementia, the subject cannot be&#xD;
             enrolled. This includes subjects developing neurodegenerative disorders such as&#xD;
             Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease or Huntington's chorea, or Creutzfeldt-Jacob&#xD;
             disease, and subjects with cognitive impairment resulting from stroke, acute cerebral&#xD;
             trauma, hypoxic cerebral damage, infection or primary or metastatic cerebral neoplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with the following co-existing medical conditions: a) Any history of epilepsy&#xD;
             or convulsions except for febrile convulsions during childhood b) Peptic ulcer: if the&#xD;
             ulcer is considered to be still &quot;active&quot;, i.e., if treatment for this condition&#xD;
             started &lt;3 months ago or if treatment is not successful (symptoms still present), the&#xD;
             subject is not eligible. c) Clinically significant hepatic, renal, pulmonary,&#xD;
             metabolic or endocrine disturbances&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with current, clinically significant cardiovascular disease that would be&#xD;
             expected to limit the subject's ability to complete a 12-month trial. The following&#xD;
             would usually be considered clinically significant cardiovascular disease: a) Unstable&#xD;
             angina&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  angina or coronary artery disease that required a change in medication (anti-angina or&#xD;
             digitalis) within the last 3 months b) Decompensated congestive heart failure i.e.&#xD;
             when symptoms occur in a subject on stable medication during rest or light exercise&#xD;
             (NYHA III and IV). Note: if the only signs of decompensation are pretibial or&#xD;
             malleolar oedema and the exercise tolerance is still reasonable (absence of dyspnoea)&#xD;
             the subject should not be excluded c) Cardiac disease potentially resulting in&#xD;
             syncope, near syncope or other alterations of mental status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition, the following conditions should lead to exclusion: atrial fibrillation&#xD;
             without prophylactic treatment to prevent thromboembolic stroke, bradycardia &lt;50&#xD;
             beats/min., atrioventricular block &gt; first degree. d) Severe mitral or aortic valvular&#xD;
             disease e) Hypotension or treatment for hypotension f) Systolic blood pressure greater&#xD;
             than 170 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using any agent for the treatment of dementia (approved, experimental,&#xD;
             including over the counter agents), including, but not limited to nootropic agents,&#xD;
             cholinomimetic agents, choline, oestrogens taken without medical need, chronic NSAIDs&#xD;
             (30 consecutive days), vitamin E more than 30 IU daily, and deprenyl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conditions that could interfere with the absorption of the compound or with the&#xD;
             evaluation of the disease&#xD;
