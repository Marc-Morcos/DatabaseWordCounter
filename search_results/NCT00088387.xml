    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of the drugs lithium and divalproex (Depakote) on tau&#xD;
      proteins, a type of protein in the brain and spinal fluid that are altered in patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. Both drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat&#xD;
      mood disorders, and both have been shown in animal studies to decrease the amount of altered&#xD;
      tau protein. This study will determine whether lithium alone or in combination with&#xD;
      divalproex reduces the altered tau protein in the spinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Alzheimer's disease who are between 40 and 90 years of age may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination,&#xD;
      neurologic and neuropsychological evaluation, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram (EKG),&#xD;
      and, if needed, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug treatment: Patients take study drugs for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly clinic visits: Patients come to the clinic once a week for a physical&#xD;
           examination, blood and urine tests, a review of drug side effects, and to receive the&#xD;
           next week's supply of medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): Patients have a lumbar puncture at study weeks 2, 4, and 6&#xD;
           to measure various brain chemicals and tau proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),&#xD;
           which bathes the brain and spinal cord. For this test, a local anesthetic is given and a&#xD;
           needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF&#xD;
           circulates below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is collected through the&#xD;
           needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visit: Two weeks after completing the study medication, patients return to the&#xD;
           clinic for a final evaluation, including a physical examination and blood and urine&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to examine the acute effects of lithium alone and/or&#xD;
      in combination with divalproex on surrogate measures of neuroprotective activity in patients&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's disease. It is hypothesized that at safe and tolerable doses these drugs&#xD;
      will inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 activity and reduce the phosphorylated tau epitopes&#xD;
      threonine-181 and threonine-231 implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder. In this&#xD;
      proof-of-principle study, efficacy on reducing tau phosphorylated epitopes will be assessed&#xD;
      through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements. Safety will be monitored by means of frequent&#xD;
      clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is between the ages of 40 and 90 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient will have a diagnosis of AD; the study will be confined to patients who are able to&#xD;
        provide consent (pass a capacity assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The modified Hachinski Ischemia Score must be less than 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Brain MRI performed within 15 months of enrollment must be compatible with the diagnosis of&#xD;
        AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient and/or caregiver are willing to adhere to protocol requirements as evidenced by&#xD;
        written, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria during screening or during the&#xD;
        study will not be enrolled or will be immediately excluded from the study, as appropriate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient has a history of any medical condition that can reasonably be expected to subject&#xD;
        the patient to unwarranted risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient has clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that would preclude&#xD;
        administration of lithium and divalproex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is taking a prohibited concomitant medication. The following medications are&#xD;
        forbidden for at least one month prior to the treatment phase (unless otherwise noted) and&#xD;
        during the course of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any investigational drugs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Anti-depressants (eligibility will be considered as long as dosage remains stable&#xD;
        throughout the study);&#xD;
&#xD;
        Anticonvulsants and other mood stabilizing drugs;&#xD;
