  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are leading causes of disability and often&#xD;
      result in communication deficits of the person with dementia (PWD) that can complicate ADRD&#xD;
      caregiving and clinical care. The research team will work with stakeholders to develop and&#xD;
      design a personalized Assistive and Alternative Communication (AAC) device that relies on&#xD;
      information technology (IT) and touchscreens to promote communication and personhood for PWD&#xD;
      about their care preferences and experiences. This study will integrate the AAC into an&#xD;
      existing health IT intervention that already facilitates clinical communication between&#xD;
      caregivers and providers of PWD, called CareHeroes (CH). A clinical trial will be conducted&#xD;
      to evaluate outcomes of 120 triads (PWD/caregivers/providers) utilizing the CH intervention&#xD;
      as an adjunct to care and caregiving for 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The target enrollment for the clinical trial is 120 triads of health care providers,&#xD;
      caregivers, and people with dementia (PWD), where 120 unique dyads of caregivers/PWD will&#xD;
      participate and healthcare providers will participate in multiple triads. The team plans to&#xD;
      enroll 60 triads at each of the two participating clinical sites. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the full intervention or a minimal intervention for a period of&#xD;
      12 months, where they will be asked to communicate clinical and other relevant information&#xD;
      with one another as part of regular caregiving and clinical care activities. Several&#xD;
      psychosocial outcome variables for providers, caregivers, and PWD will be assessed. We will&#xD;
      compare outcomes based on group assignment and different amounts and patterns of use of CH&#xD;
      (e.g., minimal/non-users versus frequent users). The primary outcome variables are quality of&#xD;
      life for caregivers and PWD.&#xD;

    <description>The Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist, a 24-item caregiver-reported measure of observable memory difficulties and behavior problems in patients along with a parallel assessment of the caregiver's reaction to these behavioral problems. The checklist is a reliable and valid assessment that asks the caregiver to rate the frequency of care recipient problems (0 = never occurred to 4 = daily or more often) within three subscales (i.e., memory-related, depression, and disruptive behaviors). The caregiver rates the frequency of each behavior problem during the past week and his/her reaction to the behavior (i.e., how bothered or upset the caregiver feels when the behavior occurs [0 = not at all to 4 = extremely bothered]).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline,12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) is a validated and reliable depression severity measure. The 19-item tool has been validated to rate depression symptoms over the entire range of cognitive impairment. The CSDD is administered via 2 semi-structured interviews: 1 with an informant and 1 with the patient. A final decision regarding the presence or absence of symptoms is achieved by the clinician's judgment and integration of both sets of responses.</description>

It had been validated for community-dwelling, hospitalized, and institutionalized older adults. The GDS-15 has a yes-no format. Scores range from 0 to 15; the higher the score the more likely the individual is experiencing depression.</description>

    <description>CareHeroes (CH) is IT that addresses lack of caregiver support and education about ADRD care that often result in depression, burden, and low caregiving self-efficacy. The CH intervention provides caregivers with electronic and video-based educational materials, links to services, and self-assessments for depression and burden that offer feedback. It also allows the caregiver to assess symptoms of the PWD using clinical assessments, which can be shared with the provider. The clinical trial evaluates the impact of the addition of an AAC interface (e-communication board) to CareHereos that relies on touchscreen technology, pictures, and text to support PWD with communication deficits so that the PWD can engage and communicate about preferences and experiences with the caregiver and provider about their daily and clinical care. The minimal intervention group will only have access to a paper version of the AAC.</description>
