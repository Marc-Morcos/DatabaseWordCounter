    <textblock>
      The goal of this study will be to design, implement and test the impact of a quality&#xD;
      improvement (QI) intervention that uses an EHR CDS tool among physicians newly ordering an&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication for older adults with ADRD. The study team hypothesizes that the&#xD;
      intervention will reduce each participating clinician's pill days per patient prescribed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Importance: Among patients with Alzheimer's disease and its related dementias (ADRD) with&#xD;
      behavioral disturbances, antipsychotic prescriptions have limited efficacy and substantially&#xD;
      increase risk of death. Despite an FDA 2005 &quot;black box&quot; warning and multiple professional&#xD;
      physician society guidelines discouraging their use, physicians continue to frequently&#xD;
      prescribe antipsychotic medications as first-line therapy for behavioral disturbances among&#xD;
      patients with ADRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study will measure the impact of a multi-pronged electronic health record&#xD;
      (EHR) clinical decision support (CDS) tool intervention to reduce physician prescriptions of&#xD;
      new antipsychotic medications among older adults with ADRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, Setting, and Participants: Utilizing a pragmatic parallel cluster-randomized trial&#xD;
      design, the study will randomize eligible physicians from a large urban academic medical&#xD;
      center to either receive an EHR CDS tool (intervention) or not (control) when they prescribe&#xD;
      a new antipsychotic medication during a visit with a patient with ADRD. The intervention will&#xD;
      include three components: (1) alerts the prescriber that antipsychotic prescriptions increase&#xD;
      mortality; (2) offers non-pharmacological behavioral resources for caregivers; and if the&#xD;
      prescriber does not cancel the order (3) auto-defaults the prescription to contain the lowest&#xD;
      dose and number of pills (n=30) without refills. In addition, the PI will email all providers&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention arm in order to make them aware of the components of this&#xD;
      intervention and its motivation. Acknowledging the clinical complexity of this vulnerable&#xD;
      patient population, the multidisciplinary study team attempted to design the intervention to&#xD;
      maximize impact while minimizing clinician burden. Over a one-year timeframe, the study team&#xD;
      will compare the cumulative total of new antipsychotic pill-days prescribed (primary outcome)&#xD;
      by physicians in the intervention group versus in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: This pragmatic trial will advance understanding of how a multi-pronged EHR CDS&#xD;
      tool can potentially reduce harmful, low-value care among older adults with ADRD.&#xD;

    <description>When a clinician initiates a new antipsychotic prescription for a patient with dementia, a three-pronged electronic health record clinical decision support tool &quot;pops up&quot;: (1) Alerting clinicians that antipsychotic prescriptions increase patient mortality; (2) Offering non-pharmacological behavioral resources for caregivers via a link to the IDEA! strategy resources on how caregivers can best manage a patient's behavioral disturbance non-pharmacologically, which will be available in the EHR to include in the patient's after visit summary; and (3) Defaulting prescriptions to a low supply of pills in to order to minimize harm. In addition, the PI will email all providers randomized to the intervention arm in order to make them aware of the components of this intervention and its motivation.</description>
