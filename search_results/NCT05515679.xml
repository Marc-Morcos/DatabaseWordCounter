    <textblock>
      This study will involve testing of an Alpha version of an app called &quot;Building Relationships&#xD;
      using Artificial Intelligence and Nostalgia&quot; or BRAIN. The BRAIN App will be the first -ever&#xD;
      artificial intelligence infused CST app for PWD. The app has two main goals: (1) to foster&#xD;
      positive relationships between the care triad, and (2) to promote QoL while reducing&#xD;
      responsive behaviors in PWD. Testing will examine the app's impact on engagement/affect for&#xD;
      both PWD and professional Care Partners.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A quasi-experimental pretest / posttest design will be used. During a four-week baseline&#xD;
      period, researchers will collect data on engagement, quality of life, neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms, and quality of the care-patient relationship. Participants will then use the BRAIN&#xD;
      app for four weeks, during which engagement data will be collect. After the intervention&#xD;
      period, researchers will collect data again on quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms,&#xD;
      and quality of the carer-patient relationship.&#xD;
