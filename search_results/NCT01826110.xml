  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the radiotracer [11C] PIB in participants with&#xD;
      probably Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and healthy age-matched controls.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To perform PET scans with [11C]PIB to use for direct (i.e., same-subjects) comparison of&#xD;
           [11C]PIB and [18F]AV-45&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish the most effective and reliable PET imaging method to detect amyloid&#xD;
           deposition in AD, in order to understand disease progression and subsequently evaluate&#xD;
           treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To ascertain a PET imaging method that will minimize discomfort for subjects, thus&#xD;
           increasing the potential for clinical follow-up scans, by reducing the patient burden&#xD;
           and potential cost of future PET examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate protocol/study will be conducted using [18F] AV-45. Participants who enroll in&#xD;
      this protocol using [11C] PIB will be consented to participate in the [18F] AV-45 (IRB #&#xD;
      NA_00033155) protocol/study as it is a mandatory requirement that participants participate in&#xD;
      both protocols.Up to 20 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease and 10 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will participate in this study.&#xD;

             exam can tolerate the PET scan procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have clinically significant hepatic, renal, pulmonary, metabolic, or endocrine&#xD;
             disturbances&#xD;

             history of abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a clinically significant infectious disease, including Acquired Immune Deficiency&#xD;
             Syndrome (AIDS) or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection or previous positive&#xD;
             test for hepatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant (negative urine beta-hCG at the&#xD;
             time of screening and negative urine beta-hCG on the day of imaging) or lactating at&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have a history of relevant severe drug allergy or hypersensitivity (Relevant severe&#xD;
             drug allergies should be determined by the PI, and any questions about a subject's&#xD;
             eligibility can be directed to Avid. If a subject has a history of severe drug&#xD;
             allergies, it may be dangerous for them to participate in a study with a novel&#xD;
             compound&#xD;
&#xD;
