      To determine if adjunctive acupuncture acts as an AD treatment rather than a placebo, and&#xD;
      identify if benefits are linked to shifts of the gut microbiota.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture is used as an adjuvant therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but available&#xD;
      evidence for efficacy is weak. Growing studies suggest that resident gut microbiota&#xD;
      contributes to the development and progression of AD. Acupuncture is reported to treat&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and neurodegenerative disorders via the gut-brain axis. The aim is to&#xD;
      determine if adjunctive acupuncture acts as an AD treatment rather than a placebo, and&#xD;
      identify if benefits are linked to shifts of the gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, participant-masked, sham-controlled trial. One hundred and sixty&#xD;
      participants with mild AD will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either active acupuncture or&#xD;
      non-penetrating sham acupuncture (3 times weekly for 14 weeks) added to donepezil treatment&#xD;
      (5 mg per day for 28 weeks). The primary efficacy outcome is the change from baseline to week&#xD;
      28 in the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog12). Secondary efficacy outcomes&#xD;
      include other assessments of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Neuropsychiatric Inventory&#xD;
      (NPI) and gut microbiota.&#xD;

    <description>The ADAS is a rater administered instrument that was designed to assess the severity of the dysfunction in the cognitive and noncognitive behaviors characteristic of persons with AD. The cognitive subscale of the ADAS consists of 12 items (ranges from 0 to 75). Higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment.</description>

    <description>MMSE is a brief screening instrument used to assess cognitive function (orientation, memory, attention, ability to name objects, follow verbal/written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures) in elderly participants. Total score ranges from 0 to 30; lower score indicates greater disease severity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 7, Week 14, Week 21, Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item inventory developed as a rater-administered questionnaire answered by the participant's caregiver. The ADCS-ADL measures both basic and instrumental activities of daily living by participants. The total score ranges from 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating greater disease severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 7, Week 14, Week 21, Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>NPI assesses psychopathology in participants with dementia and other neurologic disorders. Information is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the participant's behavior. Total score ranges from 0 to 144, with lower scores indicating fewer behavioral disturbances</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment credibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The treatment credibility scale will be assessed by asking participants to rate their response to four questions on a 5-point scale developed by Borkovec and Nau. Total score ranges from 0 to 20; higher score indicates greater treatment credibility.</description>

    <description>Acupoints: Principal: GV20, EX-HN1, GV24 and bilateral PC6, HT7, ST36, KI3, SP6. Additional: CV6 and bilateral GB39, ST40, SP10 Sterile stainless steel disposable acupuncture needles (size 0.30 × 50 mm, Hwato brand, China) are used. After sterilization, a small plastic ring will be fixed over the acupuncture point with plaster to facilitate maintenance of blinding for the participant, and then the needle will be inserted through the plaster inside the ring. The electric stimulator (SDZ-Ⅲ electroacupuncture apparatus, Hwato brand, China) is applied to GV20, GV24, bilateral PC6 and HT7, dilatational wave, 10/50 Hz and tolerable electric current. Needles placed in other acupoints will be manually stimulated by rotation every 15 minutes. Each session lasts for 45 min.</description>

After sterilization, pragmatic placebo needles with blunt tip (size 0.30 × 50 mm, Hwato brand, China) are used. When their tips are pressed against the skin through plastic rings, participants will feel a pricking sensation. The electric stimulator is applied to bilateral SA1 and SA2 with no current output. The mental wire has been cut off with a same outlook as the electroacupuncture group. Needles placed in SA3 will be manually rotated every 15 minutes. Each session lasts for 45 min.</description>
