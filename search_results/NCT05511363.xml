    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, 38-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter,&#xD;
      outpatient study in subjects with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's Disease dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate relapse prevention in subjects with&#xD;
      psychosis associated with Alzheimer's Disease dementia treated with KarXT compared to&#xD;
      placebo. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the time from randomization to&#xD;
      discontinuation for any reason and safety and tolerability in subjects with psychosis&#xD;
      associated with Alzheimer's Disease dementia treated with KarXT compared to placebo.&#xD;

             informed consent form before any study assessments are performed. If the subject is&#xD;
             deemed not competent to provide consent, the following requirements for consent must&#xD;
             be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The subject's legally acceptable representative or caregiver/study partner, if&#xD;
                  local regulations allow, must provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;

             (completed within the past 5 years) taken during or subsequent to the onset of&#xD;
             dementia to rule out other central nervous system (CNS) disease that could account for&#xD;
             the dementia syndrome. If not available, a non-contrast brain MRI or non-contrast head&#xD;
             CT must be done during screening.&#xD;
