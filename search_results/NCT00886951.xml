    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this proposal are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the dynamic uptake and washout of 123-I MNI-388 and MNI 390, a potential&#xD;
           imaging biomarker for β-amyloid burden in brain, using single photon emission computed&#xD;
           tomography (SPECT) in similarly aged Alzheimer's (AD) subjects and healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform blood metabolite characterization of 123-I MNI-388 and MNI-390 in healthy and&#xD;
           AD subjects to determine the metabolic fate and nature of metabolites in assessment of&#xD;
           123-I MNI-388 and MNI 390 as a single photon computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging&#xD;
           agent&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The adaptation of imaging agents like 123-I MNI-388 and 123-I MNI-390 as biomarkers of&#xD;
      β-amyloid deposition in AD patients for assessing disease requires human validation studies.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to develop and characterize 123-I MNI-388 and 123-I MNI-390 as&#xD;
      objective biomarkers in AD. The significance of this work lies in applying state-of-art&#xD;
      quantitative neuroimaging tools to develop a relevant biomarker in living AD patients. In&#xD;
      this context we propose to investigate the feasibility of applying this technique as an&#xD;
      imaging biomarker of disease in AD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained for all subjects. All subjects will undergo a screening&#xD;
      evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline physical and&#xD;
      neurological evaluation and baseline cognitive evaluations. Subjects will be given a bolus&#xD;
      injection of 123-I MNI-388 and MNI 390 in an antecubital vein. Subjects will undergo serial&#xD;
      SPECT imaging scans and serial venous plasma sampling for measurement of 123-I MNI-388 and&#xD;
      MNI 390 in plasma (both protein bound and free) over a period of up to 8 hours. The&#xD;
      quantitative and visual imaging analyses will be performed by an image-processing specialist&#xD;
      who will remain blinded to any clinical information.including diagnosis. The primary imaging&#xD;
      outcome measure will be the brain regional distribution volumes expressed as a brain tissue&#xD;
      to plasma ratio of the radioligand, 123-I MNI-388 and MNI-390. Time to the peak uptake and&#xD;
      amplitude of the peak uptake will be evaluated for all brain regions and the results for the&#xD;
      AD patients and controls will be compared.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Alzheimer's Subject Selection: subjects who have a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate&#xD;
        Alzheimer's disease will be recruited for this study. The following criteria will be met&#xD;
        for inclusion of AD subjects in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is 50 years or older.&#xD;

          -  Written informed consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants have a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on National&#xD;
             Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
             and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria.&#xD;
