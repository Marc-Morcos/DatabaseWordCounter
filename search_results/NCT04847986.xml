  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot randomized controlled trial aims to assess effects of a guided online acceptance&#xD;
      and commitment therapy (ACT) intervention on distressed family caregivers of people with&#xD;
      dementia (PwD) compared to the control group. A total of 24 family caregivers of PwD who meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria will be recruited and randomized to either the intervention or control&#xD;
      group. Exploratory hypotheses are that the ACT group will show decreases in caregivers'&#xD;
      psychological distress and burden and improvements in QoL and engagement in meaningful&#xD;
      activities at posttest and 1-month follow-up, compared to the control group. Also, the&#xD;
      project will evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, adherence, and retention of caregivers&#xD;
      and explore caregivers' experiences in the ACT intervention through semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews at posttest. As part of the pretest, we will also explore caregivers' perceived&#xD;
      impacts of COVID-19 on daily lives.&#xD;

      the inclusion criteria will be recruited and randomized to either the intervention or control&#xD;
      group. Caregivers assigned to the intervention group will receive individual ACT sessions&#xD;
      guided by a trained coach for one hour per week over 8 weeks through Zoom videoconferencing&#xD;
      with supplemental psychoeducation materials provided. Caregivers assigned to the control&#xD;
      group will receive care as usual with psychoeducation materials provided. Outcomes regarding&#xD;
      caregivers' mental health will be collected at three time points (i.e., pretest, posttest,&#xD;
      and 1-month follow-up) and compared between groups over time. Exploratory hypotheses are that&#xD;
      the ACT group will show decreases in caregivers' psychological distress and burden and&#xD;
      improvements in QoL and engagement in meaningful activities at posttest and 1-month&#xD;
      follow-up, compared to the control group. Also, the project will evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
