  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that activation of the sympathetic nervous system for extended periods or&#xD;
      during certain times in life can increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease. Some research in&#xD;
      animal models show that acute activation of the sympathetic nervous system through stress&#xD;
      exposure can increase certain Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers, such as amyloid-beta,&#xD;
      within hours of exposure. However, how acute sympathetic nervous system activation via stress&#xD;
      exposure affects amyloid-beta levels in humans has yet to be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, recent research suggests that daily activation of the parasympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system, via 5-weeks of heart rate variability biofeedback training can decrease amyloid-beta&#xD;
      levels in blood. However, like acute sympathetic nervous system activation, it is unknown&#xD;
      whether a single episode of parasympathetic nervous system activation can reduce amyloid-beta&#xD;
      levels in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will examine whether brief increases in sympathetic and&#xD;
      parasympathetic activation result in immediate changes in plasma amyloid-beta levels in the&#xD;
      five hours after exposure.&#xD;

      Aim 1: determine whether acute exposure to stress (increasing sympathetic nervous system&#xD;
      activation) increases plasma amyloid-beta-40 and amyloid-beta-42 in the five hours following&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: determine whether acute exposure to heart rate variability biofeedback training&#xD;
      (increasing parasympathetic nervous system activation) decreases plasma amyloid-beta-40 and&#xD;
      amyloid-beta-42 in the five hours following exposure.&#xD;

    <description>Stress will be induced using the socially evaluated cold pressor test and a guided thought exercise about individuals' to-do lists.&#xD;
Participants will complete three rounds of the social evaluated cold pressor test followed by a guided thought exercise about their to-do list for the coming day, week, month, and year.&#xD;
The socially evaluated cold pressor test involves submerging one hand in ice-cold water for 3 minutes while participants' reactions are filmed on camera.</description>

    <description>Biofeedback about heart rate will be provided to participants during a slow-paced breathing exercise.&#xD;
Participants will complete three rounds of heart rate variability biofeedback training, with a short break between rounds.&#xD;
Heart rate variability biofeedback training consists of breathing at a slow pace to maximize heart rate oscillations (the increases and decreases in heart rate that accompany inhalation and exhalation). Participants will wear a heart rate monitoring device on their ear, which will connect by USB to a computer. The computer will provide feedback on their heart rate oscillations during the slow-paced breathing exercise.</description>
