  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photobiomodulation (PBM) describes the use of near-infrared light (which is not visible to&#xD;
      the eye) to heal and protect tissue that has either been injured, is degenerating, or else is&#xD;
      at risk of dying. Research suggests that the light delivered during PBM enhances the body's&#xD;
      biochemical ability to store and use energy and increase blood flow, which triggers the&#xD;
      body's natural healing processes. The primary goal of this study is to determine if PBM&#xD;
      administered transcranially (through the scalp and skull) and intranasally (inside the nose)&#xD;
      with a commercially available device is safe and tolerable for patients with mild-to-moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Secondary goals are to examine whether tPBM has an effect on&#xD;
      cognitive function and behavioral symptoms in patients with AD and whether tPBM has an effect&#xD;
      on fluid biomarkers of AD. A biomarker is a specific physical trait used to measure the&#xD;
      progress of a disease or condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by the loss of&#xD;
      higher brain function such as memory, problem-solving abilities, and language.&#xD;
      Photobiomodulation (PBM) describes a kind of light therapy that uses red or near-infrared&#xD;
      light to stimulate, heal, regenerate, and protect tissue that has either been injured, is&#xD;
      degenerating, or else is at risk of dying. The pathological hallmarks of AD include senile&#xD;
      plaques rich in β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles composed of&#xD;
      hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau). In animal models of AD, PBM reduces the size and number of&#xD;
      brain Aβ plaques, p-tau, and neurofibrillary tangles. PBM also mitigates behavioral deficits&#xD;
      in transgenic AD mouse models and humans with dementia. The goal of this sham-controlled&#xD;
      pilot trial is to investigate the effects of PBM on the cognitive function, behavioral&#xD;
      symptoms, and fluid (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood) biomarkers of AD pathology&#xD;
      including amyloid burden, tangle pathology, axonal injury, microglia activation/inflammation,&#xD;
      and neurotrophic factors in 16 patients with biomarkers-supported probable Alzheimer's&#xD;
      dementia, according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and&#xD;
      Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the study is to examine the safety and tolerability of home administered&#xD;
      transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) with a commercially available device in patients with&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate AD. Another goal of the study is to examine the effect PMB on cognitive&#xD;
      function and behavioral symptoms in patients with probable AD. The study's final goal is to&#xD;
      examine the effects of 16 weeks of PBM on fluid biomarkers of inflammation (i.e., monocyte&#xD;
      chemoattractant protein 1 and 3 [MCP-1 and MCP-3] and macrophage inflammatory protein 1β&#xD;
      [MIP-1β]), neurodegeneration (i.e., ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 [UCH-L1]&#xD;
      and neurofilament light chain [NfL]) and neurotrophic factors (i.e., vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor [VEGF] and brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF]). We will also explore the&#xD;
      relationship between cognitive and behavioral changes after 16 weeks of PBM with changes in&#xD;
      biomarkers of inflammation, neurotrophic factors, and neurodegeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixteen patients with biomarkers-supported probable Alzheimer's dementia will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to an active or sham PBM group. All patients will be asked to use the&#xD;
      Vielight Neuro Gamma (real or sham) device for 20 minutes/day, every other day, for 16 weeks.&#xD;
      Randomization with blind assignment will be determined by a computer-generated random&#xD;
      allocation. We will assess safety and tolerability by comparing adverse events (AD) in each&#xD;
      group. Cognition, behavioral symptoms, and biomarker measures will be assessed in all study&#xD;
      participants at baseline and after 16 weeks of PBM. Biomarkers will be obtained through a&#xD;
      blood draw and lumbar puncture. A lumbar puncture (also called a spinal tap) is a procedure&#xD;
      to collect cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF), which surrounds the brain and spinal cord. During a&#xD;
      lumbar puncture, a needle is carefully inserted into the spinal canal low in the back (lumbar&#xD;
      area).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study partners (e.g., caregivers) will be asked to answer questions about the study&#xD;
      participant's memory and daily functioning at baseline and after 16 weeks of PBM. Study&#xD;
      partners will also be trained and ask to help the study partners administer PBM treatments&#xD;
      with the Vielight Neuro Gamma device at home for 16 weeks.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAS-cog is the most popular cognitive testing instrument used in clinical trials of nootropics. It consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis, attention and other cognitive abilities which are often referred to as the core symptoms of AD. Higher ADAS-cog scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.&#xD;
The changes score was determined by calculating the ratio of the ADAS-cog score at week 16 over the ADAS-cog score at baseline. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores &lt; 1 or &gt; 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in ADAS-cog score compared to baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Performance on Color Trails Test (CTT2/CTT1 Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CTT is a non-verbal test of visual attention, graphomotor sequencing, and effortful executive processing abilities (i.e., sustained attention and set shifting). A higher index score indicates less cognitive flexibility, a lower ability to shift attention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on the Neuropsychiatriac Inventory (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>NPI is a well-validated, reliable, multi-item instrument to assess psychopathology (e.g., behavioral symptoms) in AD based on a questionnaire completed by the participants' study partners. Higher scores indicate more symptoms and/or more severe symptoms.&#xD;
The changes score was determined by calculating the ratio of the week 16 NPI score over the baseline NPI score. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores &lt; 1 or &gt; 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in NPI compared to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ADCS-ADL assesses the competence of patients with AD in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs). It can be completed by a caregiver in questionnaire format, or administered by a clinician/researcher as a structured interview with a caregiver. ADCS-ADL scores range from 0-53, with higher scores indicating greater independence. The changes score was determined by calculating the ratio of the week 16 ADCS-ADL score over the baseline ADCS-ADL score. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores &lt; 1 or &gt; 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in ADCS-ADL compared to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Plasma Levels of Aβ42</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Although Aβ42 is present in plasma, it is unclear whether it originates from peripheral sources or from the brain. Because Aβ can be transported bidirectionally across the blood-brain barrier, it has been hypothesized that there may be an equilibrium between CSF and plasma pools of Aβ. Decreased levels of Aβ42 in CSF occurs in conjunction with cognitive decline. However, patients with mutations in chromosome 21 that cause early-onset familial AD and patients with trisomy 21 have increased levels of plasma Aβ42 before the onset of the symptoms of dementia. Therefore, it is possible that plasma Aβ42 levels increase with cognitive decline. The change score was determined by calculating the ratio of plasma Aβ42 at week 16 over the ADAS-cog score at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CSF Levels of Aβ42.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Aβ42 is a biomarker of AD pathology. CSF levels of Aβ42 decrease in conjunction with the cognitive decline. The change score was determined by calculating the ratio of CSF Aβ42 at week 16 over the ADAS-cog score at baseline. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores &lt; 1 or &gt; 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in CSF levels of Aβ42 compared to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Plasma Levels of Tau.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tau, the microtubule-associated protein, forms insoluble filaments that accumulate as neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research suggests that plasma tau levels increased with AD severity. The change score was determined by calculating the ratio of the week 16 plasma tau over the baseline plasma tau levels. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores &lt; 1 or &gt; 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in plasma tau compared to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CSF Levels of Tau</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tau forms insoluble filaments that accumulate as neurofibrillary tangles in AD. Increased levels of tau in CSF is a key characteristic of AD and is considered to result from neurodegeneration. The change score was determined by calculating the ratio of week 16 CSF tau over baseline CSF tau. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores &lt; 1 or &gt; 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in CSF tau compared to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Plasma Levels of Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a marker of axonal degeneration and is robustly elevated in the blood of many neurological and neurodegenerative conditions, including AD. The change score was determined by calculating the ratio of week 16 plasma levels of NfL over the baseline levels of plasma NfL. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores &lt; 1 or &gt; 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in plasma levels of NfL compared to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CSF Levels of NfL</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a marker of axonal degeneration and is robustly elevated in the blood of many neurological and neurodegenerative conditions, including AD. There is a strong relationship with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NfL, suggesting that these biomarker modalities reflect the same pathological process. The change score was determined by calculating the ratio of week CSF NfL over baseline CSF NfL. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores &lt; 1 or &gt; 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in CSF NfL compared to baseline.</description>

          <description>This arm will receive active photobiomodulation (PBM), delivered with the Vielight Neuro Gamma device, once every other day (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri) for 20 minutes for 16 weeks.&#xD;
Vielight Neuro Gamma: The Vielight Neuro Gamma is headset that delivers transcranial (through the scalp and skull) and intranasal (through the nose) near infrared (NIR) light. The device is engineered for increased efficacy and easy domestic use for comprehensive brain photobiomodulation (PBM). The NIR lights are pulsed at a 40 Hz rate, which correlates with electroencephalogram (EEG) gamma brain wave entrainment.</description>

          <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) is a brief neuropsychological assessment used to assess the severity of cognitive symptoms of dementia. It is one of the most widely used cognitive scales in clinical trials and is considered to be the &quot;gold standard&quot; for assessing antidementia treatments. Scores (errors) on single scale range from 0 to 70. Higher scores are indicative of greater cognitive impairment.</description>

          <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) measures the presence and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms. Symptoms are rated in terms of frequency (1=rarely, &lt;1x/week; 2=sometimes, ~1x/week; 3=often, several times/week; and 4=very often, &gt;1x/day) and severity (1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe). The composite symptom domain score (frequencyXseverity) ranges from 0 (no behavioral symptoms) to 144 points. Caregiver distress is rated for each positive neuropsychiatric symptom domain (0=no distress; 1=minimal distress; 2=mild distress; 3=moderate distress; 4=severe distress; and 5=very severe distress).</description>

          <description>The ADCS-ADL assesses the competence of patients with dementia in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs). It can be completed by a caregiver in questionnaire format, or administered by a clinician/researcher as a structured interview. The ADCS-ADL is a 23 item scale that includes 6 basic activities of daily living items (e.g., grooming/dressing) and 17 instrumental activities of daily living items (e.g., cooking/managing finance) that provide a total score from 0-78, with a lower score indicating greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog)</title>
        <description>The ADAS-cog is the most popular cognitive testing instrument used in clinical trials of nootropics. It consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis, attention and other cognitive abilities which are often referred to as the core symptoms of AD. Higher ADAS-cog scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.&#xD;
The changes score was determined by calculating the ratio of the ADAS-cog score at week 16 over the ADAS-cog score at baseline. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores &lt; 1 or &gt; 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in ADAS-cog score compared to baseline.</description>

        <title>Change in Plasma Levels of Aβ42</title>
        <description>Although Aβ42 is present in plasma, it is unclear whether it originates from peripheral sources or from the brain. Because Aβ can be transported bidirectionally across the blood-brain barrier, it has been hypothesized that there may be an equilibrium between CSF and plasma pools of Aβ. Decreased levels of Aβ42 in CSF occurs in conjunction with cognitive decline. However, patients with mutations in chromosome 21 that cause early-onset familial AD and patients with trisomy 21 have increased levels of plasma Aβ42 before the onset of the symptoms of dementia. Therefore, it is possible that plasma Aβ42 levels increase with cognitive decline. The change score was determined by calculating the ratio of plasma Aβ42 at week 16 over the ADAS-cog score at baseline.</description>

Because Aβ can be transported bidirectionally across the blood-brain barrier, it has been hypothesized that there may be an equilibrium between CSF and plasma pools of Aβ. Decreased levels of Aβ42 in CSF occurs in conjunction with cognitive decline. However, patients with mutations in chromosome 21 that cause early-onset familial AD and patients with trisomy 21 have increased levels of plasma Aβ42 before the onset of the symptoms of dementia. Therefore, it is possible that plasma Aβ42 levels increase with cognitive decline. The change score was determined by calculating the ratio of plasma Aβ42 at week 16 over the ADAS-cog score at baseline.</description>

        <description>Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a marker of axonal degeneration and is robustly elevated in the blood of many neurological and neurodegenerative conditions, including AD. There is a strong relationship with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NfL, suggesting that these biomarker modalities reflect the same pathological process. The change score was determined by calculating the ratio of week CSF NfL over baseline CSF NfL. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores &lt; 1 or &gt; 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in CSF NfL compared to baseline.</description>

        <population>One Active REAL PBM patient did not return for post-treatment assessment due to pandemic-related lock-down; two REAL PBM patient's post-treatment samples were contaminated. One SHAM patient was excluded for unblinding, two SHAM patients were institutionalized during the study; two other SHAM patients had failed lumbar punctures.</population>

Vielight Neuro Gamma: The Vielight Neuro Gamma is headset that delivers transcranial (through the scalp and skull) and intranasal (through the nose) near infrared (NIR) light. The device is engineered for increased efficacy and easy domestic use for comprehensive brain photobiomodulation (PBM). The NIR lights are pulsed at a 40 Hz rate, which correlates with electroencephalogram (EEG) gamma brain wave entrainment.</description>
