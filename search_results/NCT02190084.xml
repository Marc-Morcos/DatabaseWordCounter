    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) is a major public health problem. Apathy, a profound loss of&#xD;
      motivation, is seen in majority of patients with AD. Dysfunction of the front of the brain&#xD;
      and loss of dopamine, a type of neurochemical, in this part of brain results in apathy.&#xD;
      Presence of apathy is linked to deficits in planning sequential tasks such as keeping a&#xD;
      routine. Patients with apathy have poor physical function and their caregivers experience&#xD;
      extra burden. Unfortunately there are no good medications to treat apathy. FDA has approved&#xD;
      the use of brain stimulation by a magnet known as repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS), for treatment of depression. rTMS increases dopamine when applied to&#xD;
      frontal lobe of brain so we propose that rTMS would be a good treatment option for apathy in&#xD;
      AD. Study hypotheses include that rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) will&#xD;
      improve apathy and executive function better than sham treatment in those with AD.&#xD;

      Objective: Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) is a major public health problem. Apathy, a profound&#xD;
      loss of motivation, is seen in majority of patients with AD. Dysfunction of the front of the&#xD;
      brain and loss of dopamine, a type of neurochemical, in this part of brain results in apathy.&#xD;
      Presence of apathy is linked to deficits in planning sequential tasks such as keeping a&#xD;
      routine. Patients with apathy have poor physical function and their caregivers experience&#xD;
      extra burden. Unfortunately there are no good medications to treat apathy. FDA has approved&#xD;
      the use of brain stimulation by a magnet known as repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS), for treatment of depression. rTMS increases dopamine when applied to&#xD;
      frontal lobe of brain so we propose that rTMS would be a good treatment option for apathy in&#xD;
      AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: To determine the efficacy of rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (DLPFC) in treating apathy in mild AD in comparison to sham treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare the efficacy of rTMS to the DLPFC on executive function in mild AD in comparison&#xD;
      to sham treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: Current study is a prospective randomized sham controlled study of daily rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Up to 500 subjects will be pre-screened to enroll 100 subjects for screening and&#xD;
      randomizing up to 50 subjects to analyze 20 completers. Subjects with mild AD and apathy will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to rTMS or sham treatment after consent. All subjects will be tested for&#xD;
      memory, behavioral problems, functioning and caregiver burden. Apathy will be assessed using&#xD;
      the Apathy Evaluation Scale. Memory, executive function, functional status and caregiver&#xD;
      burden will be assessed. Subjects will receive daily treatments for 4 weeks with either rTMS&#xD;
      or sham coil for a total of 20 treatments. Neither the subject nor the investigators will&#xD;
      know which treatment the subject is receiving. Testing will be repeated at the end of 4 weeks&#xD;
      and at 8 and 12 weeks after treatment.&#xD;
