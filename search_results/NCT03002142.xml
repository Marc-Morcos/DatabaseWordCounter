  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that subjects with&#xD;
      hearing loss are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. Hearing loss can be consecutive&#xD;
      to presbycusis and/or to central auditory dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard audiometric measures with pure tone and speech intelligibility allow the diagnosis&#xD;
      of presbycusis. However, to demonstrate central auditory dysfunction, specific audiometric&#xD;
      tests as noisy and/or dichotic tests, are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually, no consensus exists to investigate hearing loss in people with Alzheimer's disease;&#xD;
      therefore hearing loss may be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Until now,&#xD;
      investigations and clinical procedure related to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease ignored&#xD;
      the hearing ability of the patient. However, the major part of care management and&#xD;
      investigations implies the patient's communication ability with caregivers. Hearing loss may&#xD;
      be one of the most unrecognized deficit in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Auditory&#xD;
      rehabilitation with hearing aids could benefit to the patient to decrease cognitive decline&#xD;
      but this management must be investigate during longitudinal studies in order to demonstrate&#xD;
      their efficiency and need to be compared with a placebo.&#xD;
