  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project's main goal is to use state-of-the-art passive sensing techniques to identify&#xD;
      digital biomarkers that relate to bioenergetic changes in the brain due to nicotinamide&#xD;
      riboside supplementation in those with mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;

      The investigators will conduct a prospective, single-arm, non-interventional study using the&#xD;
      Emerald device to monitor the behavior of individuals enrolled in the parent study&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04430517). Investigators aim to enroll approximately 40&#xD;
      individuals aged 18 -89 (inclusive) with either MCI or mild AD who will have Emerald deployed&#xD;
      in their home for up to 12 weeks, spanning the time of approval of parent study screening and&#xD;
      formal study enrollment. The Emerald device is a radio-wave sensor that uses signal&#xD;
      processing and machine learning algorithms to track the gait, movement, respiration, and&#xD;
      sleep of subjects without physical contact or effort by the user, i.e. it neither requires&#xD;
      the subject to wear a sensor nor record any data. Emerald works by transmitting low-powered&#xD;
      radio signals, 1000x less than Wi-Fi, that reflect off of the subject and return back to the&#xD;
      device. If the user moves their arm or leg, or their chest expands and contracts from&#xD;
      breathing, that movement changes how the signal reflects off of their body. Emerald records&#xD;
      these reflections and processes them using algorithms that convert the radio signals into&#xD;
      movement data, breathing rate, sleep stages (Awake, Light, Deep and REM), and key sleep&#xD;
      parameters. The device will be deployed in the bedroom of each subject to capture behavior&#xD;
      continuously.&#xD;

        Subjects will be recruited from the existing pool of study subjects for the parent study&#xD;
        (MGB IRB protocol #2020P001652, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04430517). Participation&#xD;
        in this supplemental portion of the parent study will be elective for study subjects.&#xD;
        Separate informed consent for the installation of the Emerald device will be used, and&#xD;
        recruitment for this study will run concurrently with the parent project (IRB protocol&#xD;
        #2020P001652, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04430517). All consented individuals will be&#xD;
