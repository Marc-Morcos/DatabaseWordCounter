      The three primary goals of this pilot will be followed by a secondary goal to test if dental&#xD;
      intervention improves brain health in terms of sleep and cognition. The primary and secondary&#xD;
      goals are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore the ratios of brain energy (ATP/PCr, Pi/PCr) and phospholipids (PME/PDE)&#xD;
           metabolites as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 7 Tesla, and compare the&#xD;
           differences in them with the performance of episodic memory, attention, language, and&#xD;
           executive functions (abstraction, reasoning, verbal fluency, working memory) in three&#xD;
           groups: cognitively normal adults, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's&#xD;
           disease (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the differences in sleep patterns measured by the ratio sleep quality index&#xD;
           (Stable/ Unstable sleep) in cognitively normal adults, MCI and AD and its relation to&#xD;
           the performance of episodic memory, attention, language, and executive functions&#xD;
           (abstraction, reasoning, verbal fluency, working memory) in three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate the differences in the variations of two genes, APOE-E4 and ABCA7, in&#xD;
           relationship to the changes in the brain energy metabolites and its relation to the&#xD;
           performance of episodic memory, attention, language, and executive functions&#xD;
           (abstraction, reasoning, verbal fluency, working memory) in those with cognitively&#xD;
           normal adults, MCI and AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigate if dental intervention improves sleep patterns and overall cognitive&#xD;
           behavior in the three cohorts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly progressing in the elder population and the&#xD;
      pathophysiological changes in the brain start at least 1-2 decades before the disease onset.&#xD;
      During this period of slow progression, individuals may notice subtle changes in the memory&#xD;
      and this subset of the population is termed as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). MCI is a&#xD;
      pre-clinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in which individuals have memory complaints&#xD;
      but are functionally independent and not yet clinically diagnosed with dementia. New&#xD;
      modalities for potential identification of the progression of the disease, include different&#xD;
      biomarkers, state-of-the-art technologies like sleep tracking and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy (MRS) may provide additional, essential tools to facilitate early detection of&#xD;
      disease, which may allow for earlier intervention and provide a potential gauge for a&#xD;
      response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first goal of this research project aims to understand the variations in the brain energy&#xD;
      and phospholipid metabolites as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 7 Tesla across&#xD;
      three groups: cognitively healthy adults, MCI, and AD. The brain requires a lot of energy in&#xD;
      the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to support the neuronal activity, and it has a rich&#xD;
      source of phospholipids to maintain biological functions. Therefore, abnormalities in the&#xD;
      mechanism of energy supply and phospholipids can affect a wide range of function in the&#xD;
      neuronal cells. Previous literature using 18FDG PET scan has shown impairments in brain&#xD;
      glucose metabolism associated with cognitive decline in MCI even before the individual&#xD;
      presents with clinically apparent cognitive dysfunction. Thus, measuring the ratio of energy&#xD;
      metabolites ATP-to-PCr (ATP/PCr) and Pi-to-PCr (Pi/PCr) offers a promising way to predict the&#xD;
      active status of the resting brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the levels of phospholipids start to decrease by the age of twenty (20), and&#xD;
      more pronounced decline is noticed after the age of 80 years. Thus, aging and diseased brains&#xD;
      are more susceptible to the changes in the levels of phospholipids metabolites which can lead&#xD;
      to neurodegenerative disorders. Two classes of phospholipid metabolites that can be studied&#xD;
      using 31P MRS are phosphomonoesters (PMEs) and phosphodiesterase (PDEs). PMEs are the&#xD;
      essential building blocks for cell/neuronal membrane synthesis whereas PDEs are the&#xD;
      metabolites from the breakdown of the cell/neuronal phospholipids membrane. A higher ratio of&#xD;
      PMEs-to-PDEs can, therefore, reflect as an improvement in brain health leading to&#xD;
      neurogenesis, with the opposite suggesting neurodegeneration. Thus, 31P MRS has opened a&#xD;
      window to measure various neurochemical metabolites non-invasively, which could provide&#xD;
      detailed information about important high-energy phosphate metabolites, as well as&#xD;
      phospholipid metabolites in real time. 7T Ultra-high magnetic field MRI scanner, which is now&#xD;
      increasingly accessible worldwide and enables fast and accurate BEM measurement, may provide&#xD;
      a comprehensive approach for aiding in the diagnosis of the neurodegenerative process from&#xD;
      cognitively normal adults to MCI and AD and also monitoring the treatment responses to newer&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, disturbance in sleep patterns can impact the brain's energy metabolism by altering&#xD;
      the ratio of brain energy and phospholipid metabolites, thereby causing impaired brain&#xD;
      cognitive functions. Aging is a significant moderator of sleep quality and may affect non-REM&#xD;
      slow wave sleep (SWS), which facilitates the clearance of toxic material like amyloid&#xD;
      protein. Stable sleep helps restore the neurobiological and neurophysiological responses&#xD;
      about energy requirements impacting the changes in the concentration of brain energy and&#xD;
      phospholipid metabolism. Currently, data are lacking regarding the relationship between&#xD;
      sleep, brain energy requirement and its effect on the performance of cognitive domains to&#xD;
      healthy aging, MCI, and AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, BEM is regulated by specific genes that support the continuous energy requirements&#xD;
      for the electrical activity of the brain. Hence in this research, we are interested in&#xD;
      investigating the effect of two genes APOE ε4 and ABCA7 on brain energy and phospholipids&#xD;
      metabolites in the three groups. It is essential to understand this connection as genes&#xD;
      regulate the synthesis of appropriate protein/enzymes like ABCA7 transporter protein for&#xD;
      glucose metabolism leading to energy production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, based on an &quot;improving sleep first hypothesis,&quot; a dental intervention (MyTAP;&#xD;
      midline traction oral appliance (OA) therapy will be offered to participants presenting with&#xD;
      abnormal sleep and upper airway obstruction parameters. Therapeutic response to attenuate&#xD;
      upper airway obstruction in sleep by using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was&#xD;
      shown also to improve cognitive functioning in AD patients with OSA. In most cases, upper&#xD;
      airway obstruction can also be acutely corrected using a simple fitted, clinically proven,&#xD;
      FDA-cleared midline traction design oral appliance to restore sleep quality and possibly&#xD;
      improve cognition and 'normalize' BEM. There are currently no reports on the efficacy of oral&#xD;
      appliance therapy to improve daytime sleepiness, objective sleep measures and cognitive&#xD;
      function in patients with MCI or AD. The MyTAP is similar to other midline traction design&#xD;
      oral appliances which have been in clinical use for over 20 years without any serious adverse&#xD;
      effects in treating patients with primary snoring to severe sleep apnea The MyTAP oral&#xD;
      appliance will be used in accordance with its indications for use and FDA-approved labeling.&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of the midline traction oral appliance have already been published.&#xD;
      As per FDA cleared label MyTAP® OA family of intra-oral devices are intended for the&#xD;
      treatment of night-time snoring and mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea in patients 18&#xD;
      years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be concluded in two phases. In Phase-1, the eligible participant will complete&#xD;
      a set of neurocognitive testing, genetic sample collection, sleep assessment, and MRS scan.&#xD;
      If the participant is interested in dental intervention, they will progress to Phase-2. In&#xD;
      Phase-2 of the study, subjects will complete the dental intervention for three months&#xD;
      followed by neurocognitive testing and sleep assessment.&#xD;
