  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether a set of algorithms analysing&#xD;
      acoustic and linguistic patterns of speech, can predict change in PACC5 between baseline and&#xD;
      +12 month follow up across all four Arms, as measured by the coefficient of individual&#xD;
      agreement (CIA) between the change in PACC5 and the corresponding regression model, trained&#xD;
      on baseline speech data to predict it. Secondary objectives include (1) evaluating whether&#xD;
      similar algorithms can predict change in PACC5 between baseline and +12 month follow up in&#xD;
      the cognitively normal (CN) and MCI populations separately; (2) evaluating whether similar&#xD;
      algorithms trained to regress against PACC5 scores at baseline, still regress significantly&#xD;
      against PACC5 scores at +12 month follow-up, as measured by the coefficient of individual&#xD;
      agreement (CIA) between the PACC5 composite at +12 months and the regression model, trained&#xD;
      on baseline speech data to predict PACC5 scores at baseline; (3) evaluating whether similar&#xD;
      algorithms can classify converters vs non-converters in the cognitively normal Arms (Arm 3 +&#xD;
      4), and fast vs slow decliners in the MCI Arms (Arm 1 + 2), as measured by the AUC,&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity and Cohen's kappa of the corresponding binary classifiers. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives include the objectives above, but using time points of +24 months and +36 months;&#xD;
      and finally to evaluate whether the model performance for the objectives and outcomes above&#xD;
      improved if the model has access to speech data at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 month timepoints.&#xD;
