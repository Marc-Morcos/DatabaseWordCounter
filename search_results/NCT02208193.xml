  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gardens and art represent public spaces and support venues of interactions and emotions,&#xD;
      seeking not only a variety of conversational themes but also various cognitive skills such as&#xD;
      mnemonic skills. The cognitive and psycho-behavioral effects of art and the garden, jointly&#xD;
      associated and made available to patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, need to be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN OBJECTIVE Delineate the psychological scaffolding virtues of art and garden on cognitive&#xD;
      and emotional processes by means of interview analyses in Alzheimer patients and control&#xD;
      subjects based on the &quot; art, memory and life &quot; garden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Adapt eco-psychosocial approaches of care management to Alzheimer&#xD;
      patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  create assessment methods of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the therapeutic efficacy of the design of the &quot; art, memory and life &quot; garden,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the perception of an artistic dimension in the living environment of those with&#xD;
           Alzheimer's disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  establish:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  workshop applications using art and the garden for therapeutic purposes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  general recommendations for the layout of the garden. PRIMARY ENDPOINT Quantitative data&#xD;
           of discursive productions stemming from Interlocutory Logic (Trognon and Batt, 2007,&#xD;
           2010, 2011) for the analysis of interactive behaviors and the assessment of parameters&#xD;
           including esthetic appraisals, well-being, mnemonic and emotional processes (frequency&#xD;
           and nature of these processes) as well as spatio-temporal orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scores obtained in standard neuropsychological tests, in particular to assess&#xD;
           spatio-temporal orientation (Folstein MMSE),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scores obtained with the &quot; MemoArtZ &quot; tool (MAZ) to evaluate the memorization of&#xD;
           artistic elements of the garden,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scores from the &quot; General Esthetic Preference &quot; (GEP) tool to evaluate the consistency&#xD;
           of general esthetic appreciations,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Score obtained with the specific mood assessment scale (CSDD) for subjects in group A,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Score obtained with the specific assessment of emotional events scale (AES) for all&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open, monocentric, controlled (group of healthy control subjects) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A &quot;Alzheimer group&quot;: patients with mild to severe stages of Alzheimer's disease:&#xD;
      subgroup A1 &quot;Alzheimer group hospitalized at the Paul Spillmann Centre (Centre Paul&#xD;
      Spillmann, CPS)&quot; (CHU de Nancy, France); subgroup A2 &quot;Alzheimer group monitored at the&#xD;
      Resource and Research Memory Centre (Centre Mémoire de Ressources et de Recherche, CMRR)&quot;&#xD;
      (CHU de Nancy, France) Group B &quot;healthy control group&quot;: healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic fallouts of this study will benefit Alzheimer patients in terms of better care&#xD;
      management, notably: i) by determining the design, conception and layout of the gardens&#xD;
      destined to these patients, ii) by developing the introduction of an artistic dimension to&#xD;
      the design of such healing gardens and in their living environment, iii) by establishing&#xD;
      workshop application perspectives using the contemplation of works of art and the garden for&#xD;
      therapeutic purposes.&#xD;

      RESEARCH METHODOLOGY / EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open, monocentric, controlled (group of healthy control subjects) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A &quot;Alzheimer group&quot;: patients with mild to severe stages of Alzheimer's disease:&#xD;
      subgroup A1 &quot;Alzheimer group hospitalized at the Paul Spillmann Centre (Centre Paul&#xD;
      Spillmann, CPS)&quot; (CHU de Nancy, France); subgroup A2 &quot;Alzheimer group monitored at the&#xD;
      Resource and Research Memory Centre (Centre Mémoire de Ressources et de Recherche, CMRR)&quot;&#xD;
      (CHU de Nancy, France) Group B &quot;healthy control group&quot;: healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      TASKS SPECIFIC TO THE STUDY: MATERIALS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview methodology: The interrelationships between garden, art, cognition and behavior&#xD;
      will be assessed. The endpoints of these dimensions will be achieved by an analysis of&#xD;
      subject-psychologist interactions via interviews in the garden (in-context) and in&#xD;
      out-of-context mnemonic interviews. These interviews will be recorded and transcribed&#xD;
      verbatim. The interest of juxtaposing these two interview situations, in a comparative&#xD;
      analysis of interactional production, is to be able to access different cognitive skills in&#xD;
      order to analyze these skills. All of the data will be extracted through the quantitative&#xD;
      analysis of discursive productions stemming from Interlocutory Logic (Trognon and Batt, 2007,&#xD;
      2010, 2011). The investigators analyses will consist, on the one hand, of exploring the&#xD;
      public production of private thoughts of the subject (cognition and emotions) and secondly,&#xD;
      to modelize interactive behaviors. The interlocutory space will be both referential and&#xD;
      modal. All in all, the investigators will observe and analyze the eventual discursive&#xD;
      productions of the subject in reference to the &quot;art, memory and life&quot; garden, whether they&#xD;
      are related to the subject's experiences in the garden (in-context), to the narrative&#xD;
      situation in recounting his or her experience in the garden (out-of-context) or to the&#xD;
      spontaneous use of the garden for subjects in group A1. The implemented approach will have a&#xD;
      strong ecological perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interlocutory logic is an analysis method developed in the INTERPSY laboratory . This&#xD;
      pragmatic-dialogic method analyzes discourse in situations of interaction. This analytical&#xD;
      process is aimed at expliciting the basic components of communication, interlocutory&#xD;
      management and socio-cognitive-discursive events occurring in conversations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects in Group A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mood assessment: Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD, Cornell, 1988), translated&#xD;
      into French.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects in Group A and in Group B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of emotional events: Apathy Scale: Marin's Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire on artistic and cultural activities (ACA) pertaining to all artistic and&#xD;
           cultural activities that the subject appreciates and/or is engaged in or has engaged in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of general esthetic preferences: &quot;General Esthetic Preference&quot; (GEP) tool&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Designed along the lines of those used by Kawabata and Zeki and by Halpern et al. for&#xD;
           their respective studies (Kawabata and Zeki, 2010; Halpern et al., 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Materials: photographs representing works of art - paintings and sculptures - belonging&#xD;
           to three styles: figurative, stylized or abstract, each representing categories - living&#xD;
           or non-living.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Task to be performed by the subject: for each photograph presented, the subject's task&#xD;
           is to express an esthetic judgment using a visual analogue scale. After collecting the&#xD;
           subject's esthetic judgment, his or her esthetic emotions will be assessed through two&#xD;
           propositional questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: Document the feelings relative to the person's preference for a certain&#xD;
           artistic style.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview-discovery and interview-knowledge of the garden (in-context) (30 min per&#xD;
      interview): During the walk-through, the subject, accompanied by the psychologist, will&#xD;
      observe the entire garden and its artistic elements. The subject will be queried through a&#xD;
      discussion aimed at promoting the expressing of immediate reactions on the artistic&#xD;
      dimensions. The analytical approach will enable to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the esthetic preferences of the artistic elements integrated in the garden&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the mnemonic and emotional processes (nature and frequency) that are mobilized during&#xD;
           the contemplation of the elements of the garden, whether vegetation or artistic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the expressions of well-being and curiosity prompted by the works of art&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the mnemonic processes referring to temporality and space&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out-of-context assessments (90 min per assessment):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mnemonic interview (about 30 min): in a closed office blinded to the outside, the&#xD;
           psychologist invites the subject to recall what he or she has experienced in the garden.&#xD;
           In other words, the subject is asked to narrate an experience outside of its context. In&#xD;
           this situation, the context must be formalized verbally which leads to the mobilization&#xD;
           of cognitive skills other than those mobilized in the first in-context situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General esthetic preferences (GEP tool): This assessment will reveal the perseverance&#xD;
           for certain esthetic preferences or, conversely, the detachment relative to certain&#xD;
           styles or categories addressed prior to the first walk in the garden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mnemonic aspects of artistic elements &quot; MémoArtZ &quot; (MAZ) tool:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Task to be performed by the subject: view photographs representing the various works of&#xD;
           art discovered in the garden, inserted amidst distractive elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instructions: &quot;Show me the photograph that represents an item you saw in the garden&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim: the analysis will enable to objectify potential encoded memory recalls referring to&#xD;
           the artistic elements of the garden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mnemonic processes regarding temporality and space will also be brought to light&#xD;
           through exchanges initiated by open questions, particularly around the theme of the&#xD;
           current season of the year. The investigators will observe whether the fact of having&#xD;
           been in the garden allows the subject to change and readjust his or her eventually&#xD;
           inadequate response given at the MMSE (context aid).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mood assessment (CSDD) for subjects in group A only&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of emotional events (AES) for subjects in groups A and B.&#xD;

    <description>Each interaction between a subject and the psychologist is distributed into a interlocutory analysis table (Trognon and Batt, 2010 ; Batt, Trognon, Rivasseau-Jonveaux, Vernant and Jonveaux, 2014) where each utterance is noticed by its speech turn and its speech act. The second consists of a force (for example, an assertive force, as when I was eight, I loved the garden my parents owned) and a propositional content (for example, a feeling in its episodic context). Propositional content will be described according to its stimulus (for example, a kind of flower growing in the garden, a sculpture put into some place, etc.), to the interaction where it is produced and, more crucially, to the level of memory (procedural/semantics/episodics) it involves. These are the variables that will be then compared in using usual statistics between paired AD and control subjects at visit 1 and 2</description>
