    <textblock>
      This is a two-center (University of Colorado, University of California San Francisco)&#xD;
      community-based comparative effectiveness study of outpatient palliative care for Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD) and related disorders (progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal&#xD;
      degeneration (CBD), multiple systems atrophy (MSA), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD). In September&#xD;
      2018, the study was amended to also include Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders&#xD;
      (Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), Vascular Dementia). It&#xD;
      will utilize a randomized stepped-wedge design to compare patient and caregiver outcomes&#xD;
      between usual care in the community versus usual care augmented by palliative training and&#xD;
      telemedicine support to provide other resources (e.g. social work).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative illness affecting&#xD;
      approximately 1.5 million Americans and is the 14th leading cause of death in the United&#xD;
      States. PD is traditionally described as a movement disorder with characteristic motor&#xD;
      symptoms (e.g. tremor). However, more recent research demonstrates the impact of nonmotor&#xD;
      symptoms such as pain, depression, and dementia on mortality, quality of life (QOL), nursing&#xD;
      home placement and caregiver distress. Regarding models of care for PD, evidence suggests&#xD;
      that care including a neurologist results in lower mortality and nursing home placement than&#xD;
      care solely from a primary care physician. Unfortunately, there is also significant evidence&#xD;
      that many of the needs most important to PD patients and their caregivers (e.g. depression,&#xD;
      planning for the future) are poorly addressed under current models of care. Palliative care&#xD;
      is an approach to caring for individuals with life-threatening illnesses that focuses on&#xD;
      addressing potential causes of suffering including physical and psychiatric symptoms,&#xD;
      psychosocial issues and spiritual needs. While developed for cancer patients, palliative care&#xD;
      approaches have been successfully applied in other chronic progressive illnesses including&#xD;
      heart failure and pulmonary disease. To date there have been minimal attempts to apply these&#xD;
      principles to PD although evidence suggests that PD patients' unmet needs under current&#xD;
      models of care may be amenable to palliative care. A small but growing cadre of centers offer&#xD;
      outpatient palliative care for PD with early evidence of efficacy and a randomized trial of&#xD;
      an academic-based outpatient palliative care is underway led by investigators on this&#xD;
      proposal. While this work is critical to forwarding this field, further work is needed to&#xD;
      provide a model that can be widely disseminated. The current proposal addresses this gap by&#xD;
      assessing the effectiveness and feasibility of a novel community-based intervention that&#xD;
      empowers community neurology practices to improve care for PD patients and caregivers through&#xD;
      palliative care training, coaching and telemedicine resources. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that this intervention will improve patient QOL and caregiver burden and will prove feasible&#xD;
      and acceptable to community providers. The investigators Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine&#xD;
      the a) effectiveness and b) feasibility of a novel community-based outpatient palliative care&#xD;
      intervention for PD.; 2) Describe the effects of a this intervention on patient and caregiver&#xD;
      costs and service utilization; and 3) Identify opportunities to optimize community-based&#xD;
      palliative care for this population by: a) describing patient and caregiver characteristics&#xD;
      associated with intervention benefits; and b) through direct patient, caregiver and provider&#xD;
      interviews. Innovations of the investigators approach include a novel model of providing&#xD;
      disease-specific community-based palliative care not dependent on limited palliative&#xD;
      specialist resources, a stepped-wedge trial design and use of telemedicine resources to&#xD;
      provide multidisciplinary care. The research is significant because it will create a&#xD;
      foundation for future community-based dissemination studies in PD and the broader field of&#xD;
      palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In September 2018, supplemental support from NIH was granted in order to explore outcomes&#xD;
      among an Alzheimer's dementia population. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common&#xD;
      neurodegenerative illness affecting 10% of adults over age 65. This incurable and&#xD;
      relentlessly progressive disease affects approximately 1.5 million Americans and is the 6th&#xD;
      leading cause of death in the United States. Care for community-dwelling patients with AD is&#xD;
      typically focused on the assessment and pharmacologic management of cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      symptoms, although there is growing recognition of the need to expand care to address other&#xD;
      issues, including advance care planning. There is significant evidence that many of the most&#xD;
      important needs of the AD patients and their caregivers are poorly addressed under current&#xD;
      models of care, including management of medical and psychiatric symptoms (e.g. pain and&#xD;
      depression), caregiver support, advance care planning, and spiritual wellbeing. Importantly,&#xD;
      while the top goal of care for the majority of patients is avoidance of institutionalization,&#xD;
      our current models of care invest more resources in institutionalized patients rather than&#xD;
      proactively supporting community-dwelling individuals which may prevent institutionalization&#xD;
      and reduce overall healthcare costs. Our supplemental study will thus additionally target&#xD;
      this population for a 12-month period.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a stepped-wedge design, meaning that during the first year all patients enrolled will continue to receive usual care provided by their neurologist, who is also enrolled in the study. During years 2 and 3, every 6 months, 4-5 neurologists will receive training in supportive and palliative care. The timing of the training will be randomly assigned. Once their neurologist has received training, all of their enrolled patients will be switched to the intervention arm, and be eligible for additional care via telemedicine with the university supportive and palliative care team. During the final year of the study, all the neurologists will have received care, and all of their patients will be in the intervention arm.&#xD;
On a separate level, we will be evaluating the effects of training on the enrolled neurologists through assessments of palliative skills, knowledge, and attitudes before and after the training, as well as through qualitative interviews.</intervention_model_description>
