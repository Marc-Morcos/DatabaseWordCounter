  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VIVA study is focused on Alzheimer's disease patients with a low vision due to a&#xD;
      bilateral cataract. The aim is to study cataract surgery results on patients' autonomy,&#xD;
      behaviour, and mood. In fact those dement elderly patients suffer from a progressive loss of&#xD;
      superior functions, with loss of autonomy, behaviour and mood degradation, associated with&#xD;
      physical disabilities. The work hypothesis is that a loss of sensorial functions,&#xD;
      particularly visual, is an aggravating factor of NEURO-cognitive troubles and absence of&#xD;
      communication with outside circle. The protocol consists in investigating superior functions,&#xD;
      autonomy, and behaviour troubles of the participating patients, with the help of a series of&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests used one month before and three months after cataract operation on&#xD;
      the eye with the worst vision. Independently of the study, patients must have given an&#xD;
      informed consent to cataract surgery. Their participation lasts 4 months+/- 1 month. The aim&#xD;
      of the study is to evaluate whether the cataract surgery improves patients' behaviour,&#xD;
      autonomy and mood and possibly to show evidence onf drawbacks in of such a practice.The main&#xD;
      objective targets to cataract surgery benefice on patients suffering from both Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease and impeding cataract, aiming to improve behaviour troubles. The specific objective&#xD;
      is to measure this benefice in correlation with visual acuity improvement.&#xD;

      VIVA study aims to evaluate cataract surgery results on Alzheimer patients regarding&#xD;
      behavior, autonomy and mood. Patients studied are elderly people suffering from both&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and low vision due to a bilateral impeding cataract. Designed patients&#xD;
      come from Ile-de-France-area geriatrics departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: the trial consists in a series of neuropsychological tests involving both subject of&#xD;
      the study and a close parent one-month before and three months after surgery of the most&#xD;
      affected eye. Each patient is under investigation during 4+/1 months. The tests used are the&#xD;
      MMS (Mini Mental Status), ADAS-cog Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale for cognitive&#xD;
      functions, NPI (Neuropsychiatric Inventory) for behavior troubles, IADL (Instrumental&#xD;
      Activities of Daily) for autonomy evaluation, GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale) or Cornell&#xD;
      Scale (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia) for mood troubles. All data are registered&#xD;
      along as well as medical treatments and severe side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical method:An ophthalmologic surgery department head operates on the patients at&#xD;
      National Ophthalmologic Hospital &quot;QUINZE VINGT&quot; in Paris.The surgery involves the eye with&#xD;
      the worst vision. Study analysis does not take into account the results of the second eye&#xD;
      intervention. The surgery consists in a phacoemulsification and setting of an acrylic implant&#xD;
      in the posterior chamber. Patients care consists in the usual procedures. The intervention is&#xD;
      performed under regional anesthesia exceptionally general anesthesia. A three-day&#xD;
      hospitalization is regular considering patients' fragility.The aim of the study is to analyze&#xD;
      3 months after cataract surgery, the different neuropsychological tests, with the help of&#xD;
      appropriate statistics. The main endpoint criterion will be the NPI-test improvement between&#xD;
      the one-month test before surgery and the three-month test after. A correlation between&#xD;
      visual acuity improvement and NPI-test improvement will be verified. The second endpoint&#xD;
      criterion will be the study of other scores (MMS, IADL, ADAS-cog, GDS or Cornell test), in a&#xD;
      matched-way. If improvement is noted, a regression logistic study will permit to study&#xD;
      improvement predictive factors. Each participant will take part in the study during 4+/-1&#xD;
      months.Study rationale and literature data abstract.Cataract treatment, restoring a better&#xD;
      visual function, is greatly beneficial upon life quality of elderly people, as largely&#xD;
      demonstrated (1, 2). Several studies, based on cognitive functions, daily life activities,&#xD;
      and mood, showed a significant amelioration of elderly people operated on for cataract, in&#xD;
      comparison with those who refused the intervention (3). Benefice is less in case of ocular co&#xD;
      morbidity or in some very old patients (4).Cataract surgery on elderly patients suffering&#xD;
      from cognitive decline has given rise to very few studies. Nevertheless, correlation between&#xD;
      low vision and cognitive alteration is well established. In France, a Health High Authority&#xD;
      (HHA) report devoted to cataract surgical treatment evaluation, based on literature data and&#xD;
      experts opinion, was published in 2000 (6). The report dealt with the taking in care of&#xD;
      demented or low mental capacities patients. It regretted that very few trials were undertaken&#xD;
      for this problem.. In case of beginning dementia, the experts thought that cataract surgery&#xD;
      visual benefice is limited. It seldom improves lecture but allows patients to watch&#xD;
      television more and makes contacts with neighbors easier. In case of advanced dementia, the&#xD;
      authors thought that surgery would worsen rapidly patients. The report evoked as well the&#xD;
      paternalistic decisions taken without any dialogue with the involved patient and raised&#xD;
      ethical issues. Still to-day, in case of dementia, the cataract management remains an actual&#xD;
      problem. This is a challenge for closes, guardians, geriatrics', ophthalmologists and&#xD;
      sometimes the decision is opposed to patients' feelings (8).One of the studies cited in the&#xD;
      HHA report, based on few low-vision patients, showed after cataract surgery, a light&#xD;
      improvement of mental status, everyday life but poor results on depression. After surgery,&#xD;
      patients felt that they were not as fragile as they had thought, that they endured the&#xD;
      operation and felt better after (9). In 2003, a Japanese study dealt with cognitive functions&#xD;
      of 40 demented patients suffering from cataract. Results and showed that among the 20&#xD;
      patients who chose to be operated on, 60% were improved, 35% were unchanged, and 5% worsened&#xD;
      (10). By extensive neuropsychological investigations on Alzheimer' patients, the VIVA study&#xD;
      would show the impact of visual function improvement on cognitive functions, psychological&#xD;
      and behavioural troubles, autonomy, and mood perturbations. Pointing out the objectives upon&#xD;
      improvement of neuropsychiatric survey, namely the NPI test, the study would permit to&#xD;
      precise the low-vision cataract role on patients' comportment troubles which are a cause of&#xD;
      burn-out for caring people. It is clearly demonstrated that delirious manifestations, notably&#xD;
      visual hallucinations are frequent in demented persons and in patients with low vision as&#xD;
      well (9). In low-vision patients, it seems that only the cataract is significantly linked to&#xD;
      visual hallucinations (10). The VIVA study aims to show also the benefice of a better visual&#xD;
      function on behavioural non-disturbing troubles such as apathy and inhibition. Therefore, we&#xD;
      would like to stress the cataract management benefits on Alzheimer's disease patients.&#xD;
      Particularly, we intend to precise the extent of expected patients' improvement and to&#xD;
      measure the correlation with visual acuity improvement&#xD;
