  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention program proof-of-concept was assessed as a single-arm, within-subjects&#xD;
      clinical study with a target enrollment of 10 participants with possible or probable amnestic&#xD;
      MCI. The protocol required participants to complete a pre-intervention assessment within two&#xD;
      weeks of beginning the intervention, attend seven, one-hour intervention group sessions&#xD;
      across six weeks, complete a post-assessment and interview in the final week of the&#xD;
      intervention, and complete weekly surveys throughout the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the proof-of-concept phase is to use pre-post comparisons to determine if&#xD;
      the treatment package can produce clinically significant improvements. Thus, our goal was to&#xD;
      assess whether the MI-CBT KNA program influenced adherence to KN and cognitive outcomes. Of&#xD;
      note, recruitment for the trial occurred in the weeks leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic,&#xD;
      which substantially altered the original intervention and assessment design due to&#xD;
      restrictions on in-person human subject research. While the original protocol included&#xD;
      in-person assessments and group meetings, collection of multiple biological samples (i.e.,&#xD;
      lipid panels, basic vitals, inflammatory biomarkers), and weekly health assessments, these&#xD;
      in-person components were modified or removed for completion during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
      Pre-assessment and screening appointments described below were completed in-person prior to&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, we completed pre-intervention neuropsychological assessments&#xD;
      with participants at baseline prior to beginning the trial; however, immediately following&#xD;
      baseline assessments, we fully revised the protocol to include only online, video, and phone&#xD;
      contact. We moved the KNA program to an online platform (HIPAA-compliant Zoom), and&#xD;
      assessments were changed to online surveys and video assessments. Individual testing of the&#xD;
      video platform was completed prior to the trial, which successfully reduced technical&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MI-CBT KNA Program proof-of-concept was assessed as a single-arm, within-subjects&#xD;
      clinical study with a target enrollment of 10 participants with possible or probable amnestic&#xD;
      MCI. The protocol required participants to complete a pre-intervention assessment within two&#xD;
      weeks of beginning the intervention, attend seven, one-hour intervention group sessions&#xD;
      across six weeks, complete a post-assessment and interview in the final week of the&#xD;
      intervention, and complete weekly surveys throughout the intervention. Participants were&#xD;
      mailed materials, including the participant workbook and food, macronutrient, and ketone&#xD;
      logs. Participants were also sent two bottles of ketone urine test strips for daily testing&#xD;
      and materials to complete follow-up assessments. Throughout the program, participants were&#xD;
      instructed to titrate into full ketosis across the first four weeks of the program by&#xD;
      gradually reducing total carbohydrate intake and increasing healthy fat intake (e.g., fish,&#xD;
      nuts, avocado, olive oils etc.). Thus, participants were not expected to attain measurable&#xD;
      ketone levels until the final weeks of the program.&#xD;
