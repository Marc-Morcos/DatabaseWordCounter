  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether Moving Together improves quality of life in people with memory loss&#xD;
      (PWML) and caregivers (CG) by performing a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) with a waitlist&#xD;
      control group in 224 dyads.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform an RCT with a 12-week delayed start control group in 224 dyads&#xD;
      of PWMLs and CGs. The primary outcome in PWML will be self-rated quality of life (Quality of&#xD;
      Life in Alzheimer's Disease, QOL-AD). Secondary outcomes will include: a) self-reported&#xD;
      emotional well-being; b) self-reported social isolation; c) self-reported mobility; and d)&#xD;
      directly assess cognitive performance. In CGs, the primary outcome will be self-rated quality&#xD;
      of life (SF-12). Secondary outcomes in CGs will include: a) healthy days; b) self-efficacy;&#xD;
      c) burden; d) social isolation; e) ability to self-regulate; f) positive affect; and g) sleep&#xD;
      quality. In addition, the investigators will ask CGs to report sleep quality, mobility, and&#xD;
      cognitive function for PWML. Additional exploratory outcomes will include health services&#xD;
      utilization (hospitalizations, emergency department visits) and falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the RCT, the investigators propose to compare health utilization outcomes in&#xD;
      study participants to a matched 'no contact' comparison sample of patients with dementia&#xD;
      diagnoses who receive care in the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Health&#xD;
      system.&#xD;

    <description>The Immediate Start group will participate in the 12-week Moving Together program after completing the baseline assessment. Moving Together is a gentle, live-streaming, group movement program designed specifically for people with memory loss (PWML) and caregivers (CG) to do together. It is based on the in-person Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLIÉ) and Paired PLIÉ programs. The program combines physical movements to help maintain daily function with mindful body awareness exercises and social interactions to provide a comprehensive, multi-domain program.</description>

    <description>Two-way livestreaming virtual group classes will be offered for 1 hour, 2 days/week for 12 weeks to all participants. Classes will be led by a trained instructor who will demonstrate all movements and will provide brief explanations for the goals of movements. Consistent with the in-person program, classes will focus on the 7 guiding principles of Moving Together:&#xD;
repetition with variation (to promote procedural learning);&#xD;
progressive, functional movements (to improve daily function);&#xD;
slow pace and step-by-step instruction (to minimize cognitive demands);&#xD;
participant-centered goal orientation (to enhance personal meaningfulness of movements);&#xD;
body awareness, mindfulness and breathing (to encourage present-centeredness);&#xD;
social interaction (to promote meaningful connection); and&#xD;
positive emotions (to promote feelings of well-being.</description>
