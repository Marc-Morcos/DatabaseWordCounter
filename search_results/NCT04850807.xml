      The purpose of this trial is to test the effects of a personalized music intervention (Music&#xD;
      and Memory, Inc.) on agitated and aggressive behaviors for nursing home residents with&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a parallel, pragmatic, cluster randomized control&#xD;
      trial of personalized music (Music and Memory) for nursing home residents with moderate to&#xD;
      severe dementia living in 54 nursing homes (27 treatment, 27 control) from 4 nursing home&#xD;
      corporations. Music and Memory is a personalized music program that uses portable music&#xD;
      players to deliver individualized music to people with dementia at times when agitated&#xD;
      behaviors are likely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **This funding mechanism sponsored two parallel trials with different implementation&#xD;
      strategies. In this trial, music is preloaded on personalized music devices to increase&#xD;
      nursing use of the music with residents. Details of the first parallel trial conducted under&#xD;
      this funding mechanism are registered under &quot;R33AG057451_part1.&quot;**&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are: 1. To use a train-the-trainer model to implement the intervention&#xD;
      with ongoing monitoring of the program's adoption and acceptance by nursing home residents&#xD;
      with dementia; 2. To estimate the impact of Music and Memory on agitated and aggressive&#xD;
      behaviors; and 3. To examine factors associated with variation in providers' adherence to the&#xD;
      implementation of Music and Memory.&#xD;

    <measure>Frequency of agitated and aggressive behaviors (staff report)</measure>
    <time_frame>8-months</time_frame>
    <description>The tool used to interview staff about resident behaviors is the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Research staff interview nursing staff who knows the resident well to ask how frequently 29 agitated/aggressive behaviors occurred in the past week. There are seven response choices for each item, anchored from never (1) to several times per hour (7). Total scores on the CMAI range from 29 to 203, with higher scores representing more frequent agitated/aggressive behaviors. The CMAI is administered at three points in time: baseline, 4 months, and 8 months. The minimum of the 4- and 8-month scores will be the study outcome for intervention and control participants. The minimum observed frequency of agitated and aggressive behaviors after intended exposure to the intervention (treatment) or after 8-months (control), conditional upon survival to at least one post-intervention observation (up to 4 months after baseline measurement).</description>

    <measure>Frequency of agitated and aggressive behaviors (administrative data)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Aggressive Behavior Scale is a 4 item measure describing the frequency of physical behavioral symptoms directed toward others; verbal behavioral symptoms directed toward others; other behavioral symptoms not directed toward others; and behaviors related to resisting necessary care. For each item, frequency in the past week is reported as: behavior not exhibited (0); behavior occurred 1-3 days (1); behavior occurred 4-6 days (2); or behavior occurred daily (3). The Aggressive Behavior Scale ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more frequent agitated and/or aggressive behaviors. Mean total scores will be compared for treatment and control populations.</description>

    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire is a 9-item screening assessment for depression severity. For each item, respondents indicate the frequency of the symptom in the past 2 weeks using the following choices: never or one day (0); 2-6 days (1); 7-11 days (2); or 12-14 days (3). Total scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating more frequent depressive symptoms. Average total scores will be compared for treatment and control populations.</description>
