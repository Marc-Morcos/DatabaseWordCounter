      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of 2 intervention delivery&#xD;
      strategies for increasing moderate physical activity (MPA), real-time group video&#xD;
      conferencing (RGV) vs. enhanced usual care (EUC), in community dwelling adults with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's diseases (AD) and their caregiver (dyads) over 18 mos. (6 mos. active, 6 mos.&#xD;
      maintenance, 6 mos. no contact). The primary outcome is to compare total MPA (min/wk.),&#xD;
      assessed using ActiGraph, in adults with AD from baseline to 6 mos. Secondary aims for the&#xD;
      Adults with AD are to compare MPA (min/wk), sedentary time (min/wk.), percentage meeting 150&#xD;
      min/wk. goal, functional fitness, activities of daily living (basic/instrumental), quality of&#xD;
      life, residential transitions, and cognitive function across 18 months between RGV and EUC.&#xD;
      Secondary aims for the caregivers are to compare total MPA (min/wk.), sedentary time&#xD;
      (min/wk.), functional fitness, quality of life, caregiver burden across 18 months between RGV&#xD;
      and EUC. Additionally, as an exploratory aim, this study will evaluate the influence of&#xD;
      process variables/participant characteristics on MPA in adults with AD and their caregiver&#xD;
      across 6, 12 &amp; 18 mos.: age, sex, BMI, attendance (exercise/support sessions), use of&#xD;
      recorded videos, PA self-monitoring, peer interactions during group sessions, caregiver&#xD;
      support, type and quality of dyadic relationship, and number of caregivers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will compare 2 strategies for the delivery of an intervention to increase moderate&#xD;
      physical activity (MPA) in community dwelling adults with AD and their caregiver (dyads);&#xD;
      real-time group video conferencing (RGV) vs. enchanced usual care (EUC). Adults (age ≥ 55&#xD;
      yrs.) with mild to moderate AD (n=100) and their caregiver (n=100) will be randomized (1:1)&#xD;
      to one of the 2 intervention arms for an 18-mo. trial (6 mos. active intervention, 6 mos.&#xD;
      maintenance, 6 mos no contact). Cohorts of ~20 dyads will be recruited and computer&#xD;
      randomized. Dyads will be stratified by the sex of the person with AD, and sequentially&#xD;
      randomized by the study statistician with equal allocation to the RGV or EUC arms.&#xD;
      Participants in both arms will be provided with an iPad® for intervention delivery, Fitbit&#xD;
      (Fitbit Inc., San Francisco, CA) for self-monitoring MPA, and will be asked to complete 150&#xD;
      min of MPA/wk. Dyads in the RGV arm will be asked to complete three 45 min sessions that&#xD;
      include aerobic, resistance, and balance/coordination exercises delivered by a trained health&#xD;
      coach via Zoom® software on an iPad during mos. 0-6, and 1 session/wk. during mos. 7-12 to&#xD;
      groups of 5-8 dyads in their home. Dyads in the EUC arm, will be given a recommended exercise&#xD;
      plan to follow own their own. Dyads in both arms will be provided with written materials&#xD;
      regarding exercise and physical activity from the National Institute on Aging and will be&#xD;
      asked to complete brief (15-20 min) FaceTime meetings (0-6 mos.= 2/mo.; 7-12 mos.= 1/mo.)&#xD;
      with the heath coach to discuss progress, provide support and receive additional guidance on&#xD;
      how to increase MPA. All outcomes will be collected by trained research assistants who are&#xD;
      blinded to the study condition. The primary outcome, total MPA, will be assessed, in both&#xD;
      individuals with AD and caregivers, by Actigraph at baseline, 3, 6, 12 &amp; 18 mos. All&#xD;
      secondary/exploratory outcomes will be assessed at the individual with AD or caregivers' home&#xD;
      at baselines, 6, 12, and 18 months. Secondary outcomes for the individual with AD are&#xD;
      sedentary time, functional fitness, activities of daily living, quality of life, residential&#xD;
      transition, and cognitive function. Secondary outcomes for the caregiver are sedentary time,&#xD;
      functional fitness, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The exploratory outcomes are age,&#xD;
      sex, BMI, attendance (exercise/support sessions), use of pre-recorded videos, PA&#xD;
      self-monitoring, peer interactions during group sessions, caregiver support, type and quality&#xD;
      of dyadic relationship, and number of caregivers. This trial is powered to detect a&#xD;
      between-arm difference (RGV vs. EUC) of 10 min./d. in MPA. This difference represents&#xD;
      additional 70 mins. of MPA/wk. in the RGV arm. Power analysis shows that 84 participants&#xD;
      (42/arm) would provide 81% power to test an overall between-arm difference across time, i.e.,&#xD;
      group effect. This sample size would also provide ≥ 80% power to detect a between-arm&#xD;
      difference in change, i.e., group-by-time interaction, as small as f = 0.10. Thus,&#xD;
      conservatively assuming a high attrition rate of 20%, the study team will recruit 100 dyads&#xD;
      at baseline to assure the final sample size requirements are achieved, i.e., final N ≥ 84&#xD;
      (thus, power ≥ 80%) with attrition up to 20%. General mixed modeling for repeated measures&#xD;
      will be utilized to evaluate the primary aim to compare total MPA (min/wk.) across the 6 mo.&#xD;
      active intervention in adults with AD and their caregiver randomized to the RGV and EUC&#xD;
      interventions. A similar mixed modeling analysis will be conducted to examine the secondary&#xD;
      aim. General mixed models will be fitted for the two arms combined to examine the association&#xD;
      for the process variables/participant characteristics with MPA. However, if there is a&#xD;
      significant between-arm difference in MPA, the investigators will determine whether the&#xD;
      process variables/participant characteristics amplify or attenuate the RGV effect, i.e.,&#xD;
      moderation, by testing a 2-way interaction with the group effect and/or a 3-way interaction&#xD;
      with the group-by-time interaction term.&#xD;
