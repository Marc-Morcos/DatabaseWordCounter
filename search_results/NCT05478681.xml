    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess acceptability, and safety of providing tDCS to ADRD&#xD;
      patients with behavioral symptoms and to assess the efficacy of tDCS for ADRD-related&#xD;
      symptoms, mainly behavioral symptoms.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in apathy as assessed by the Brief Dimensional Apathy Scale (b-DAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 and Week 12.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consists of 9 questions each one scored from 0(almost always) to 3(hardly ever), higher scores indicate more apathy</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depressive symptoms as assessed by the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 and Week 12.</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire has 19 questions and each is scored from 0(absent) to 2(severe). A total score greater than 10 indicates probable major depressive episode and a score of greater than 18 indicates definite major depressive episode</description>

    <measure>Change in cognition as evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 and Week 12.</time_frame>
    <description>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) includes memory, language, praxis and orientation tasks, yielding a global cognition score ranging 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better performance.</description>

    <description>All participants will receive active tDCS with a constant current intensity of 2mA. Anodal tDCS will be applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while cathodal electrode will be positioned on the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Caregivers will help setting up and administering tDCS for participants with AD at home. tDCS will be applied for 30min at an intensity of 2mA, with 30 s ramping up and down.</description>
