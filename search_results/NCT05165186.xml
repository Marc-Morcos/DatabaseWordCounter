  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to compare knowledge, decisional conflict,&#xD;
      preferences, and caregiver burden over time caregivers of Alzheimer's Disease and Related&#xD;
      Dementias (ADRD) patients by comparing the effectiveness of a video decision aid intervention&#xD;
      and enhanced usual care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial in 150 caregivers of patients&#xD;
      with ADRD, who will be randomized to either the video (intervention) or enhanced usual care&#xD;
      (informational sheet, control). The intervention group will use the suite of video decision&#xD;
      aids. Caregivers in the control group will review the informational sheet, which covers the&#xD;
      same information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection is estimated to take no longer than an hour and will be conducted after the&#xD;
      scheduled visit at the Massachusetts General Hospital Memory Disorders Unit (MGH MDU) clinic.&#xD;
      The relatively brief interviewing time (30 minutes) in which the survey is conducted should&#xD;
      assure completion of the interview without burdening participants. The investigators do not&#xD;
      foresee the additional time to complete the survey to be a barrier to successful recruitment&#xD;
      and completion of the protocol. Participants will be provided written copies of the questions&#xD;
      in order to follow along during the face-to-face interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research assistant (RA) will collect baseline data, randomize caregivers to either the&#xD;
      video or control arm via concealed envelopes, and administer the intervention. After this&#xD;
      baseline interview and randomization, the RA will collect the remaining outcomes data&#xD;
      regarding knowledge, preferences, decisional uncertainty, and caregiver burden from the&#xD;
      caregiver. For those participants randomized to the video intervention, they will also be&#xD;
      asked questions regarding the usefulness of the video and their comfort with the video. All&#xD;
      caregivers will be given a website link to access the videos shown from their home. As the&#xD;
      investigators have done in prior studies, the investigators will contact by telephone&#xD;
      caregivers at 3 and 6 months to assess their caregiver burden at that time. Fidelity of the&#xD;
      video intervention during the in-person survey and remotely at home will be tracked via a&#xD;
      video website link that documents show-rates (date and time video accessed) as well as&#xD;
      play-through rates (was the video watched to completion).&#xD;

    <description>The Knowledge of Advanced Dementia Questionnaire is a verbally administered self-reported instrument assessing knowledge with six true/false questions with a total possible score of 6 (1 point for each correct T/F), with high scores indicating better knowledge. A confidence rating scale with possible scores from 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (extremely confident).&#xD;

    <description>The PANAS is a validated self-report instrument assessing affect. Possible answers range from 1 (Very slightly or not at all) to 5 (Extremely) The total score is calculated by finding the sum of the 10 positive items and then the 10 negative items. Scores range from 10 - 50 for both sets of items. For the total positive score, a higher score indicates more of a positive affect. For the total negative score, a lower score indicates less of a negative affect.&#xD;
