  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy young and elderly adult volunteers who meet the criteria, will be treated single and&#xD;
      multiple ascending dose of BEY2153 or placebo orally. Food effect evaluation study will be&#xD;
      conducted with single ascending dose. After the single ascending dose study, independent&#xD;
      external experts will review blinded data and multiple ascending dose study will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
