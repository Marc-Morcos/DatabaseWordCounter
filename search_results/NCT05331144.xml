  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      (SBP), using FDA approved medications (antihypertensive), reduces Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      pathology (i.e., excessive brain amyloid and tau protein deposition) in older adults at high&#xD;
      risk for memory decline or dementia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IPAT study is a 2-arm open-label randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of&#xD;
      intensive pharmacological reduction of high blood pressure (SBP) on brain amyloid and tau&#xD;
      protein deposition (Alzheimer's Disease pathology) in older adults who are at high risk for&#xD;
      AD and related dementias, that is, those who have high blood pressure, family history of&#xD;
      dementia, or subjective memory complaints. Furthermore, IPAT will examine effects of&#xD;
      intensive blood pressure lowering on brain volume, perfusion, and neural network connectivity&#xD;
      using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive performance.&#xD;
