  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Daily Study of Caregiving Relationships and Health is to learn how&#xD;
      caregiving relationships and social connectedness are associated with dementia caregivers'&#xD;
      health, health behaviors, and diurnal patterns of salivary cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study wherein the purpose is to test the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      study protocols.&#xD;

      The purpose of the Daily Study of Caregiving Relationships and Health is to learn how&#xD;
      caregiving relationships and social connectedness are associated with dementia caregivers'&#xD;
      health, health behaviors, and diurnal patterns of salivary cortisol. Investigators are asking&#xD;
      caregivers to complete 14-days of surveys which ask about their relationships and health&#xD;
      behaviors, in addition to 2 longer surveys (baseline and 3-month follow up). Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that on days when caregivers receive more emotional support, they will report&#xD;
      better health behaviors (e.g., improved sleep quality). On days when caregivers experience&#xD;
      greater 1) strain and 2) loneliness, they will report poorer health behaviors. Information&#xD;
      about which aspects of social relationships and social connectedness most affect health will&#xD;
      be used to inform interventions programs.&#xD;
