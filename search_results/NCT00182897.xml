  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is documentation of effectiveness of a home-based intervention&#xD;
      to reduce caregiver burden related to dementia caregiving, improve caregiver health status,&#xD;
      and reduce caregiver and care recipient resource utilization.&#xD;

      This study focuses on an underserved, understudied population: African American and White&#xD;
      homebound persons with dementia and their caregivers (CGs). Severe dementia, frailty,&#xD;
      multiple disabling co-morbid diseases, lack of transportation, inability to afford or obtain&#xD;
      a sitter for the care recipient (CR), and lack of time in a CG's burdened daily schedule may&#xD;
      prevent care dyads (caregivers and their family member with dementia) from receiving services&#xD;
      in primary care settings and from participating in clinical studies. Homebound issues may be&#xD;
      particularly important for African American CGs, yet the minority CG literature has not&#xD;
      addressed relevant issues for homebound dyads. Nor are the chronic needs of homebound&#xD;
      dementia care dyads adequately attended by the current home health care system, which now&#xD;
      focuses on skilled nursing care. This study has been designed to address these research&#xD;
      deficits. The study will examine the benefit (through improving depression, anxiety, and&#xD;
      health perception) and the cost-effectiveness of home-based dementia caregiving&#xD;
      interventions, with attention to both the informal care provided by the CG and the use of&#xD;
      formal care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care dyads will be randomized to either Usual Care or Enhanced Care. Both Usual Care and&#xD;
      Enhanced Care caregivers will receive usual home health care delivered by home health nurses&#xD;
      on the schedule determined by the patient's needs and set by the home care agency. For the&#xD;
      Enhanced Care caregivers, to ensure protocol adherence, using the same schedule as the home&#xD;
      health visits, trained interventionists from the research staff will deliver the&#xD;
      intervention. The interventionists will teach dementia family caregivers to cope with&#xD;
      difficult care recipient behaviors and challenges to caregiving and will teach caregivers how&#xD;
      to cope with their own responses to caregiving. Following established protocols and using&#xD;
      fifth grade level pamphlets and educational material, the interventionists will tailor the&#xD;
      intervention sessions to meet the individual needs of each care dyad in their own home&#xD;
      environment. Enhanced Care sessions will not exceed 60 minutes. Research specialists will&#xD;
      perform data collection visits in the care dyads' homes at baseline, within 2 weeks of home&#xD;
      care ending and six months.&#xD;
