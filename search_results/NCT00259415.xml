      This study is a collaborative effort between a community-based service organization,&#xD;
      Supportive Older Women's Network (SOWN), and an academic research division at Thomas&#xD;
      Jefferson University (TJU). We plan to use a randomized controlled two-group design to: 1)&#xD;
      test the effectiveness of the intervention at 6 months to enhance social support and&#xD;
      perceived efficacy in comparison to a control group; 2) test if gains are sustained over 12&#xD;
      months (within experimental group comparison); and 3) evaluate the cost and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention. Three secondary study aims are to describe the process and&#xD;
      content of tele-support groups (dose/intensity, support group topics); evaluate the relative&#xD;
      benefits for African American and White females; and determine if control group subjects&#xD;
      benefit from receiving a peer's telephone number for mutual support (within group comparison&#xD;
      between 6 and 12 months).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caregivers will be recruited for study participation who fit the following criteria:&#xD;
             1) female, 2) 55 or older, 3) has been a caregiver for a minimum of 6 months, 3)&#xD;
             provides care to a person with a physician's diagnosis of ADRD, 4) has weekly access&#xD;
             to a telephone for one hour without interruption during working hours, or if unable to&#xD;
             have uninterrupted time, willing to have home-maker service. Homemaker service during&#xD;
             the tele-group meetings will be arranged by the recruitment source. For this study, we&#xD;
             plan to recruit only females since they represent the majority of those providing care&#xD;
             to persons with ADRD and have been shown to demonstrate significantly more stress and&#xD;
             negative health outcomes than male caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  under age of 55&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  not a caregiver of person with ADRD&#xD;
