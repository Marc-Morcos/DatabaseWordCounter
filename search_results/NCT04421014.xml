      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Alzheimer s disease (AD) the brain cannot use glucose as a fuel. The brain can use ketones&#xD;
      as a fuel instead of glucose. Researchers want to test a supplement, Ketone Ester (KE). It&#xD;
      may improve brain metabolic function and cognition in normal people and, perhaps, down the&#xD;
      road, in patients with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the change in brain ketone levels in people after 28 days of taking KE compared with&#xD;
      baseline and placebo. Also, to study changes in cognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 55 years old or older with metabolic syndrome and no cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 4 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened at Visit 1 with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the study supplement or a placebo&#xD;
      with same amount of calories. Neither they nor the researchers will know which they receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 will include repeats of some screening tests. It will also include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool sample (brought from home)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI/MRS: Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of a scanner. A coil will be&#xD;
      placed over their head. They may be asked to perform leg exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First dose of study supplement or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 2 weeks after Visit 2, Visit 3 will include blood and urine tests and a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 2 weeks after Visit 3, Visit 4 will include repeats of the Visit 2 tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will drink the study supplement or placebo 3 times per day during the study.&#xD;
      They will keep a daily log of each dose. They will bring the log to Visits 3 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will by contacted by phone once per week during the study to see how they are&#xD;
      doing.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that supplementation with a ketone ester drink [Ketone Ester (KE)] compared to&#xD;
      placebo, in cognitively intact adults &gt;= 55 years old with Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), will&#xD;
      (i) increase peripheral and brain ketone levels [primarily beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and&#xD;
      secondarily acetoacetate (AcAc)], (ii) improve neuronal/astrocytic insulin resistance (IR)&#xD;
      and induce a change in neuronal/astrocytic metabolism as reflected on blood Extracellular&#xD;
      Vesicle (EV) biomarkers, (iii) improve cognitive performance, (iv) boost mitochondrial&#xD;
      function in muscle, and (v) change gut microbiome. These effects will be examined acutely,&#xD;
      after single-dose administration, and chronically, after 28 days on the supplement x 3 times&#xD;
      per day. The changes in EV biomarkers and cognition will be associated with the elevation of&#xD;
      ketones in brain. The study will involve a Screening Visit and three additional Visits to&#xD;
      assess acute effects, compliance and chronic effects, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To investigate the change in brain concentration BHB, using brain Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Spectroscopy, after 28 days of supplementation with the KE, compared to baseline and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: None. Additional endpoints will be exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary: To detect with brain MRS, a significant change in the concentration of&#xD;
      BHB, after 28 days of supplementation with the KE compared to baseline and placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: None. The other endpoints will be exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Males or females, of age &gt;= 55 years who meet the criteria for MetS and are&#xD;
      cognitively intact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: N/A - study of a dietary supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at a single site, at the NIA Clinical Unit at the Medstar Harbor&#xD;
      Hospital, Baltimore&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral KE drink [containing 25 g KE/(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3- hydroxybutyrate] vs isocaloric&#xD;
      Placebo drink (containing dextrose) x 3 times/day x 28 +/- 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 25 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 59 days (Screening Visit is followed by an initiation visit within 28 days and then 28&#xD;
      3 days receiving the drink supplement).&#xD;

    <description>The main ingredient of the Ketone Ester drink [(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate)] is regulated as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) substance by the FDA (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fdcc/index.cfm?set=GRASNotices&amp;amp;id=515). The Ketone Ester compound is already being sold in the market as a ketogenic supplement and is especially popular among athletes, such as cyclists (sold by the official website of the company TdeltaS(R) Global (https://www.deltagketones.com/products/g-ketone-performance). The dose and formulation (25 g of KE contained in 59 ml of a drink), daily scheme (3 times daily) and total duration (28 days) are identical to a previous safety human study. The Ketone Ester drink provided by DeltaG will be repackaged by the NIA Pharmacist into new bottles identical to the ones that will be used for the placebo to ensure the blinding of participants and researchers to the drink.</description>

             osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and/or fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5.3 INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children: No inclusion is planned. This study aims to investigate the effects of aging&#xD;
             55 years old) on brain metabolism, therefore inclusion of children is inappropriate&#xD;
             with respect to the purpose of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant Women, Fetuses, or Neonates: No inclusion is planned. We will exclude women,&#xD;
             fetuses or neonates with respect to the health of participants, specifically, due to&#xD;
             the risk associated with the MRI procedure and the unknown effects of the ketone ester&#xD;
             supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners: No inclusion is planned. This study involves several visits to the NIA&#xD;
             Clinical Unit, which prisoners are unable to perform. Therefore, inclusion of&#xD;
             prisoners is inappropriate with respect to the purpose of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Decisionally Impaired Adults: No inclusion is planned. Cognitive intact status will be&#xD;
             ascertained at baseline based on Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0, and Montreal&#xD;
             Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) &gt; 26, since the main objective of the study is to study a&#xD;
             population of cognitively intact individuals. Therefore, inclusion of decisionally&#xD;
             impaired adults is inappropriate with respect to the purpose of the research.&#xD;
             Moreover, participants are not expected to become decisionally impaired over the&#xD;
             course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NIH Employees: We intend to include NIH staff (to include NIH contractors and special&#xD;
             volunteers, guest researchers and trainees) in this study. The staff will be invited&#xD;
             to participate through standard recruitment efforts. Participation will be voluntary&#xD;
             and neither participation nor refusal to participate will have an effect, either&#xD;
             beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or position at NIH. We will&#xD;
             follow the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Employees in NIH Research Studies and will&#xD;
             give each employee a copy of the NIH information sheet on Staff Research Participation&#xD;
             per NIH OHSRP SOP 14F.4: Research Involving NIH Staff as Subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neither participation nor refusal to participate will have an effect, either&#xD;
             beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or work situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The NIH information sheet regarding NIH employee research participation will be&#xD;
             distributed to all potential subjects who are NIH employees.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The employee subject s privacy and confidentiality will be preserved in accordance&#xD;
             with NIH Intramural policies, which define the scope and limitations of the&#xD;
             protections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects that are employees/staff will be consented in the usual manner. The inclusion&#xD;
             of employees or staff is not anticipated to affect the research outcome; therefore, if&#xD;
             the subject is a co-worker (including a supervisor, subordinate or coworker) the&#xD;
             subject may be consented by another co-worker and/or subordinate.The study PI will not&#xD;
             be involved in the consenting of employees or staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other vulnerable populations: No inclusion is planned.&#xD;
