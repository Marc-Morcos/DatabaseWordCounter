    <textblock>
      The study examines subjects where there might be an indication for Amyloid-PET according to&#xD;
      the Criteria defined by the Amyloid Imaging Task Force. In these subjects the impact of a&#xD;
      Flutemetamol (Vizamyl)-Positron-Emission-Tomography -Scan (PET) on clinical management and&#xD;
      disease course will be studied over 6 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dementia expert considers an Amyloid-scan appropriate according to Amyloid-imaging&#xD;
             task force criteria (AIT) after conference with an Amyloid-PET expert&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preambles of the AIT-Criteria are fulfilled&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A cognitive complaint with objectively confirmed impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. AD as a possible diagnosis, but when the diagnosis is uncertain after a&#xD;
                  comprehensive evaluation by a dementia expert&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. When knowledge of the presence or absence of Abeta pathology is expected to&#xD;
                  increase diagnostic certainty and alter Management&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients with persistent or progressive unexplained MCI&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients satisfying core clinical criteria for possible AD because of unclear&#xD;
                  clinical presentation, either an atypical clinical course or an etiologically&#xD;
                  mixed presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients with progressive dementia and atypically early age of onset (65 years or&#xD;
                  less in age)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. other situations where preambles of AIT-Criteria are fulfilled&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis was established in a memory clinic or by an experienced physician in&#xD;
             dementia diagnostics&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnostic procedures comprise in minimum MRI, neuropsychology, routine blood test&#xD;
             for exclusion of symptomatic causes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MMSE &gt;15&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Competency to consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Trial partner willing to support study physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent by both patient and trial partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understanding of German language&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treating physician willing to collaborate with the study team&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive impairment which can be attributed to another underlying medical condition&#xD;
             that renders a possibility of Alzheimer's disease very unlikely (thus violating&#xD;
             preamble B)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant Depression (decided upon clinical assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PET exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Allergy to Flutemetamol or any of the excipients of the solution for injections&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. History of severe allergic reactions to drugs or allergens&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Pregnancy or lactation&#xD;
