  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), double-blinded, placebo-controlled study where&#xD;
      healthy subjects are randomly allocated to receive APNmAb005 or placebo. Approximately 5&#xD;
      dosing groups (cohorts) are planned with 8 subjects (randomized to 6 active: 2 placebo) per&#xD;
      cohort. the starting dose of APNmAb005 is 5 mg/kg and the anticipated doses for subsequent&#xD;
      cohorts are 10, 25, 50 and 70 mg/kg. A Safety Review Team (SRT) will review data on an&#xD;
      ongoing basis throughout the study and before progression to the next dose level cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a single dose of either APNmAb005 or placebo administered as a single&#xD;
      IV infusion on Day 1 of the study and will remain in the study center until Day 3 (48 hours&#xD;
      after dosing). They will return to the study center for 7 outpatient visits. The duration of&#xD;
      the study, excluding screening, is approximately 71 days.&#xD;
