  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the effect on the progression of Alzheimer's Disease of a surgically&#xD;
      implanted shunt (tube) to increase the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and improve the clearance&#xD;
      of potential neurotoxins from the fluid bathing the brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the protective fluid that fills the empty spaces around the&#xD;
      brain and spinal cord. CSF is naturally produced and absorbed, but with age abnormal&#xD;
      metabolism and clearance of amyloid beta proteins can lead to accumulation of these proteins,&#xD;
      resulting in plaque formation, a leading contributor to the progression of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD). The shunt treatment is designed to drain CSF with these toxic elements from the&#xD;
      skull and allow replenishment of normal CSF. This clinical study is designed to determine if&#xD;
      this device will stop or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COGNIShunt® System is a proprietary device designed to increase the flow of cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF) and improve clearance of putative neurotoxins from the CSF that are believed to&#xD;
      contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease symptoms. This clinical study is&#xD;
      designed to determine if this device will stop or slow the progression of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. The pivotal study is a prospective, randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the effect of flow-regulated ventriculoperitoneal CSF drainage with the&#xD;
      COGNIShunt® system on cognitive and clinical function in approximately 250 participants with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease (NINDS/ADRDA criteria). Study participants will be permitted to continue&#xD;
      anti-dementia drug therapy if their drug regime has been stable for 3 months prior to entry.&#xD;
      This is a two-part study. In Part I, participants will be randomized to receive either a&#xD;
      functioning COGNIShunt® System (test/intervention group) or an occluded shunt&#xD;
      (control/placebo group). The duration of Part I is nine months, to be followed by an&#xD;
      extension phase of an additional 9 months, constituting Part II. During Part II, subjects&#xD;
      with occluded shunts have the opportunity to receive a functioning COGNIShunt®, so that all&#xD;
      study participants may have open devices during Part II. The total duration of the study is&#xD;
      18 months. Visits to the site include: for screening and baseline (may be done in one or two&#xD;
      visits); surgery; and a visit the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th month after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
