  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to find out whether a new image analysis technique called Cortical&#xD;
      Disarray Measurement (CDM) could be used to help better diagnose Alzheimer's disease. This&#xD;
      study will see whether changes on CDM can be used to identify Alzheimer's disease from a&#xD;
      group of people living with memory and thinking problems. The study will also explore how CDM&#xD;
      relates to changes in memory or thinking over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre observational longitudinal cohort study to evaluate and optimise the&#xD;
      Cortical Disarray Measurement (CDM) technique for diagnosis and prognosis in patients with&#xD;
      mild cognitive impairment and prodromal / mild Alzheimer's Disease. CDM is a novel MRI&#xD;
      analysis tool that quantifies cortical and regional diffusion tensor imaging signals in grey&#xD;
      matter to observe pathological changes related to neurodegeneration. Participants in this&#xD;
      study will be monitored for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the accuracy of CDM in detecting progressive change in cognitive and functional&#xD;
           measures over 2 years in participants presenting with mild cognitive impairment or early&#xD;
           dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the relationship between CDM (both cross-sectionally and longitudinally) and&#xD;
           change on standard cognitive and functional assessment measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore patient and companion views and experiences of the diagnostic journey for&#xD;
           dementia and their views on CDM implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the costs and consequences of introducing CDM-augmented MRI as a form of&#xD;
           early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in people presenting with MCI or mild AD compared&#xD;
           to current practice.&#xD;

    <measure>CDR Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Study day 1) to month 24</time_frame>
    <description>CDR Progression defined as a binary variable (yes/no) indicating either an increase in global outcome on Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (which takes value 0, 0.5, 1, 2 or 3, with higher scores reflecting more severe dementia), or an increase greater than, or equal to, 2 points on CDR Sum of Boxes (which takes values from 0 to 18 with higher values indicating a worse outcome)</description>
