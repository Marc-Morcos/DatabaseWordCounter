  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is common in older adults after inpatient surgery and may be associated with&#xD;
      cognitive decline. Advances in surgical and anesthetic techniques have led to increasing&#xD;
      numbers of older adults undergoing surgery on an outpatient basis. However, few studies have&#xD;
      investigated cognitive disorders of older adults before or after ambulatory surgery.&#xD;
      Increased age and pre-existing cognitive impairment are strong risk factors for cognitive&#xD;
      decline after surgery, yet older adults are not screened for cognitive impairment before&#xD;
      surgery. Existing screening tools require specially trained staff for test administration and&#xD;
      in-person testing. Virtual cognitive screening has not been evaluated in surgical patients.&#xD;
      In this study, investigators will determine the feasibility of using Cogniciti's Brain Health&#xD;
      Assessment (BHA) - a validated online cognitive screening tool that can be self-administered&#xD;
      from a patient's home before surgery - to screen older adults before ambulatory surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults (≥60 years of age) are the fastest growing age group in Canada, and by the year&#xD;
      2026, will constitute more than 1 of every 5 Canadians. World-wide, about 703 million people&#xD;
      are ≥65 years of age, and this number is projected to double to 1.5 billion in 2050. Higher&#xD;
      life expectancy and advancements in anesthetic techniques have led to more older adults with&#xD;
      high burdens of co-morbidities to undergo ambulatory surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 40-53% of all surgeries performed are on patients &gt;65 years of age.&#xD;
      Neurocognitive disorders (NCD) are common in the community with 14-48% of those &gt;age 70 years&#xD;
      suffering mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impairments in cognitive ability are the most common complications in older adults undergoing&#xD;
      major surgery. These impairments include 1) delirium (which may last up to 7 days after&#xD;
      surgery), 2) delayed neurocognitive recovery (cognitive decline up to 30 days after surgery)&#xD;
      3) Neurocognitive disorder (postoperative) mild or major (30 days to 12 months after&#xD;
      surgery). The decline in executive function, memory, and other cognitive domains may last for&#xD;
      weeks to months after surgery. While most patients recover from cognitive impairment, a small&#xD;
      minority of patients have persistent impairment. Older adults who are diagnosed with PND have&#xD;
      longer hospital length of stay, are less likely to be discharged home, increased health care&#xD;
      costs, and a higher incidence of mortality at one year after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that it is feasible to utilize the BHA to screen for NCDs, and to&#xD;
      assess cognitive changes in elderly patients undergoing elective ambulatory surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Since participants in previous studies on cognitive screening are usually more educated individuals with higher income, participants who do not have proficiency/or access to a computer will be asked to complete some questionnaires to determine any sociodemographic or baseline differences between patients who are able to complete BHA vs. those who are not able to complete BHA.</description>

    <intervention_name>Brain Health Assessment</intervention_name>
    <description>BHA is a free, self-administered online cognitive screening test developed in Toronto at Baycrest (www.cogniciti.com). BHA has been validated against a gold standard neuropsychological assessment for detecting amnestic MCI (aMCI) - the most common type of MCI - in community dwelling older adults. BHA has high sensitivity (.78), specificity (.78), PPV (.82), NPV (.74), and was better than MoCA for identifying aMCI. ROC curves showed an AUC of 0.75 for detecting aMCI from normal subjects. BHA measures memory and executive attention processes sensitive to subtle cognitive changes associated with normal aging and MCI. BHA can be completed from a patient's home or can be self-administered in hospital.</description>

    <description>PHQ-2 is a shortened version of PHQ-9 which is originally a component of the longer Patient Health Questionnaire. The tool incorporates DSM-IV depression criteria and other leading major depressive symptoms into brief self-reported instruments. PHQ-2 inquires about the degree to which an individual experiences depression and anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure) over the past two weeks. The tool is not for final diagnosis of depression or monitoring its severity but only for the purpose of screening for the condition.The questionnaire comprises of the first two questions from PHQ-9, each item is scored 0-3. Therefore, the PHQ-2 score ranges from 0-6.</description>

    <intervention_name>AFT</intervention_name>
    <description>AFT is a free, rapid cognitive assessment commonly used to assess semantic language ability. Language is one of the earliest functions affected by AD and naming and semantical knowledge seems to be particularly affected. The identification of language deficits may pick up signs of neurological decline preceding the appearance of clinical symptoms. Milder forms of cognitive impairment such as MCI may also show language deficits if language is one of the domains affected.</description>

    <description>GAI-SF is a 5-item questionnaire derived from the original 20-item Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI).In the population of community dwelling older women GAI-SF was developed in, a cut-off score of 3 yields a specificity of 87% and sensitivity of 75%. This highly accessible questionnaire is suitable for everyday use in a range of health-care settings. It has been employed amongst older adults in primary care settings, nursing homes, geriatric psychiatry patients and amongst clinical geriatric participants with co-morbid anxiety and unipolar mood disorder and their controls.</description>

    <description>Instrumental activities such as preparing meals or managing finances allow individuals to maintain their health while living on their own. The IADL measures the ability of older adults to manage their daily activities, as well as the impact, if any, cognitive decline would have on these activities. Scores range from 0-5 for men, and 0-8 for women, with higher sores being more independent and higher functioning.</description>

    <description>FAM-CAM was derived from the CAM instrument in order to screen for delirium by interviewing family members or caregivers of the patient. They are asked specific questions about any new or sudden changes in the patient's activity, behavioural or cognitive status. FAM-CAM showed good sensitivity and specificity in the original study where caregivers of elderly patients with pre-existing cognitive impairment were interviewed.</description>

    <description>The 4AT is a rapid tool for delirium detection that has previously been used in a surgical setting. The 4Ats test for the patient's alertness, mental state, attention, and signs of acute change. Across 17 studies, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of 4AT was 0.86 and 0.89. The 4AT will be administered after the patient has completed surgery, prior to discharge.</description>

    <intervention_name>Clinical Frailty Scale</intervention_name>
    <description>CFS is a 9-item scale that uses clinical descriptors and pictographs and is an easily applicable tool to stratify older adults according to level of vulnerability. The CFS divides patients into 9 classes from very fit (CFS = 1) to terminally ill (CFS = 9). It is easy to use and may readily be administered in a clinical setting, an advantage over the tools previously developed. The scale helps in objective early identification of older adults with frailty in acute care units and helps to target interventions to prevent complications and to implement effective discharge planning.</description>
