  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In prior work, this team developed a telehealth primary care model (TIPC), designed in close&#xD;
      partnership with patients and clinicians to address a widespread increase in telehealth use&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research team will test the TIPC intervention to assess&#xD;
      support for patients among a population of persons with dementia (PwD) over the course of 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's aims are 1) to explore the impact of the TIPC intervention on patient-important&#xD;
      outcomes, engagement with community-based support provided through insurers, advanced care&#xD;
      planning (primarily identification of health-care proxy), and patterns of hospice and&#xD;
      healthcare utilization in the target population and 2) to evaluate patient, caregiver, and&#xD;
      clinical team perspectives of feasibility and acceptability of a TIPC model, and apply&#xD;
      findings from this work to the development of a larger randomized control trial designed to&#xD;
      assess long-term efficacy of TIPC intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in 3 deaths for those over the age of 65 are caused by Alzheimer's or related dementia.&#xD;
      Lack of goals-of-care conversations with these patients drives up end-of-life healthcare&#xD;
      costs due to excessive use of medical procedures and places unnecessary decision-making&#xD;
      burden on caregivers. Such realities exhibit how existing models of specialty palliative care&#xD;
      are suffering too great of a workforce shortage to adequately meet the needs of increasing&#xD;
      numbers of PwD and are also inaccessible to underrepresented minorities (URMs) due to cost.&#xD;
      Implementing a TIPC model could improve these outcomes through intersectional engagement of&#xD;
      relevant health entities to carve more concrete care goals and drive down overall care cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will enroll 50 patients from Jefferson (and possibly their caregivers, if they&#xD;
      have one). Half of the patient participants will be given the TIPC intervention and all&#xD;
      participants will be assessed over 12 months to assess changes in patient-important outcomes.&#xD;
      For both groups, the researchers will evaluate goal attainment, quality of life, decision&#xD;
      making, caregiver support/burden, and clinician/payor satisfaction. Assessments will be&#xD;
      ongoing throughout the year (baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) to fully illustrate what kind&#xD;
      of sustained impact or change in trajectory this brief intervention may have, and if other&#xD;
      gaps are later identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient participants will be recruited from Jefferson through an EMR report generating&#xD;
      potentially eligible patient names and contact information. Patient participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to study groups (25 intervention, 25 control). If a patient is randomized&#xD;
      to the intervention group, researchers will ask if they have a caregiver so that they may be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study as well. Intervention subjects will partake in two telehealth visits as&#xD;
      a part of the TIPC model. The first telehealth visit will focus on ACP and identifying&#xD;
      patient-important outcomes via a web-based tool for discussion with a palliative care (PC)&#xD;
      specialist. The second telehealth visit will involve patient communication of their patient&#xD;
      important outcomes (PIOs) to a primary care provider (PCP) and the translation of those PIOs&#xD;
      into care plans for ongoing management. Control subjects will be followed as they continue&#xD;
      with their usual standard of care. They will also complete all measures at pre-specified time&#xD;
      points and researchers will assess for changes in GAS, provider burden and decision making as&#xD;
      well as hospitalizations, hospice, palliative care plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient/caregiver dyads assigned to the intervention group will be interviewed remotely&#xD;
      after the intervention via survey to assess their goal attainment, satisfaction with care and&#xD;
      connectivity to community resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of patient outcomes of the TIPC model will be ongoing and through an&#xD;
      assets/strengths-based framework. At baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, patient quality of&#xD;
      life, decision-making, and caregiver support/burden will be measured through a series of&#xD;
      follow-up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, the degree to which intervention subjects felt each of their PIOs&#xD;
      was met will be self-reported by the patient/caregiver. Patient satisfaction will also be&#xD;
      self-reported by intervention subjects 1 month post-telehealth visit 2 in a short interview&#xD;
      to determine how well the intervention targeted health inequities amongst AA/URM populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To substantiate intervention impact on patients, both clinical and implementation outcomes&#xD;
      (payor engagement, changes in level of care, recurrent hospitalizations, transition to&#xD;
      hospice, intervention uptake, PCP satisfaction) will be measured and evaluated 6+ months&#xD;
      post-intervention via retrospective data review. This is with the exception of PCP&#xD;
      satisfaction which is to be self-reported following the same acceptability measures as the&#xD;
      intervention subjects.&#xD;

The first TIPC visit will center around the patient setting care goals for themselves and their caregiver with the help of a palliative care physician.
