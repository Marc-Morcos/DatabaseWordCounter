  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. Subjects for&#xD;
      participation in this study will be identified by the Investigator based on their Clinical&#xD;
      Dementia Rating score which will be completed as part of standard practice. Patients meeting&#xD;
      the criteria for early Alzheimer's disease will be considered for study participation, with&#xD;
      the Investigator taking the additional inclusion/exclusion criteria into consideration. Up to&#xD;
      40 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects participating in the study will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either gummies containing L-Serine or placebo gummies, with the Investigator and&#xD;
      study staff blinded to the group assignments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      L-serine (C3H7NO3; 105.09 g/mol; synonym (S)-2-amino-3-hydroxypropanoic acid) is a&#xD;
      naturally-occurring dietary amino acid. It is abundant in soy products, some edible seaweeds,&#xD;
      sweet potatoes, eggs, and meat. Since some L-serine is produced by astrocytes in the brain,&#xD;
      it is considered a non-essential amino acid. L-serine is directly involved in the&#xD;
      biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and other amino acids. Serine residues are found in&#xD;
      most proteins and within proteins function as a site for phosphorylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-serine is considered as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the FDA and has been&#xD;
      approved as a normal food additive under CFR172.320. It is widely sold as a dietary&#xD;
      supplement. A pilot study of L-serine supplementation of 14 patients with hereditary sensory&#xD;
      neuropathy has been published, and subsequent trial is on-going (ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
      identifier NCT01733407). The authors did not report adverse effects at doses of 400mg/kg/day,&#xD;
      which for an average American of 75.5kg is about 30 grams, the dose which we propose to use&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-serine will be administered orally through gummies being produced in a GMP compliant&#xD;
      facility (Knechtel, Chicago, IL). Each gummy contains 1 g L-serine (treatment) and will be&#xD;
      packaged in a foil packet containing 15 pieces to be taken both morning and evening for nine&#xD;
      months. The placebo will be a gummy containing no L-serine, packaged and taken in the same&#xD;
      manner. In order to assess tolerability in patients, we have designed a 4 week dose ramp-up.&#xD;
      We will monitor side-effects and amino acid balances in blood samples in the early&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease patients during a dose ramp-up period. If a patient cannot tolerate the&#xD;
      full dose of gummies, they will remain in the study taking a total of 1 package of gummies&#xD;
      split into two time periods within the day. The same ramp-up schedule and procedures will be&#xD;
      observed for both placebo and L-serine patients. Patients will be assessed at baseline, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, and 9 months.&#xD;
