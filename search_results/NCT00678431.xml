    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the elderly&#xD;
      is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and certain neuropathological features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is great interest in the well-documented mitochondrial (oxidative) lesion in&#xD;
      AD. Disturbed oxidative metabolism is a well described abnormality in AD. Several&#xD;
      observational studies have shown that moderate consumption of wine is associated with a lower&#xD;
      incidence of Alzheimer's disease (Truelsen et al., 2002; Luchsinger et al., 2004). Wine is&#xD;
      enriched in antioxidant compounds with potential neuroprotective activities. In the early&#xD;
      1990s the presence of Resveratrol in red wine was detected where it is suspected to afford&#xD;
      antioxidant and neuroprotective properties (Miller and Rice-Evans, 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blass and Gordon (2004) have demonstrated positive effects in AD with an oral preparation of&#xD;
      glucose, malate and resveratrol. Glucose is the physiological precursor of the substrates of&#xD;
      oxidative metabolism in the brain, malate is a primer of the energy-providing Krebs-cycle.&#xD;
      Glucose and malate therefore can provide reducing equivalents (electrons) to regenerate the&#xD;
      reduced form of resveratrol, and do so under the normal regulation of brain cell metabolism.&#xD;
      All three ingredients are classified by the FDA as Generally Recognized As Safe.&#xD;

      Subjects will be assessed by their capacity to consent by a psychiatrist independent of this&#xD;
      study. Subjects who are determined to have capacity will sign consent. For subjects&#xD;
      determined to lack capacity consent will be obtained from their surrogate. Subjects lacking&#xD;
      in capacity must nonetheless provide verbal assent to participation in this study. After&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained, subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Screening comprises of medical history, physical exam, neurological exam, and a MMSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the above are performed for research purposes. Further evaluation of medical problems&#xD;
      that are identified in the course of screening will be obtained as part of standard clinical&#xD;
      care. For example, if an abnormality requiring further evaluation is detected on blood tests&#xD;
      the subsequent evaluation will be conducted as standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be baseline within 4 weeks. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will not be asked to stop any medication they may currently be on before the study begins.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either a mixture of glucose, malate and&#xD;
      resveratrol (RGM) or placebo. At baseline, medical history, physical exam, cognitive tests&#xD;
      are obtained. An ECG and a panel consisting CBC, electrolytes, liver and renal function tests&#xD;
      will be drawn at the screening visit. Clinical information is obtained from the identified&#xD;
      caregiver. The study drug (RGM or placebo, depending on which group the subject is randomly&#xD;
      assigned to) is dispensed at baseline. Follow up visits at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 months&#xD;
      require physical exam and some cognitive measures. At Month 12 a neurological exam will be&#xD;
      performed. Adverse events are collected at each visit. Medication compliance is assessed at&#xD;
      months 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and unused study drug is retrieved. At Month 12 unused study&#xD;
      drug is retrieved and no more study drug is dispensed. Clinical information is obtained from&#xD;
      the caregiver at each visit. At the Month 12 visit, a questionnaire will be completed by the&#xD;
      study staff, subject and study partner to assess the adequacy of medication blinding. As&#xD;
      noted all of the above tests and procedures are part of the research protocol. At study&#xD;
      termination the subject will be referred to ongoing clinical care as appropriate.&#xD;
