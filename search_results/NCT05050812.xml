  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Grounding (Earthing) refers to the practice of contacting the Earth or a properly installed&#xD;
      grounding mat with the body. Previous studies on grounding have shown positive effects&#xD;
      body-wide inflammation, acute and chronic pain, and immune system response. Prior studies on&#xD;
      the inflammatory process of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, and some other dementias have shown connections between immune system dysregulation,&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, and severe disease progression. Finding ways to mitigate or turn off&#xD;
      the inflammatory response is key to treating mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of sleeping grounded on&#xD;
      cognition and personal perceptions in participants with a diagnosis of mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment due to Alzheimer's disease as evidenced by a battery of assessments using&#xD;
      Cogstate's Cognitive Brief Battery and a qualitative questionnaire. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      assessment scores will improve with grounding and that perceptions will positively correlate&#xD;
      with an increase in scores. Modulation of risk factors like glucocorticoid resistance, SCI,&#xD;
      and immune system dysfunction through grounding may lead to an accessible, natural technique&#xD;
      for neurodegenerative disease prevention or treatment.&#xD;

      Grounding (Earthing) refers to the practice of contacting the Earth or a properly installed&#xD;
      grounding mat with the body. Previous studies on grounding have shown positive effects on&#xD;
      diurnal cortisol regulation, systemic chronic inflammation (SCI), immune system response,&#xD;
      acute and chronic pain, mood, vagal tone, blood viscosity, blood flow, recovery from muscle&#xD;
      strain and damage, and prevention or mitigation of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases. Prior studies on the inflammatory process of mild cognitive impairment due to&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and some other dementias have shown connections&#xD;
      between immune system dysregulation, inflammatory markers, and severe disease progression.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of sleeping grounded on cognition and&#xD;
      personal perceptions in participants with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment due to&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (MCI/AD) as evidenced by a battery of tests using the Cogstate platform's&#xD;
      Cognitive Brief Battery (CBB) and a qualitative questionnaire to detect any correlations to&#xD;
      the participant's perceptions of sleep quality, mood, pain, and overall well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will both fulfill the requirement for a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and lay&#xD;
      the foundation for further research into grounding and neurodegenerative diseases. My senior&#xD;
      research project methodology is a mixed methods research design with a triangulation&#xD;
      convergence, since I'll be concurrently collecting, analyzing, and evaluating the results of&#xD;
      the quantitative and qualitative measurements before comparing, integrating, and interpreting&#xD;
      the outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I have three hypotheses. First, I hypothesize that sleeping while grounded will result in&#xD;
      improved scores on the Cogstate battery of tests given at baseline and weekly for three&#xD;
      weeks. Second, I hypothesize that sleeping while grounded will result in positive perceptions&#xD;
      regarding sleep quality, mood, pain, and overall well-being. Finally, I hypothesize that&#xD;
      improved Cogstate scores will positively correlate with perceptions of sleep quality, mood,&#xD;
      and overall well-being and negatively correlate with pain. The independent variable is the&#xD;
      intervention (grounded sleeping mat), and the dependent variables are the three measurements&#xD;
      of cognition (memory, working memory, and processing speed) and the qualitative questionnaire&#xD;
      to evaluate how the participants feel about their sleep quality, mood, pain, and overall&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population for this study will be adults aged 55 and up (N=8) with a current&#xD;
      diagnosis of MCI/AD who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. I will employ a mixed&#xD;
      methods research design that includes statistical analysis of empirical data and a&#xD;
      qualitative questionnaire. I will use a triangulation convergence, since I'll be concurrently&#xD;
      collecting, analyzing, and evaluating the results of the quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      measurements before comparing, integrating, and interpreting the outcomes. First, I will look&#xD;
      at the percentage of change in each testing area from week to week and calculate the&#xD;
      statistical significance (p &lt; .01) of any changes. Second, I will calculate the mean of all&#xD;
      the test scores per day (baseline and weekly X 3) to obtain a general cognition score which I&#xD;
      will also use to calculate statistical significance (p &lt; .01) of changes over time. Third, I&#xD;
      will perform a simple linear regression analysis to determine if a correlation exists between&#xD;
      the intervention and the cognition scores after baseline. Finally, I will perform an analysis&#xD;
      of the qualitative questionnaire using in vivo coding to determine if any correlations exist&#xD;
      between the cognition scores and personal perceptions. For this study, I will interpret the&#xD;
      results based on changes in test scores over time, changes in general cognition scores over&#xD;
      time, and positive/negative correlations of the personal perceptions and cognition scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will receive an Earthing Elite™ sleep mat kit which they get to keep. The&#xD;
      sleeping mat will be installed wherever the participant sleeps (bed or recliner), and I will&#xD;
      ensure that the mat is properly attached to the grounding plug and confirm grounding using a&#xD;
      multimeter with two terminal leads, a cord with alligator clips on both ends, an Earthing&#xD;
      coil cord, and an outlet checker. This procedure will show body voltage prior to grounding&#xD;
      and while grounding to confirm that the setup is working and that body voltage has been&#xD;
      neutralized. I will return for repeat assessments after one week, two weeks, and three weeks&#xD;
      at which time I will verify that the system is still working properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All computerized testing will consist of the following assessments on the Cogstate platform:&#xD;
      1) Detection test (psychomotor function); 2) Identification test (attention); 3) One Card&#xD;
      Learning test (visual learning); and 4) One Back test (working memory). The personal&#xD;
      perceptions qualitative questionnaire will consist of several open-ended and scaled questions&#xD;
      designed to assess how the participants perceive various subjective areas such as sleep&#xD;
      quality, pain, mood, and overall well-being. Each participant will complete the questionnaire&#xD;
      first before completing the computerized cognition assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modulation of risk factors like glucocorticoid resistance, SCI, and immune system dysfunction&#xD;
      through grounding may lead to an accessible, natural technique for neurodegenerative disease&#xD;
      prevention or treatment.&#xD;

                  not fluent in English;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Have a current diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
                  made by a medical doctor;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Be able to spend at least 6 hours per 24-hour period sleeping or resting on the&#xD;
                  grounded mat;&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All approved participants must&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Not have a diagnosis or conversion to AD or any other type of memory disorder&#xD;
                  before or during the study period including but not limited to dementia, Lewy&#xD;
                  body disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's&#xD;
                  disease, vascular cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementias, primary&#xD;
                  progressive aphasia, autoimmune encephalopathy, and normal pressure&#xD;

               4. Not have any history of grounding consistently for more than 60 minutes/day in&#xD;
                  the past year. This includes natural methods and the use of any grounding&#xD;
                  devices;&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Not have any in-the-moment assessment that leads the investigator to believe that&#xD;
                  the participant is not fully aware or does not understand what is being asked of&#xD;
                  them. Again, this is a vulnerable population, and I will exclude or cut any&#xD;
                  participant who shows signs of confusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Not be taking or have taken in the previous 30 days any of the following&#xD;
                  medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. daily anti-inflammatories, prescription or over the counter;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. blood pressure medications (anti-hypertensives);&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. blood thinners (anti-coagulants);&#xD;
&#xD;
                  e. glucose control medications; f. thyroid medications; g. anti-convulsive&#xD;
                  medications (no matter the diagnosis); h. any type of monoclonal antibody; i. any&#xD;

               7. Inability to answer the questions in the initial screening interview;&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Inability to follow instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A Note About Medications and Grounding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Earthing has been proven to reduce inflammation, thin the blood, lower blood pressure,&#xD;
        lower and better regulate glucose levels, and improve thyroid function. While all those&#xD;
        things are generally sought after, there could be dire consequences if a participant is on&#xD;
        a medication to correct any of those conditions, so in the interest of safety, exclusion&#xD;
        based on certain medications is necessary. In that same vein, if any participant must begin&#xD;
        a medication during the study period, that participant will be disqualified in the interest&#xD;
        of safety.&#xD;
