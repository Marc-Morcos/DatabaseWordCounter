  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to evaluate Aftobetin-HCl and florescence detection as measured&#xD;
      by the Sapphire II device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance of Part I of the study has been completed (15 subjects received a single&#xD;
      administration of Aftobetin HCL followed by Sapphire II measurements) and indicated that 3&#xD;
      administrations of Aftobetin-HCl are necessary. For Part II, a second group of up to 30&#xD;
      subjects (CN =10 and mild AD or MCI =20) will receive three Aftobetin HCL administrations. If&#xD;
      three administrations of Aftobetin HCL are optimal, up to an additional 30 MCI and 30 mild AD&#xD;
      subjects will be entered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study as Part II is performed is to determine the ability of the Sapphire&#xD;
      II device to detect B-amyloid in the lens of the eye in subjects with Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (MCI), and mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD) after three Aftobetin-HCl&#xD;
      administrations. Subjects with Normal Cognition (CN) will also be tested to further establish&#xD;
      that subjects who are highly unlikely to have B-amyloid deposits in the lens of the eye will&#xD;
      have close to baseline post ligand fluorescent uptake value (FUV) using the Sapphire II&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Open label study. 45-105 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete physical and neurologic examination (Screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing (Screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ophthalmologic examination (Screening and Visit 4 (Safety follow up visit))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of ointment - 3 administrations (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sapphire II Fluorescent Eye Measurements (Visits 1-3): Prior to first administration of&#xD;
           ointment and then 24 +/- 2 hours, 28 +/- 30 minutes and 48 +/- 2 hours following first&#xD;
           ointment administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amyvid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Amyloid Scan (only required for MCI and mild&#xD;
           AD subjects who have not had a positive amyloid PET scan in the last 3 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be asked to participate in an elective second Sapphire II assessment to&#xD;
      assess its reproducibility. Repeatability testing is optional and will require a separate&#xD;
      consent. Subjects will come back for Visits 5-9 (ointment administration and eye scans and a&#xD;
      follow up safety assessment).&#xD;
