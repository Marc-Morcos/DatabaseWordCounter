    <textblock>
      There is a need for caregiver-initiated and -implemented non-pharmacological interventions&#xD;
      directly to and for the person with dementia, including environmental assessment and&#xD;
      modification, as first-line treatments for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia&#xD;
      (BPSD) in persons living with dementia (PLWD). Delivered via telehealth, Harmony at HOME&#xD;
      (H@H) aims to train caregivers of persons with moderate to severe ADRD in the skills of&#xD;
      assessing and modifying the home environment to promote &quot;person-environment fit,&quot; a concept&#xD;
      that posits that the ability to access features within a built environment (e.g. bathroom,&#xD;
      stairs,) or that factors within the environment itself (lighting, noise level, temperature),&#xD;
      especially when linked with individualized social support, contribute to or even shape&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the intervention, the first 10 caregiver participants to enroll will also be&#xD;
      invited to participate in two focus groups that will be facilitated during and after the&#xD;
      intervention. The first focus group focuses on experiences as a dementia caregiver in rural&#xD;
      areas. The second focus group focuses on providing feedback regarding caregivers'&#xD;
      perceptions, acceptability, and usefulness of the H@H intervention. These focus groups will&#xD;
      be conducted as structured interviews with open-ended questions that encourage participants&#xD;
      to share their experiences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral disruptions by individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD)&#xD;
      are reported in nearly 90% of persons living with ADRD. Such behavioral and psychological&#xD;
      symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are highly correlated with increased caregiver burden and&#xD;
      burnout, decreased quality of life for the person living with dementia and their caregiver,&#xD;
      institutionalization, and patient mortality. There is a need for caregiver-initiated and&#xD;
      -implemented non-pharmacological interventions directly to and for the person with dementia,&#xD;
      including environmental assessment and modification, as first-line treatments for BPSD in&#xD;
      persons living with dementia (PLWD). Delivered via telehealth, Harmony at HOME (H@H) aims to&#xD;
      train caregivers of persons with moderate to severe ADRD in the skills of assessing and&#xD;
      modifying the home environment to promote &quot;person-environment fit,&quot; a concept that posits&#xD;
      that the ability to access features within a built environment (e.g. bathroom, stairs,) or&#xD;
      that factors within the environment itself (lighting, noise level, temperature), especially&#xD;
      when linked with individualized social support, contribute to or even shape behavior. In&#xD;
      ideal circumstances, adults adjust or adapt to meet the demands of the environment; likewise,&#xD;
      in the ideal, environments are designed in ways that facilitate positive behaviors. ADRD&#xD;
      progressively interferes with an individual's capacity to self-optimize person-environment&#xD;
      fit; in such cases, caregivers have the opportunity to create a supportive environment that&#xD;
      negates some behavioral challenges and encourages functional activity engagement. H@H seeks&#xD;
      to help caregivers acquire the skills and sense of mastery that will enable them to create&#xD;
      such supportive environments within the homes of people with dementia. H@H will be tested&#xD;
      with caregivers and the person living with dementia in the Appalachian region of rural&#xD;
      Kentucky, a region with the poorest healthcare options for older adults in the country and&#xD;
      plagued with extremely high rates of co-morbid conditions, including ADRD. Access to quality&#xD;
      caregiver training, in-home caregiver support, and respite is significantly limited. This&#xD;
      pilot study will enable the investigators not only to establish the feasibility of the&#xD;
      program but to demonstrate this capacity with a population of caregivers and persons with&#xD;
      dementia that is in particular need and difficult to reach.&#xD;
