  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two of the most common types&#xD;
      of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Identifying at-risk patients and gauging disease&#xD;
      progression in a non-invasive manner would be invaluable. Early and correct diagnosis is&#xD;
      crucial for coordinating supportive care, patient expectations, caregiver arrangements and&#xD;
      family planning. In addition, as treatments become available, beginning therapy early in the&#xD;
      disease before symptoms become severe will be important. Multimodal ocular imaging (MOI)&#xD;
      includes an ophthalmic (eye) exam and eye photographs to evaluate different layers of the&#xD;
      retina, which is the light sensing layer of the eye. Newer technologies make it possible to&#xD;
      visualize the disease process occurring in AD and FTD by using MOI to look at the retina,&#xD;
      since the retina is fundamentally an outward extension of the brain itself. This study will&#xD;
      attempt to correlate signs of disease in the retina, as determined by MOI, with plaque&#xD;
      buildup in the brain as seen by imaging. This will demonstrate the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of MOI for diagnosing AD and FTD in a noninvasive manner.&#xD;
