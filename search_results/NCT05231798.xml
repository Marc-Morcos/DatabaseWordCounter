    <textblock>
      Progressive age-related cognitive deficits occurring in both AD and DS have been connected to&#xD;
      the degeneration of several neuronal populations, but mechanisms are not fully elucidated.&#xD;
      The most consistent neuronal losses throughout the progression of AD are seen in cholinergic&#xD;
      neurons where these losses negatively affect cognition, particularly in attention, learning,&#xD;
      and memory formation. Evidence of reduced cholinergic integrity in DS is largely limited to&#xD;
      animal models and post-mortem human data. The investigators propose to use molecular,&#xD;
      functional, and structural biomarkers to assess the cholinergic integrity in adults with DS.&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate using the data gathered in this pilot study to inform future&#xD;
      study designs to determine AD risk stratification in DS by identifying individuals who show&#xD;
      an accelerated decline in cholinergic integrity that correlates with cognitive and&#xD;
      neurobehavioral changes. Also, our cholinergic biomarkers may identify whether individuals&#xD;
      with DS are likely to respond to pro-cholinergic interventions, including the novel&#xD;
      cholinergic modulators that are being developed to enhance cholinergic-sensitive cognitive&#xD;
      functioning. The investigators anticipate using the data gathered here to inform future&#xD;
      treatment studies in TRC-DS and beyond where novel cholinergic treatments may offer&#xD;
      opportunities for early intervention in DS and be complementary to disease-modifying&#xD;
      approaches such as anti-amyloid treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Down syndrome (DS) or Trisomy 21, is the most common genetic cause of intellectual&#xD;
      disability. Among its consequences, by the age of 30, people with DS invariably develop&#xD;
      amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles such that up to 75% of people with DS will&#xD;
      develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD in DS is thought to be linked to the presence of three&#xD;
      copies of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, which resides on chromosome 21. This gene&#xD;
      leads to higher levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques. Preliminary data show that adults with DS&#xD;
      exhibit significant changes in AD-related biomarkers between the ages of 35-55. It is also&#xD;
      within this age range that AD-related cognitive decline and dementia typically manifest in&#xD;
      DS. AD is the primary cause of death in adults with DS over the age of 35. Although it is&#xD;
      currently suggested that the onset of dementia in DS is in part due to triplication of the&#xD;
      amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, other neurodegenerative features of sporadic AD may&#xD;
      occur in DS and these can aggravate the onset of cognitive decline and dementia. Progressive&#xD;
      cognitive deficits occurring in sporadic AD are associated with the degeneration of several&#xD;
      neuronal populations. Throughout the progression of AD, the most consistent losses are seen&#xD;
      in cholinergic neurons. While the loss of the cholinergic integrity has been established as a&#xD;
      critical biological process in sporadic AD, the cholinergic system has not been evaluated in&#xD;
      adults with DS to examine if age-related cholinergic decline can be detected in DS and&#xD;
      whether it is associated with the progression of AD pathologies and cognitive decline as seen&#xD;
      in sporadic AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a pilot study that aims to assess the integrity of the&#xD;
      cholinergic neurotransmission system using in-vivo structural, functional, and molecular&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination of the cholinergic system in DS and its relationship to aging and known AD&#xD;
      pathologies and cognitive decline would help validate whether the cholinergic decline is an&#xD;
      early marker of dementia risk in DS and proceeds or follows changes in standard AD imaging&#xD;
      and fluid biomarkers, thus helping establish how similar AD in DS is to that of sporadic AD.&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate using the data gathered here to inform future treatment studies&#xD;
      where novel cholinergic treatments may offer opportunities for early intervention in DS and&#xD;
      be complementary to disease-modifying approaches such as anti-amyloid treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To examine the molecular, functional, and structural biomarkers of cholinergic&#xD;
      integrity in Down syndrome (DS) in association with age, Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology,&#xD;
      and cognitive/neurobehavioral performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: The Center for Cognitive Medicine is a site for the Trial-Ready Cohort-Down&#xD;
      Syndrome (TRC-DS) study, to enable a systematic biomarker characterization of middle-aged and&#xD;
      older individuals with DS by using neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical measures, in&#xD;
      preparation for an AD-like prevention trial likely using anti-amyloid agents. The&#xD;
      investigators will leverage this cohort's well-characterized DS participants to initiate a&#xD;
      new pathway for investigating our novel cholinergic biomarker in 10 TRC-DS participants&#xD;
      (age:35-55) and enroll 110 additional adults with DS (age:18-55) outside of the TRC-DS study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use molecular, functional, and structural biomarkers to measure the&#xD;
      cholinergic integrity of adults with DS. These methods will include resting and task-related&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG), basal forebrain volumetric measures on structural magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) with a vesicular cholinergic&#xD;
      radiotracer known as fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ([18F]FEOBV).&#xD;
