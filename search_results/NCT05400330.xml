  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this long-term follow-up study is to assess the long-term safety&#xD;
      profile of APOE4 homozygote participants who were administered gene therapy (LX1001) for the&#xD;
      treatment of Alzheimer's disease in Study LX100101. A secondary objective is to assess the&#xD;
      biomarker as shown by the conversion of CSF APOE isoforms from APOE4 to APOE2-APOE4.&#xD;
      Additional secondary outcomes include amyloid PET scan, CSF markers (including Aβ42,&#xD;
      Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio T--tau, and P-tau), and quantitative MRI (and other biomarkers that may be&#xD;
      informative for this therapeutic approach). Other secondary objectives include instruments to&#xD;
      assess cognitive and clinical AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term follow-up study to evaluate the safety following LX1001, a gene therapy,&#xD;
      for participants who are APOE4 homozygotes with clinical diagnoses varying from MCI or&#xD;
      dementia due to AD who have previously received LX1001. Study LX1001-01 was designed to&#xD;
      assess the safety of LX1001 at 3 ascending doses (5.0 x 1010, 1.6 x 1011, 5.0 x 1011 gene&#xD;
      copy [gc]/mL CSF), with each group consisting of approximately n=5 individuals for a total of&#xD;
      approximately 15 participants for the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants who have received LX1001 in the parent protocol (LX1001-01) will&#xD;
      be followed for up to 260 weeks post gene therapy administration to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy parameters (~208 weeks within this study)&#xD;
