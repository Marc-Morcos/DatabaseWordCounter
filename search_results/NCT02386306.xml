  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GC021109 in subjects with mild&#xD;
      to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (as determined by 2011 National Institute on Aging-&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Association [NIA-AA] criteria and Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE]). The&#xD;
      Investigator, study site staff, (with exception of a designated pharmacist/pharmacy&#xD;
      technician) and all study subjects will be blinded to randomized study medication assignment&#xD;
      until database lock. Treatment assignments may be unblinded for select pre-authorized&#xD;
      individuals involved in the safety and PK data reviews in order to accurately determine how&#xD;
      to proceed with dose escalation.&#xD;
