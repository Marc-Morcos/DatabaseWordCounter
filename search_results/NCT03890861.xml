  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RAATE proposal is designed to determine the effects of physical activity on risk factors&#xD;
      for Alzheimer's Disease in older African American adults. The study will compare a physical&#xD;
      activity program to an active control group. There are three main objectives of the protocol:&#xD;
      1) to determine if a physical activity intervention tailored to older African American adults&#xD;
      is effective in modifying cognitive function associated with Alzheimer's Disease, 2) to&#xD;
      determine if a physical activity intervention tailored to older African American adults is&#xD;
      effective in modifying brain function and structure associated with Alzheimer's Disease, and&#xD;
      3) to determine if a physical activity promotion intervention tailored to African American&#xD;
      adults is effective at enhancing physiological parameters. The primary endpoints for the&#xD;
      study are episodic memory and executive functioning. The secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      anthropometry, blood pressure, brain activation, cerebral blood flow, volume of whole brain&#xD;
      and white matter hyperintensities, cardiorespiratory fitness, objectively measured physical&#xD;
      activity, circulating hormones, and telomere length.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is steadily increasing in prevalence, with a devastating public health&#xD;
      impact. The prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease is higher in African Americans compared to&#xD;
      white Americans, thereby constituting a health disparity. Interventions that prevent&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease or change the course of cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease are needed. Most older adults do not achieve recommended levels of physical activity,&#xD;
      and this includes African Americans. Regular physical activity has proven to be a safe and&#xD;
      effective means to enhance cognitive function in older adults ranging from cognitively&#xD;
      healthy to mildly cognitively impaired. Therefore, our study is focused on physical activity&#xD;
      promotion, a potent approach to modifying multiple neurobiological pathways implicated in&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease. We evaluate exercise benefits among elderly African Americans, who are&#xD;
      understudied and in whom the natural course of neurodegeneration, exercise effects on&#xD;
      neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, and resulting clinical phenotypes may differ. A large&#xD;
      body of existing data suggests that exercise improves cardiovascular and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      functioning, and thus has the potential to enhance perivascular clearance of amyloid and&#xD;
      reduce chronic brain tissue ischemia, among other beneficial effects. At the same time,&#xD;
      chronic exercise has been shown to decrease central levels of inflammatory markers and&#xD;
      increase central levels of neurotrophic factors, which in turn promote protection against&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease neurodegeneration pathways via a variety of mechanisms. While physical&#xD;
      activity interventions have been shown to have positive effects on these factors and on&#xD;
      resultant cognitive functioning in older adults, nearly all interventions have had a&#xD;
      negligible representation of African Americans. Prior data suggests that African Americans&#xD;
      enter their elderly years against a backdrop of different lifespan exposures to a variety of&#xD;
      factors relevant to neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, including cardiovascular risk,&#xD;
      exercise, diet, and education. In addition, prior data suggests that the key genetic risk&#xD;
      factor for Alzheimer's Disease (APOE) may have differing consequences for Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      risk among African Americans, and other genetic differences have the potential to influence&#xD;
      the brain benefits of physical activity in this community. We will utilize a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to addresses these questions. Participants will be randomized into a physical&#xD;
      activity promotion intervention or a healthy aging information group for 52 weeks. All&#xD;
      participants will be of normal cognitive function. We will assess cognitive function, brain&#xD;
      structure and function, circulating hormones, objectively measured physical activity,&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness, and telomere length. Our study will take the first step toward&#xD;
      understanding whether the hypothesized benefits of exercise for the brain carry over to&#xD;
      elderly African Americans.&#xD;

    <description>The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is a common neuropsychological tool used to evaluate episodic memory. The RAVLT involves providing participants with 15 unrelated words and asking them to recall the word list. There are 5 trials designed to determine short-term memory and then a 30 minute delay to assess long-term memory. The total words correct in both the short- and long-term trials are used as outcome measures.</description>

    <description>The NIH Toolbox Executive Function subdomain consists of the Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test and the Dimensional Change Card Sort Test. The Flanker test is a measure of one's ability to inhibit attention to irrelevant conditions. Participants must identify the direction of a central visual stimuli amongst flanking stimuli either congruent or incongruent with the central stimuli. There are 40 trials and scores range from 0 - 10. The Card Sort is a measure of the ability to shift attention based on rules. Participants must match a target visual stimuli to either a color or word stimuli and this matching shifts during the assessment.</description>

The Office of Legal and Regulatory Compliance is responsible for all data agreements which includes data subject to the protection under HIPAA. As part of the Louisiana State University System, Pennington Biomedical ensures that data agreements are in place in the following circumstances: business associate agreements when the transfer of data contains all identifiers, data use agreements when the transfer of data contains those identifiers that constitute a limited data set and a data transfer agreement in instances where data is de-identified, but still may be subject of protection in order to protect intellectual property rights. Transmission of data to ensure proper safeguards are in place on the data in motion and data at reset are carried out with assistance of the Research Computing Group or the Office of Computing Services.</ipd_description>
