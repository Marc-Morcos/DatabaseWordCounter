      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of low and high dose CPC-201 on brain&#xD;
      function including cerebral acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity measured by positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients will continue on the 10 mg/day dose of donepezil with the addition of 15 mg/day of&#xD;
      solifenacin at least for a week, donepezil will be titrated from 10 to 50 mg/day (maximum&#xD;
      allowed dose; MAD) or each patient's MTD with increments of 5 or 10 mg weekly or bi-weekly as&#xD;
      medically appropriate. When the MTD or MAD of donepezil co-administered with solifenacin 15&#xD;
      mg/day as CPC-201 has been reached, treatment will be stably maintained, as tolerated, for 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients successfully completing this protocol will have the option of continuing in an open&#xD;
      extension of their CPC-201 treatment (separate protocol) or returned to their pre-admission&#xD;
      therapeutic regimen and discharged from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the days of study drug dose increase, patients will be evaluated at a clinic as an&#xD;
      out-patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a sequential study conducted in 6 phases in AD patients who had previously been&#xD;
      receiving donepezil at a dose of 10 mg/day:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Solifenacin introduction at a dose of 15 mg/day (given with continued donepezil 10&#xD;
           mg/day as CPC-201);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Donepezil dose escalation to each subject's MTD or 50 mg/day (MAD), given in combination&#xD;
           with solifenacin 15 mg/day as CPC-201;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Donepezil maintenance at its MTD (or MAD) combined with solifenacin 15 mg/day as CPC-201&#xD;
           for 3 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Protocol exit (after resumption of pre-study treatment regimen and successful completion&#xD;
           of a one month post-study safety check) or optional entry into a 6 month extension&#xD;
           phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment (during solifenacin introduction): Upon successful completion of a&#xD;
      screening evaluation and entry into this study, participants will continue to receive 10 mg&#xD;
      donepezil and receive neuropsychological evaluations at the clinic together with a 11C-PMP&#xD;
      PET scan and associated MRI studies of the brain in accordance with the University of&#xD;
      Michigan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solifenacin introduction: After the one week baseline assessment period, solifenacin&#xD;
      treatment will be initiated at 15 mg/day for at least one week while patients continue to&#xD;
      receive donepezil at a dose of 10 mg/day. Those who do not tolerate solifenacin will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study and replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donepezil escalation: During this phase, while continuing to receive 15 mg/day of&#xD;
      solifenacin, the dose of donepezil will be gradually increased at weekly or bi-weekly with&#xD;
      increments of 5 or 10 mg as tolerated. The dose of donepezil will be increased until the&#xD;
      first intolerable dose (FID) is reached or a dose of 50 mg/day is attained, whichever comes&#xD;
      first. Once patients reach their FID, their MTD will be defined as their immediately&#xD;
      preceding, tolerated dose. During dose titration, investigators may extend the same donepezil&#xD;
      dose for additional days or temporarily (or permanently) reduce it as medically indicated. On&#xD;
      the days of donepezil dose increase, patients will remain in the clinic for at least 5 hours&#xD;
      after study drug administration or until signs and symptoms of medically significant adverse&#xD;
      effects abate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donepezil dose maintenance: During this phase, patients will continue treatment with&#xD;
      donepezil (at MTD) and solifenacin (15 mg/day) for 3 months (± 2 weeks). All will be followed&#xD;
      by weekly telephone interviews and monthly clinic visits to assess safety and tolerability.&#xD;
      If intolerable adverse events (AEs) develop, the daily dose of donepezil will be&#xD;
      down-titrated, and the patient will continue treatment on their new MTD for an additional 2&#xD;
      weeks or up to completion of the maintenance phase, whichever comes last. Patients who&#xD;
      continue to experience intolerable AEs after several down-titrations will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study testing at the end of donepezil dose maintenance: After completion of 3-months&#xD;
      (± 2 weeks) treatment with donepezil (at MTD) and solifenacin (15 mg/day), study participants&#xD;
      will receive a repeat of their clinical examination, routine laboratory safety tests and PET&#xD;
      associated studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients successfully completing this protocol will then have the option of continuing in an&#xD;
      open extension of their CPC-201 treatment (separate protocol) or to be returned to their&#xD;
      pre-admission therapeutic regimen and discharged from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Exit: Upon termination of this study, subjects will return to their original daily&#xD;
      donepezil dose. Investigator will decide whether the patient should discontinue high dose of&#xD;
      donepezil without down-titration, or whether donepezil should be down-titrated to their&#xD;
      prestudy donepezil dose. Whatever the decision, the patient will ordinarily be treated at&#xD;
      least an additional 7 days with solifenacin 15 mg/day.&#xD;
