  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is a medical illness that damages the brain and causes problems with&#xD;
      memory, mood and behavior. A substance called acetylcholine (ACh), which is naturally&#xD;
      produced in the body, plays an important role in the normal functioning of the brain. In&#xD;
      subjects with Alzheimer's disease, the level of ACh is greatly reduced. Currently, there are&#xD;
      three commonly prescribed drugs used for treating the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease by&#xD;
      helping to maintain the level of ACh in the brain. This study will evaluate how much each of&#xD;
      these drugs changes the levels of certain brain chemicals that are known to, or may play an&#xD;
      important role in, Alzheimer's disease and its symptoms.&#xD;
