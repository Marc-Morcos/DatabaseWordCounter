      This study will investigate the neurobiological effect of tacrolimus in persons with MCI and&#xD;
      dementia due to AD by measuring biomarkers of target engagement in immune response,&#xD;
      amyloid-b, tau and neurodegeneration in CSF, functional connectivity with MRI and EEG, and&#xD;
      cognition. Study objectives include:&#xD;
