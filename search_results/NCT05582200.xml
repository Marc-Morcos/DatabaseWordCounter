  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation occurs in many brain diseases including Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, amyloid starts accumulating decades before the start of forgetfulness. Basic&#xD;
      scientists have reported that inflammation but not amyloid is linked to forgetfulness. When&#xD;
      people pinch a finger, it gets swollen. Similar changes occur in brain from various causes.&#xD;
      New medications are under development to help healing and prevent permanent damages in the&#xD;
      brain. When people pinch a finger, they can check if the injury is healing or getting worse&#xD;
      by watching. Investigators can watch inside of the brain using a special camera called&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET). It is currently possible to watch inflammation in the&#xD;
      brain by taking pictures of a molecule called translocator protein (TSPO). But the problem is&#xD;
      that by imaging TSPO, investigators can catch changes in more than one kind of cells. The&#xD;
      information is not specific to each cell type. Such vague information is not useful to&#xD;
      monitor the effect of new medications for inflammation. This proposal attempts to develop a&#xD;
      novel method to capture changes in each of two major players in inflammation, microglia and&#xD;
      astrocytes. To do so, investigators will take selective pictures of one cell type by using a&#xD;
      novel imaging agent for PET. Investigators will also take PET pictures of TSPO. Investigators&#xD;
      will process these two kinds of PET pictures using advanced mathematical methods and extract&#xD;
      specific information on microglia and astrocytes. Our novel method will be useful to monitor&#xD;
      new therapies to treat inflammation in brain.&#xD;

      Inflammation in brain plays critical roles in disease progress and symptom development in a&#xD;
      number of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), traumatic brain injury, major&#xD;
      depressive disorder, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. Neuroinflammation has been imaged using&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) by using translocator protein (TSPO) as the marker.&#xD;
      Although TSPO PET studies have provided insight to understand the pathology, some results are&#xD;
      difficult to interpret. TSPO imaging has a major limitation of not being selective to one&#xD;
      type of glia; it is expressed by both microglia and astrocyte. The current study attempts to&#xD;
      overcome this limitation. Monoamine oxidase type-B (MAO-B) is highly expressed by astrocyte&#xD;
      and serotonin (5-HT)-releasing neurons but not by microglia. PET studies using a prototype&#xD;
      tracer 11C-L-deprenyl detects astrogliosis in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) but this tracer&#xD;
      has low levels of specific binding. Preliminary results show that a novel tracer 18F-SMBT-1&#xD;
      developed by Dr. Okamura and his colleagues has several times greater levels of specific&#xD;
      binding. The Aims of the current study are to 1) estimate radiation-absorbed doses in 8&#xD;
      healthy people, 2) measure ratios of specific-to-nondisplaceable binding by performing brain&#xD;
      scans with and without binding blockade in 5 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 3) measure&#xD;
      reproducibility of measuring 18F-SMBT-1 in 8 healthy people, 4) compare MAO-B levels between&#xD;
      healthy controls (n = 25) and patients with AD (n = 25), and 5) from 11C-ER176 for TSPO and&#xD;
      18F-SMBT-1, extract cell type specific information for microglia and astrocytes and&#xD;
      investigate changes in each cell type In AD.&#xD;
