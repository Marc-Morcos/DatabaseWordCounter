      This clinical trial evaluates the impact of music interventions on caregivers of patients&#xD;
      with memory disorders, Alzheimer's disease, dementia and related disorders. This study will&#xD;
      follow caregivers of patients within the rehabilitation day care hospital &quot;Memory and&#xD;
      Frailty&quot; (Hôpital de Jour de Réadaptation Mémoire et Fragilités), Sainte-Marie Paris&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;

      This clinical trial evaluates the impact of music on caregivers of patients with memory&#xD;
      disorders, Alzheimer's disease, dementia and related disorders. This study will follow&#xD;
      caregivers of patients within the rehabilitation day hospital &quot;Memory and Frailty &quot; (Hôpital&#xD;
      de Jour de Réadaptation Mémoire et Fragilités), Sainte-Marie Paris Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will benefit from a first session of a relaxation-type musical technique in&#xD;
      the Day care Hospital (HDJ), they will then follow the sessions in their own homes. During&#xD;
      the first visit, all participants will complete self-assessments, including a questionnaire&#xD;
      on musical preferences and a self-assessment anxiety scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected inclusion period is 30 days. Carers will be equipped with tablets, headphones,&#xD;
      eye masks and workbooks/questionnaires to use every day for one month in their homes. A&#xD;
      relaxation-type receptive musical technique is used. The standardized 20-minute musical&#xD;
      sequence is broken down into several phases that gradually lead the patient to a state of&#xD;
      relaxation using the new U technique. The effect works by reducing the musical rhythm,&#xD;
      orchestral formation, frequencies and volume (the &quot;U&quot; descending phase). After a maximum&#xD;
      relaxation phase (lower part of the &quot;U&quot;), a re-activating phase (ascending branch of the &quot;U&quot;)&#xD;
      follows. All the musical sequences, built with the U-shape editing method, were specially&#xD;
      produced by the music publishing company Music Care©. During the first session in HDJ, the&#xD;
      subjects will lie on a relaxation table with a raised headrest (extended or semi-seated&#xD;
      listening position) in an enclosed space, calm, secure and comfortable, with minimum&#xD;
      lighting, so that the participant feels comfortable. The music will be played on headphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to reduce anxiety among carers who accompany patients with memory&#xD;
      disorders, Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.&#xD;

    <description>Long-term anxiety will be measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scale. The STAI is a psychological inventory based on a 4-point Likert scale and consists of 40 questions on a self-report basis. The STAI measures two types of anxiety - state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and trait anxiety, or anxiety level as a personal characteristic. Scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores correlating with greater anxiety.</description>
