  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is the most common disease responsible for dementia, accounting for&#xD;
      40-70% of all dementia cases. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a gradual and slow&#xD;
      decline in memory and other cognitive functions and activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medications currently used in Alzheimer's disease were introduced in the 1990s and&#xD;
      exhibit insufficient effectiveness. Despite their use, the disease rapidly progresses,&#xD;
      leading to complete loss of independence and death. There are conducted numerous studies on&#xD;
      new molecules, however none of them has been successfully accomplished so far. Transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) is one of the youngest electrophysiological methods, enabling&#xD;
      non-invasive and painless stimulation of the central and peripheral nervous system. Another&#xD;
      non-invasible neurophysiological method that is utilized in treating patients with&#xD;
      neurological dysfunctions and mental disorders is Transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS). Clinical trials conducted with isolated usage of rTMS and tDCS showed a positive&#xD;
      effect of these methods on the enhancement of cognitive functions in patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the combination of&#xD;
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Resonance (rTMS) with Transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation in the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. The primary goal of the project is to&#xD;
      assess whether the use of combined tDCS and rTMS therapies in patients diagnosed with mild to&#xD;
      moderate Alzheimer's disease improves patients' cognitive functions, including memory,&#xD;
      attention, thinking, executive and language functions. The research hypothesis assumes that&#xD;
      the combination of rTMS and tDCS therapy is an effective method of Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      therapy that can improve cognitive functions and functioning of patients, both in the short&#xD;
      and long term.&#xD;
