  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the present work is to establish a firm knowledge base regarding&#xD;
      depression and anxiety as risk factors for dementia and how social relationships impact this&#xD;
      association. This risk factors, and efforts to reduce them are described through a follow up&#xD;
      over three decades.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Health Study in Nord-Trondelag (HUNT) fulfils most of the key requirements of a&#xD;
      population-representative cohort study by meeting the following elements: firm knowledge&#xD;
      about the population denominator, knowledge about reasons for refusal (in line with previous&#xD;
      methods in HUNT), options for levels and localisation of participation (at test station, at&#xD;
      home, at nursing homes), coverage of sociodemographic features by the comprehensive&#xD;
      HUNT4-protocol and register linkage, inclusion of institutionalized individuals and&#xD;
      individuals with reduced capacity to consent, measurement of risk and compensatory factors&#xD;
      across the life course by merging with previous results in HUNT surveys and linkage to&#xD;
      registries, core elements and assessment methods can be compared with other European&#xD;
      populations studies including elderly people, and finally, the ability to include biobank&#xD;
      results in the data analysis. The HUNT data supplemented by register linkage include all&#xD;
      established and suspected risk factors of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A particular focus on primary health care is appropriate because it is in this part of the&#xD;
      health care system that the need for extra resources due to the substantial increase in&#xD;
      dementia prevalence is most pronounced. Furthermore, preventive measures in a life-course&#xD;
      perspective will mainly have to be implemented in the primary health care setting.&#xD;
