      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of transcutaneous vagus nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (tVNS) on specific brain regions involved in memory and attention processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tVNS is a non-invasive and non-pharmacological technique known for targeting the locus&#xD;
      coeruleus, a small subcortical nucleus in the brain thought to be involved in the earliest&#xD;
      stages of Alzheimer's disease. This nucleus also plays a role in numerous cognitive&#xD;
      functions, comprising memory and attention.&#xD;

      This study is an observational MRI study with a pseudo-randomized single blind cross-over&#xD;
      design. The population consists of 30 healthy human volunteers from 60 to 80 years old. These&#xD;
      healthy older individuals will be recruited from the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed about the study protocol and the potential risks, subjects will be given&#xD;
      1 week to consider their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants giving written informed consent will be included in the study. The first&#xD;
      session will consist in neuropsychological assessments and a task practice session in the&#xD;
      dummy scanner in order to get familiar with the environment. Participants meeting the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be included for the next sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second and third sessions are MRI scanning sessions including transcutaneous vagus nerve&#xD;
      stimulation. Both the placebo and experimental stimulation conditions will be randomized in a&#xD;
      single-blind manner across scanning sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 7 to 10 weeks after each scanning session and at least 4 days previous to the next MRI&#xD;
      session, participant will be asked to fill in an online memory test for assessing potential&#xD;
      outlasting effects of the stimulation technique.&#xD;
