  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human clinical trial to test whether a protein administered into the brain&#xD;
      continuously by gene therapy, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), will slow or prevent&#xD;
      cell loss in the brains of people affected by Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment. The protein may also activate cells in the brain that have not yet deteriorated.&#xD;
      Gene therapy refers to the use of a harmless virus to have brain cells make the potentially&#xD;
      protective protein, BDNF.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open label Phase I clinical trial of AAV2-BDNF gene therapy for early Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in 12 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BDNF is a nervous system growth factor that regulates neuronal function in key memory&#xD;
      circuits of the brain (the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus). BDNF reduces cell loss,&#xD;
      stimulates cell function, and builds new connections (synapses) between brain cells in animal&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will use techniques of gene therapy because the candidate therapeutic&#xD;
      protein, BDNF, does not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Two previous clinical programs&#xD;
      of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) gene therapy for AD and Neurturin gene therapy for Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease in over 120 patients provided evidence that degenerating neurons respond to growth&#xD;
      factors with classic &quot;trophic&quot; responses in the human brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo one gene transfer procedure. Thus, dosing is performed only once,&#xD;
      and repeat dosing or daily medications are not expected to be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 participants will be enrolled in this Phase I trial, 6 with early AD and 6 with MCI.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study aims to reduce neuronal loss and rebuild synapses in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). A total of 12 subjects will be enrolled: subjects 1-6 will have a diagnosis of AD and subjects 7-12 will have a diagnosis of MCI. The gene therapy vector will consist of adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) and will be stereotaxically administered into the brain under MRI guidance. Subjects will be followed over a pre-determined study time duration of 24 months, and indefinitely thereafter.</intervention_model_description>
