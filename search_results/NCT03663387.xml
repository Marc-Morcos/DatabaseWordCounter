  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clearance. CSF cushions the&#xD;
      brain from impact and carries waste products from the brain to the bloodstream. This process&#xD;
      is known as clearance. Researchers have considered that impaired clearance of amyloid (a&#xD;
      protein) from the aging brain causes buildup of amyloid in the brain and plays a role in&#xD;
      increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. However, until recently, there has not been a method&#xD;
      to measure CSF clearance. This study will examine CSF clearance using positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) scanning, which creates images of structures in the body and their&#xD;
      functioning. This study will also measure the amount of two proteins, tau and amyloid, in the&#xD;
      brain. Tau and amyloid are proteins that build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. An investigational compound (tracer) called [18F]MK-6240 is injected into the blood&#xD;
      prior to the scan in order to take images of the CSF clearance and measure tau protein in the&#xD;
      brain. This tracer is considered investigational because it is not approved by the US Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use and is only being used for research purposes.&#xD;

      The impaired clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) leading to the accumulation of Aβ plaques and&#xD;
      consequent neurodegeneration, is a partially understood mechanistic hypothesis for late onset&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and a tracer for tau&#xD;
      lesions, with a low molecular weight that rapidly enters and clears the brain, the&#xD;
      investigators developed, replicated, and validated a non-invasive method to estimate the&#xD;
      clearance of CSF at ventricular and brain levels. The investigators propose to complete over&#xD;
      five years, a 2y longitudinal study designed to test in preclinical AD the hypothesis that&#xD;
      reduced CSF clearance measured with the tau tracer [18F]-MK6240 is predictive of: a) future&#xD;
      amyloid lesions (PiB-PET or Florbetaben-PET); b) brain atrophy (MRI); and c) cognitive&#xD;
      decline.&#xD;

        This study will involve male and female volunteer subjects from any racial or ethnic group&#xD;
        with a diagnosis normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. The proposed sample is not&#xD;
        intended to be representative of a general population, but it will approximate the samples&#xD;
        recruited in NIH and industry sponsored FDA approved clinical trials targeting secondary AD&#xD;
        prevention. At this stage of knowledge of human brain CSF clearance, a population based&#xD;
        approach was considered premature and over cap funding to support a larger study was not&#xD;
        permitted for RFA AG-17-055. Rather, our design uses Aβ enrichment to enable an efficient&#xD;
        test of the CSF clearance hypothesis in a clinically relevant group.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects between 20-100 years old will be enrolled. Younger subjects&#xD;
             are not included as the risk for brain amyloid lesions is too low&#xD;

             English.&#xD;
