  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that quetiapine will improve sleep in persons with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease (AD), with higher doses producing greater total sleep time and sleep efficiency.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quetiapine is frequently used to treat psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD)&#xD;
      and other dementias. These patients commonly have sleep disturbances that include nighttime&#xD;
      awakenings with confused, agitated behaviors. These awakenings impose a great challenge for&#xD;
      caregivers, especially family caregivers whose own sleep is disrupted as a result of the&#xD;
      patient's awakenings. Sleep disturbance can lead to nursing home placement3 and may add to&#xD;
      cognitive impairment of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no medication proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of sleep disorders in&#xD;
      patients with dementia. Antipsychotic medications are often prescribed at bedtime in the&#xD;
      hopes that they will aid sleep and reduce agitation and psychosis associated with these&#xD;
      awakenings. Sleep disturbance is more common in AD patients with moderate to severe disease,&#xD;
      and these patients are more likely to have psychosis and to be recruited from long-term care&#xD;
      facilities. We recently conducted the only multicenter clinical trial of a drug for sleep&#xD;
      disturbance in AD. The study, completed under the auspices of the NIA's Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      Cooperative Study, investigated melatonin as a sedative-hypnotic agent for AD patients. We&#xD;
      found melatonin to be of no benefit on objective measures, although there were positive&#xD;
      trends in the data and a significant improvement on subjective measures (caregiver ratings of&#xD;
      patients' sleep) in one of the melatonin groups relative to placebo. No other large trial in&#xD;
      AD subjects has been reported in the literature for drugs with potential benefit for AD&#xD;
      patients with sleep disturbances. There are several reasons why this population needs to be&#xD;
      specifically studied. Patients with AD tend to have highly fragmented sleep, with many&#xD;
      nocturnal awakenings. They have significant daytime sleepiness that might affect daytime&#xD;
      cognitive function and behavior. These patients tend to be older, with sensitivity to drug&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with neurodegenerative diseases such as AD may respond differently to CNS-active&#xD;
      medications. Finally, this population represents a large and growing cohort of patients that&#xD;
      deserve individual study of their unique problems.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 55-90 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of possible or probable AD as defined by NINCDS-ADRD criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Sleep disturbance defined by mean score of 3 on first six items of the SDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Family member able to provide surrogate informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Live-in caregiver able to monitor medication and serve as informant on questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Caregiver who is fluent in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Be able to ingest oral tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Be able to avoid caffeinated and alcoholic beverages during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A neuroimaging study at the time of initial diagnosis, or any time since that is&#xD;
             consistent with AD and effectively rules out dementia related only to stroke,&#xD;
             hydrocephalus or other neurological condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Medical disorders that may account for sleep disturbance, especially delirium, Major&#xD;
             Depressive Disorder (DSMIV) and severe or significant acute or chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have acute or unstable medical conditions including renal failure, abnormal liver&#xD;
             function, cardiac arrhythmia, sitting blood pressure below 110/70 or above 140/100 or&#xD;
             postural blood drop 20 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Symptoms suggesting other sleep disorders (e.g., periodic limb movement disorder,&#xD;
             restless legs syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome), may be present but in the&#xD;
             opinion of the PI, do not account for the primary symptoms of insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Sleep disturbance symptoms that suggest a parasomnia. Parasomnias may include&#xD;
             behavioral manifestations of epileptiform activity or REM Behavior Disorder (RBD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous treatment failure with quetiapine of AD-associated sleep disturbances, or&#xD;
             intolerance of quetiapine in a previous treatment trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Concomitant treatment with another antipsychotic or sedative-hypnotic medication,&#xD;
             including trazodone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Evidence of a major mental disorder other than dementia, such as major depression or&#xD;
             schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Stable doses (for 4 weeks prior to study entry) of antidepressant, antiepileptic mood&#xD;
             stabilizer, or acetylcholinesterase inhibitor medication will be allowed, but&#xD;
             initiation or recent changes in the dose of such medications will be prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Benzodiazepines within 2 weeks of study entry will not be allowed.&#xD;
