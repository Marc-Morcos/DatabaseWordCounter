      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of 2 fixed doses of EVP-6124&#xD;
      hydrochloride (HCl) compared to placebo for 24 weeks in subjects with mild to moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease who are concurrently receiving stable treatment with memantine and&#xD;
      currently receiving stable treatment or previously treated with an acetylcholinesterase&#xD;
