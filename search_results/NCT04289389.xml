      To investigate and make valid estimates of the occurrence of dementia and the most common&#xD;
      subtypes of dementia in Trøndelag, and transfer these figures to estimates of the occurrence&#xD;
      of dementia in Norway as a whole, by age, sex and severity of dementia. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      proportion of people without dementia diagnosis among those with dementia will be examined.&#xD;
      The investigators will further investigate whether there are differences in dementia&#xD;
      prevalence between males and females and educational groups and look at factors associated&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction There are currently no valid estimates of the occurrence of dementia in Norway.&#xD;
      Estimates in use range from 70.000 to 104.000, with the highest estimate being 50 percent&#xD;
      greater than the lowest. This makes it difficult to plan today's health services and estimate&#xD;
      future needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enable good planning of services to people with dementia, it is important that people with&#xD;
      dementia to be evaluated and diagnosed for their illness. An early diagnosis seems to improve&#xD;
      prognosis for the course of the disease. The proportion of undiagnosed people with dementia&#xD;
      differs in the studies done on this and it is unclear which factors that may explain why many&#xD;
      remain undiagnosed for their dementia disease. As a quality measure on the cognitive data&#xD;
      being collected in this study we will make population-based Norwegian norms for the Montreal&#xD;
      Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA) test and the Ten-word delayed recall test from CERAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to provide knowledge that is crucial for planning good health and&#xD;
      care services for older people with cognitive impairment and dementia. We will make valid&#xD;
      estimates for the prevalence of dementia and the most common subtypes of them in Trøndelag&#xD;
      and transfer these figures to estimates to Norway as a whole, by age, gender and severity of&#xD;
      disease. We will investigate whether there are differences in dementia prevalence between&#xD;
      males and females and educational groups. Furthermore, there will be made a survey of the&#xD;
      proportion of people without dementia diagnosis among those with dementia, and examine the&#xD;
      factors associated with a lack of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The data collection was a collaboration with the Health Survey in Nord-Trøndelag when&#xD;
      this was carried out for the fourth time (HUNT4) in the period 2017-2019. All persons over&#xD;
      the age of 70 living in 23 municipalities in Nord-Trøndelag and a district in Trondheim&#xD;
      municipality (Trøndelag) were invited to an assessment at a field stations or by home visits&#xD;
      (including institutionalized care), in the study parts called HUNT4 70+ and HUNT4 Trondheim&#xD;
      70+. The participants were offered a survey of cognition and function in everyday life. To&#xD;
      get more information on cognitive function an interview with next of kin were made for&#xD;
      participants with possible cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnostic work-up group of scientific and clinical experts (geriatrics, old age psychiatry&#xD;
      or neurology) assessed the cases and made the research-based diagnosis. Standard diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria according to the DSM-5 was applied for all the dementia diseases. The new estimates&#xD;
      from Trøndelag will be used to estimate the occurrence of dementia in Norway as a whole, by&#xD;
      age, sex and severity of dementia. Furthermore, the proportion of people without dementia&#xD;
      diagnosis among those with dementia will be examined. Information about known dementia&#xD;
      diagnosis from dementia assessment in municipality or specialist health service will be&#xD;
      obtained by linking to registered data. The investigators will further investigate whether&#xD;
      there are differences in dementia prevalence between males and females and educational groups&#xD;
      and look at factors associated with a lack of diagnosis. Information from the earlier waves&#xD;
      of HUNT (1-4) will be used to get information on health and risk factors for dementia from&#xD;
      the study population.&#xD;
