  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether daily treatment with this new treatment&#xD;
      approach, called COT would be effective in protecting the memory and brain regions of people&#xD;
      who are already showing signs of memory loss.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease process starts in parts of the brain used for perceiving and interpreting&#xD;
      smell many years before people begin to lose their memory and other cognitive functions.&#xD;
      These parts of the brain are called the &quot;olfactory regions.&quot; From these olfactory regions,&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease spread to involve other parts of the brain. Scientists have shown that&#xD;
      stimulating the olfactory regions through exposure to multiple naturally occurring essential&#xD;
      or plant oils help to reduce the brain changes of Alzheimer's disease in animals. Also, many&#xD;
      components from these plant oils have been shown to protect nerve cells from various kinds of&#xD;
      stress and injuries; and we say they are 'neuroprotective'. A novel home-based olfactory&#xD;
      chemosensory stimulation program that uses a portable, programmed, device known as the&#xD;
      Computerized Olfactory Training (COT) program, administers olfactory psychophysical tasks&#xD;
      while patients are being stimulated repeatedly with neuroprotective olfactory stimulants,&#xD;
      using neuroscience-guided stimulation parameters to ensure sustained activation of all&#xD;
      primary and secondary olfactory structures.&#xD;

Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) PACC (ADAS-PACC) is a composite score of: The Total Recall score from the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) (range from 0-48 points), The Delayed Recall score on the Logical Memory IIa subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale (range from 0-25 points), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test score from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (range from 0-93 points), and the MMSE score (range from 0-30 points). Each of the component change scores is divided by the baseline sample standard deviation of that component, to form standardized z scores. These z scores are summed to form the composite. Z Scores could range from -5 to +5 with higher scores indicating less deficit and lower scores indicating greater deficit.</description>
