  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will test an intervention for an understudied population -&#xD;
      family caregivers of persons living with dementia (PLWD). This project is the first of its&#xD;
      kind to longitudinally follow family caregivers of PLWD into bereavement. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      intervention, Caregiver Speaks, employs an innovative storytelling approach - photo&#xD;
      elicitation (the use of photos to elicit thoughts, feelings, and reactions to a person's&#xD;
      experience) - to encourage family caregivers to make meaning of their caregiving and&#xD;
      bereavement experiences as a way of reducing depression, anxiety, and ultimately grief&#xD;
      intensity. Caregiver Speaks is deployed via a readily available social media network&#xD;
      (Facebook), which allows easy access for already overburdened family caregivers of PLWD, and&#xD;
      can improve their social support. Preliminary work demonstrates that 1) this project is&#xD;
      feasible as an RCT intervention study of caregiver experiences, 2) the research team can&#xD;
      conduct this type of storytelling intervention via Facebook, and 3) family caregivers use&#xD;
      (and want to use) social media during active caregiving and into bereavement, despite their&#xD;
      heavy care burdens. The research team will base the proposal on Park and Folkman's&#xD;
      meaning-making model of stress and coping. This model illustrates how individuals cope with&#xD;
      adverse life events (i.e., trauma, or death of a loved one) by reconstructing and&#xD;
      transforming the event's meaning and incorporating the reappraised meaning into one's larger&#xD;
      self-narrative. Caregiver Speaks uses storytelling in the form of photo-elicitation, in order&#xD;
      to facilitate this meaning-making. Caregivers share photos and discussions regarding their&#xD;
      caregiving and bereavement experiences in a private, facilitated Facebook group. This model&#xD;
      suggests that caregivers' ability to make sense of (meaning making), and find benefit in an&#xD;
      adverse life situation (caregiving and bereavement) will be validated through social support,&#xD;
      and result in reduced depression, anxiety, and grief intensity. Caregivers will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either: 1) Group 1, which will receive the Caregiver Speaks intervention, or 2)&#xD;
      Group 2, which will receive standard care, including the standard care for bereavement. The&#xD;
      research team will use both quantitative and qualitative methods in parallel and equal status&#xD;
      to measure the intervention's efficacy. The overall hypothesis is that participating in&#xD;
      Caregiver Speaks during caregiving and into bereavement will reduce caregivers' depression&#xD;
      and anxiety, and as a result will reduce grief intensity in bereavement. The three specific&#xD;
      aims are to: 1) determine the efficacy of the Caregiver Speaks intervention in reducing&#xD;
      depression and anxiety among family caregivers of people with dementia, 2) examine the&#xD;
      intervention's effect on grief intensity among bereaved family caregivers of people with&#xD;
      dementia, and 3) describe how caregivers made meaning of their caregiving and bereavement&#xD;
      experiences.&#xD;
