  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that reappraising intergeneration relationships through perspective-taking&#xD;
      will enhance the well-being of adult-child caregivers. Incorporating both psychological and&#xD;
      social perspectives, the study makes a unique contribution to address research gaps by&#xD;
      evaluating an integrated model of intervention for dementia caregivers. The conceptual model&#xD;
      involves the following components: 1) relational insights; 2) self-reflection to integrate&#xD;
      the challenges and benefits in caregiving; 3) interpersonal empathy&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the incremental value of perspective-taking reappraisals, the study involves a&#xD;
      two-arm randomized controlled trial of 12 weeks of intervention with two conditions: 1)&#xD;
      Reappraisal through Perspective Taking and 2) Basic Skill Building. Telephone-administered&#xD;
      sessions are integrated with group sessions and home visits to maximize sustainability and&#xD;
      accessibility of the intervention. One hundred fifty-four participants will be recruited and&#xD;
      randomized. Primary outcomes are reduced depressive symptoms and enhanced psychological&#xD;
      well-being for the caregivers. Secondary outcomes include enhanced social support for&#xD;
      caregivers and reduced behavioral problems in the care-recipients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to address a major research gap in caregiving interventions in the&#xD;
      context of intergeneration perspective-taking reappraisals. Adult child caregivers are part&#xD;
      of a sandwich generation, involved in actualizing their own goals and coping with social&#xD;
      expectations to care for their elderly parents. Dementia caregiving presents a particular&#xD;
      challenge in life transition wherein the adult child is parenting his or her parents. With&#xD;
      global aging, people living with dementia are rising exponentially. This presents a challenge&#xD;
      for sustainable care in Hong Kong and also in countries where public services are developing&#xD;
      and the demand for family and intergeneration caregiving is high due to collectivistic&#xD;
      concerns. It is hypothesized that reappraising intergeneration relationships through&#xD;
      perspective-taking will enhance the well-being of adult-child caregivers. Incorporating both&#xD;
      psychological and social perspectives, the study makes a unique contribution to address&#xD;
      research gaps by evaluating an integrated model of intervention for dementia caregivers. The&#xD;
      conceptual model involves the following components: 1) relational insights; 2)&#xD;
      self-reflection to integrate the challenges and benefits in caregiving; 3) interpersonal&#xD;
      empathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most caregiving psycho-education programs involve skill training including scheduling&#xD;
      pleasant events, communicating with the care recipient and other family members. To test the&#xD;
      incremental value of perspective-taking reappraisals, the study involves a two-arm randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of 12 weeks of intervention with two conditions: 1) Perspective Taking&#xD;
      Reappraisal and 2) Basic Skill Building. Telephone-administered sessions are integrated with&#xD;
      home visits to maximize sustainability and accessibility of the intervention. One hundred&#xD;
      fifty-four participants will be recruited and randomized. Primary outcomes are reduced&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and enhanced psychological well-being for the caregivers. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include enhanced social support for caregivers and reduced behavioral problems in&#xD;
      the care-recipients. Measures are obtained at baseline Weeks 1 (baseline), 6 and 12 with a&#xD;
      follow-up at Week 24. Findings have implications for enhancing sustainable care for older&#xD;
      adults in the wider society.&#xD;

    <description>20-item measure that asks caregivers to rate how often over the past week they The scale rates experienced symptoms associated with depression.. Response options range from 0 to 3 for each item (0 = Rarely or None of the Time, 1 = Some or Little of the Time, 2 = Moderately or Much of the time, 3 = Most or Almost All the Time). Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater level of having depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 1,6, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The 18-version of the scale taps the six areas of psychological well-being: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. Respondents rate statements on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 indicating strong disagreement and 6 indicating strong agreement. The range of scores is from 0 to 108. Higher scores suggest higher levels of well-being. The subscale score of each of the six areas can be calculating by summation of the three items associated with each of the area.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 6, 12 ,24</time_frame>
    <description>The checklist is a 24-item caregiver-report measure provides a total score plus scores for three subscale memory-related problems, affective distress and disruptive behaviors. Scores are computed for the presence or absence of each problem first, and then for caregiver &quot;reaction&quot; or the extent to which caregivers were &quot;bothered&quot; or &quot;distressed&quot; by each behavior. The caregivers' reaction to each behavior, or the extent of distress experienced, were scored as follows: Reactions are assessed by asking how &quot;upsetting&quot; the behavior was on a Likert scale of 0 to 4 (0 = Not at all, 1= a little, 2 = moderately, 3 = very much, and 4 =extremely). Frequency of behaviors are assessed based on a Likert-scale of 0 to 4 (0 = never occurs, 1 = occurs infrequently and not in the last week, 2 = occurred 1-2 times in the last week, 3 = occurred 3-6 times in the last week, and 4 = occurs daily or more often). The range of score is from 0 to 96, higher scores suggesting greater disruption.</description>

    <description>The measure the levels of emotional and instrumental social support experienced by the caregivers. The scale consists of 12 items assesses the frequency of receipt of 3 categories of social support: emotional support, instrumental support and negative interaction involving conflict or excessive demands. The participants scored each item on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (frequently). The range of scores is from 0 to 48, with higher score indicating better social support.</description>
