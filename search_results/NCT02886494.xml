  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled and parallel trial&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BAC in patients with Alzheimer's disease or vascular&#xD;
      dementia. The investigation product, BAC, is a potential anti-inflammatory agent consisted of&#xD;
      Multi-Glycan Complex (MGC) from the Soybean extract. It aims to reduce the neruoinflammation&#xD;
      in the Alzhemimer's disease and vascular dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each study site, eligible patients were randomized and stratified to 1 of 2 dementia types&#xD;
      (Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's disease) in 3:1 ratio to receive either one of&#xD;
      topical application of BAC or BAC matched vehicle, topical application on external nasal&#xD;
      skin, scalp, and neck, 2 times daily, 30 g/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment duration for each patient was 12 weeks, which consisted of 6 visits located at&#xD;
      Screening (within 2 weeks before Baseline visit), Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 2, 4, 8, and Week&#xD;
      12 (Final). During the treatment period, patients may continue to receive medications or&#xD;
      treatments routinely used for Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia except those&#xD;
      prohibited under this protocol.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change-Plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus) Score at All Post Treatment Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>This is a global measure of detectable change in cognition, function and behavior. The format for CIBIS/CIBIC-Plus consists of the assessment of an independent clinician based on observation of the patient at an interview, and information provided by the caregiver. The clinician's assessing severity at baseline and overall impression for assessing severity of the global change in disease severity, compared with baseline, is rated. The CIBIS/CIBIC plus examined general, cognitive, and behavioral function and activities of daily living on a 7-point categorical rating scale, ranging from a score of 0 indicating &quot;Not assessed&quot;, to a score of 7 indicating &quot;Among the most extremely ill patients&quot; for CIBIS and ranging from 1 indicating &quot;Very much improved&quot;, to a score of 7 indicating &quot;Marked worsening&quot;, and with a score of 4 indicating &quot;no change&quot; for CIBIC-Plus. CIBIS was measured at Randomization visit and CIBIC-Plus was measured at Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.</description>

    <measure>Change in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Score at All Post Treatment Visits Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>An inventory of informant based items to assess activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, i.e. functional performance, of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It consists of 23-item inventory of ADL, rated based on extent of assistance the patient requires (independently, with supervision, with physical help): 0 (total independence in performing an activity) to 4 (total inability to act independently). Each question varies in the number of options to choose. Total score range: 0 to 78; higher scores indicate less functional impairment. ADL will be measured at Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score at All Post Treatment Visits Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>This is a multi-item instrument that examines orientation, registration, attention, calculation, recall, visuospatial abilities and language. The score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. MMSE was measured at Screening, Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.</description>

    <measure>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score at All Post Treatment Visits Compared to Baseline: NPI-10 Frequency Ã— Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI is the behavior instrument most widely used in clinical trials of anti-dementia agents. The NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time, examining and scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses to screening questions. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined. Information for the NPI is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the patient's behavior. The NPI assesses 10 behavioral domains (10-item NPI, section A~J) common in dementia. Each NPI domain is scored by the caregiver based on a standardized interview administered by the clinician. Frequency is scored from 1 (occasionally) to 4 (very frequently) and severity is rated from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe). The score for each domain is frequency multiplied by severity. Therefore, the score ranges from 1 to 12 with higher scores indicate worse condition. NPI was measured at Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>AEs were reported through the study completion (up to 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a study medication and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study medication, whether or not related to the study medication. Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs unless determined to be clinically significant by the Investigator. The number of participants with adverse events within the BAC and placebo groups was determined.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Recruitment was conducted in the United States. The study was open for recruitment in December 2016 and the first participant was successfully enrolled in January 2017.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The planned sample size was determined to be 45 versus 15 patients (3:1 ratio) for BAC treatment versus vehicle groups, 60 evaluable patients in total. To ensure the completion of 60 evaluable patients, around 75 patients were planned to be recruited. Actually, in this study, 80 eligible subjects were recruited and 59 evaluable subjects were achieved.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale- Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) Subscale test is the standard assessment tool and one of the most popular cognitive testing instrument in clinical trials. It is designed to assess various cognitive abilities such as those associated with memory, language and praxis. It consists of 11 parts: 1. Word Recall Task; 2. Naming Task; 3: Commands; 4: Constructional Praxis; 5. Ideational Praxis; 6. Orientation; 7. Word Recognition Task; 8. Language; 9. Comprehension of Spoken Language; 10. Word Finding Difficulty; and 11. Remembering Test Instructions. Scores range from 0 to 70 with lower scores indicating lesser severity. ADAS-Cog was measured at Screening, Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12.</description>

          <title>Change in ADAS-cog Score at All Post Treatment Visits (Except Week 12 Visit) Compared to Baseline</title>
          <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale- Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) Subscale test is the standard assessment tool and one of the most popular cognitive testing instrument in clinical trials. It is designed to assess various cognitive abilities such as those associated with memory, language and praxis. It consists of 11 parts: 1. Word Recall Task; 2. Naming Task; 3: Commands; 4: Constructional Praxis; 5. Ideational Praxis; 6. Orientation; 7. Word Recognition Task; 8. Language; 9. Comprehension of Spoken Language; 10. Word Finding Difficulty; and 11. Remembering Test Instructions. Scores range from 0 to 70 with lower scores indicating lesser severity. ADAS-Cog was measured at Screening, Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12.</description>

        <description>This is a global measure of detectable change in cognition, function and behavior. The format for CIBIS/CIBIC-Plus consists of the assessment of an independent clinician based on observation of the patient at an interview, and information provided by the caregiver. The clinician's assessing severity at baseline and overall impression for assessing severity of the global change in disease severity, compared with baseline, is rated. The CIBIS/CIBIC plus examined general, cognitive, and behavioral function and activities of daily living on a 7-point categorical rating scale, ranging from a score of 0 indicating &quot;Not assessed&quot;, to a score of 7 indicating &quot;Among the most extremely ill patients&quot; for CIBIS and ranging from 1 indicating &quot;Very much improved&quot;, to a score of 7 indicating &quot;Marked worsening&quot;, and with a score of 4 indicating &quot;no change&quot; for CIBIC-Plus. CIBIS was measured at Randomization visit and CIBIC-Plus was measured at Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.</description>

        <description>An inventory of informant based items to assess activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, i.e. functional performance, of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It consists of 23-item inventory of ADL, rated based on extent of assistance the patient requires (independently, with supervision, with physical help): 0 (total independence in performing an activity) to 4 (total inability to act independently). Each question varies in the number of options to choose. Total score range: 0 to 78; higher scores indicate less functional impairment. ADL will be measured at Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.</description>

ADL will be measured at Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.</description>

        <title>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score at All Post Treatment Visits Compared to Baseline: NPI-10 Frequency Ã— Severity</title>
        <description>The NPI is the behavior instrument most widely used in clinical trials of anti-dementia agents. The NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time, examining and scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses to screening questions. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined. Information for the NPI is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the patient's behavior. The NPI assesses 10 behavioral domains (10-item NPI, section A~J) common in dementia. Each NPI domain is scored by the caregiver based on a standardized interview administered by the clinician. Frequency is scored from 1 (occasionally) to 4 (very frequently) and severity is rated from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe). The score for each domain is frequency multiplied by severity. Therefore, the score ranges from 1 to 12 with higher scores indicate worse condition. NPI was measured at Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.</description>

The NPI assesses 10 behavioral domains (10-item NPI) common in dementia. Each NPI domain is scored by the caregiver based on a standardized interview administered by the clinician. NPI-10 Caregiver Distress score is scored for associated caregiver distress from 0 (no distress) to 5 (very severe or extreme). Higher scores indicate greater distress. NPI was measured at Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.</description>

        <title>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score at All Post Treatment Visits Compared to Baseline: NPI-12 Frequency Ã— Severity Score</title>
        <description>The NPI is the behavior instrument most widely used in clinical trials of anti-dementia agents. The NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time, examining and scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses to screening questions. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined. Information for the NPI is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the patient's behavior. The NPI assesses 12 behavioral domains (12-item NPI) common in dementia. Each NPI domain is scored by the caregiver based on a standardized interview administered by the clinician. Frequency is scored from 1 (occasionally) to 4 (very frequently) and severity is rated from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe). The score for each domain is frequency multiplied by severity. Therefore, the score ranges from 1 to 12 with higher scores indicate worse condition. NPI was measured at Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a study medication and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study medication, whether or not related to the study medication. Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs unless determined to be clinically significant by the Investigator. The number of participants with adverse events within the BAC and placebo groups was determined.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</title>
          <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a study medication and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study medication, whether or not related to the study medication. Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs unless determined to be clinically significant by the Investigator. The number of participants with adverse events within the BAC and placebo groups was determined.</description>

        <description>This is a multi-item instrument that examines orientation, registration, attention, calculation, recall, visuospatial abilities and language. The maximum score is 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. ).&#xD;
&quot;Responder&quot; analysis consist of two steps. (1) The baseline MMSE score is deducted from the post-treatment visit MMSE score; (2) the minus baseline score in step 1 is being dichotomized into two binary variable of either &quot;responder&quot; or &quot;non-responder&quot;. Patients who make progress or remain unchanged on the cognitive test compared to baseline are considered as &quot;responders&quot;, whereas patients who have deterioration on the cognitive test compared to baseline are considered as &quot;non-responders&quot;.</description>
