  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are known to be affected by subtle cognitive&#xD;
      impairment early in the disease course, mostly in the executive field. Procedural motor&#xD;
      skills, mainly controlled by the basal ganglia associative loop (in particular dorsal caudate&#xD;
      nucleus) (Rodriguez-Oroz et al., 2009), have also been studied in patients with PD (Schnider&#xD;
      et al., 1995; Muslimovic et al., 2007; Terpening et al., 2013). However, the correlation of&#xD;
      dopaminergic 123I-FP-CIT SPECT imaging and cognitive impairment has not been assessed. One&#xD;
      reason is the absence of reference values for striatal uptake until recently. Last year, the&#xD;
      investigators established local uptake reference values for DAT imaging based on a large&#xD;
      cohort of subjects with non-degenerative conditions (Nicastro et al., 2016) and can therefore&#xD;
      use these values to precisely assess uptake loss in patients with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the present study, the investigators expect to enroll patients with early PD for whom a&#xD;
      123I-FP-CIT SPECT has been previously performed in the center. Subjects will perform a&#xD;
      specific motor task based on mirror-drawing of star-shaped figures. This will be done by&#xD;
      inverting the direction of horizontal/vertical computer mouse movements on the screen. Speed&#xD;
      and error rates will be assessed for patients as well as healthy control subjects.&#xD;
      Correlation with striatal SPECT uptake, especially caudate nucleus uptake, will be analyzed&#xD;
      for PD patients. In addition, resting-state EEG will be performed for all subjects. General&#xD;
      medication and dopaminergic drugs in particular, whenever used, will not be discontinued. For&#xD;
      all subjects enrolled in the study, cognitive and neurological examination will be performed.&#xD;
