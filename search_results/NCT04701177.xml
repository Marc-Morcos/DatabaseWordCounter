      The study is carried out as part of the GR2021 Priority project &quot;Healthy Brains for life (Age&#xD;
      20-99): Digitally-enhanced personalized medicine study ANANEOS&quot; and code numbered GR-00546&#xD;
      and it will look at the decentralized and remote assessment of the symptoms of preclinical&#xD;
      stages in Alzheimer's disease and movement disorders, e.g. Parkinson's. For this study we are&#xD;
      looking for participants aged over 45 without cognitive complaints or with subjective&#xD;
      perception of cognitive decline or with mild cognitive complaints. Specific aims for the&#xD;
      proposed study: a) to develop novel sensitive measures that can provide an early&#xD;
      identification of those SCD and MCI individuals harboring AD pathology that are at high risk&#xD;
      of cognitive worsening over time; b) to track pre-motor stages in Parkinson's disease and&#xD;
      trials that enable active digital functional biomarkers; c) to track disease progression&#xD;
      during pre-dementia and pre-motor stages in clinical practice and trials with measures that&#xD;
      enable to capture subtle changes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Digital technologies, particularly those based on the use of smartphones, wearables and/or&#xD;
      home-based monitoring devices, here defined as 'Remote Measurement Technologies' (RMTs),&#xD;
      provide an opportunity to change radically the way in which functional assessment is&#xD;
      undertaken in AD, RMTs have the potential to obtain better measurements of behavioural and&#xD;
      biological parameters associated with individual Activities of Daily Living (ADL) when&#xD;
      compared to the current subjective scales or questionnaires. Divergence from normative ADL&#xD;
      profiles could objectively indicate the presence of specific incipient functional impairments&#xD;
      even at the very early stages of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the main hypothesis of this project is that RMTs should allow the detection of&#xD;
      impairments in functional components of ADLs that occur below the threshold of clinical scale&#xD;
      detection or disability questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANANEOS is an independent Brain Registry (patient registry), created as an organized system&#xD;
      to collect uniform data (clinical and other) to evaluate specified outcomes for the&#xD;
      Neurological Progression Index (NPI) and serves as a real-world view of clinical practice,&#xD;
      patient outcomes, safety, and can serve a number of evidence development and decision making&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
