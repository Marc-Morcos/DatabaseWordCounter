      proof-of-concept study to adequately design a larger trial to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      supplementation of a probiotic (SLAB51) on AD biomarker.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence suggests an effect of gut bacteria and their&#xD;
      metabolites on brain health, including the development of neurodegenerative conditions and&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Probiotic supplementation is commonplace in medicine but targeting&#xD;
      the gut microbiome to prevent AD is poorly understood and little is known on the dynamic&#xD;
      effects of probiotics on physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: This is a proof-of-concept study to adequately design a larger trial to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of supplementation of a probiotic (SLAB51) on AD biomarker. The study will use a high&#xD;
      frequency sampling to closely monitor the physiological dynamics as the result of low and&#xD;
      high dose consumption of the probiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Study subjects will be three patients with prodromal AD between 60 and 80 years old&#xD;
      and carrying the apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele. Participants will sequentially receive no&#xD;
      supplement (run-in), low and high doses of probiotics for five consecutive days with a&#xD;
      washout period in-between. Blood and stools will be collected every day or every second days.&#xD;
      The main readout will be the established plasma markers of AD, and more exploratory analysis&#xD;
      will be performed on putative mediators of the gut-brain axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED OUTCOME: Curves of dynamic change of the readouts will be built for each subject,&#xD;
      and a model of the response will be estimated. The results of this project will help design a&#xD;
      larger trial to identify the most promising analytes showing a dynamic response to probiotic&#xD;
      consumption and better understand the link to the pathology.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study design will allow to evaluate the dose dependent effect of probiotic consumption on AD blood-based biomarker by comparing each individual to its baseline sampling.&#xD;
Each participant will follow a 3 phases program of identical procedures:&#xD;
Phase I - baseline control: no probiotic will be consumed&#xD;
Phase II - Low dose probiotic consumption: 1 dose of probiotic will be taken in the morning for 5 days&#xD;
Phase III - High dose probiotic consumption: The subject will receive 1 dose of probiotic in the morning and one dose in the evening for 5 days&#xD;
In all phases (2 weeks time) blood, stools, cardiometabolic parameter, food frequency, cognitive, anxiety and depression assessment will be collected at specific time points (either shortly before, during or shortly after the treatment period).</intervention_model_description>
