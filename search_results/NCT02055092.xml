  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People diagnosed with young onset dementia are today mostly assigned to the same healthcare&#xD;
      services as people developing dementia at an older age. They and their families are however&#xD;
      in a quite different life situation, which is likely to generate different challenges and&#xD;
      specific needs for tailored healthcare services, of importance in maintaining their perceived&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators of this study wish to assess the factors influencing these families'&#xD;
      quality of life, their specific needs and their use of healthcare services by the use a&#xD;
      combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The main aim of this study is to provide&#xD;
      better future healthcare services to these families, and to develop a programme for optimal&#xD;
      collaboration between specialist healthcare services and the local dementia teams.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Most common dementia cases in Young Onset dementia (YOD) are Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). There is little knowledge about the impact on the&#xD;
      affected families, especially with regard to FTD. Although their life situation and specific&#xD;
      needs differ from that of older people, they are referred to the same healthcare services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. QoL is poorer among persons with FTD and their families compared to AD at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is less worsening of QoL after two years in persons with AD and their families&#xD;
           compared to FTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. People with YOD have different needs for health care services than older people with&#xD;
           dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. YOD and their families have more unmet needs than older people with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Nordic multicenter observational cohort study of YOD-AD and YOD-FTD. 75 persons in&#xD;
      each group, living at home with their families, recruited from five Norwegian and four Nordic&#xD;
      memory clinics. The control group consists of 100 older people with dementia age â‰¥70 years.&#xD;
      The investigators use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up period of the persons with YOD and their family members is two years.&#xD;
      Assessments are made at baseline, 12 and 24 months, with telephone check-ups at 6 and 18&#xD;
      months. The main assessment questionnaires are Quality of life in Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (QoL-AD), Camberwell Assessment of Need in the Elderly (CANE), and Resource Utilization in&#xD;
      Dementia Lite (RUD Lite).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims for the quantitative part of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the quality of life of persons with YOD and their family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify and explore the specific needs of YOD and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the use of health resources and calculate the costs associated with care for&#xD;
           YOD, in comparison with older persons with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the functional characteristics of YOD with older people with dementia in&#xD;
           terms of cognitive decline, impairment of activities of daily living, changes in&#xD;
           behavior, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims and methods for the qualitative part of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate how people living alone with young-onset dementia cope with everyday life&#xD;
           and decision-making. A longitudinal study with qualitative interviews at 6, 12, 24, 36&#xD;
           and 48 months after initial diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate how it is to be a spouse/cohabitation to a person with young-onset of&#xD;
           frontotemporal dementia. A retrospective and prospective study with qualitative&#xD;
           interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate adult children's experiences with the support they received after their&#xD;
           parent with young-onset dementia received a dementia diagnose. A retrospective and&#xD;
           prospective study with qualitative interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate carers of people with young-onset dementia experiences with the support&#xD;
           contact service. A longitudinell study study with qualitative interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Inclusion starts Feb 2014. The objective of this study is to ensure optimally&#xD;
      tailored service provision and future healthcare planning according to the specific needs of&#xD;
      families of YOD, and develop a care programme in collaboration between primary and specialist&#xD;
      healthcare services.&#xD;
