  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research program is to improve understanding of the mechanistic&#xD;
      link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, acute delirium, and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment following acute respiratory failure. In this pilot study, the study team will&#xD;
      establish a prospective cohort of older patients with acute respiratory failure and obtain&#xD;
      data on delirium duration, AD imaging and CSF biomarkers, and cognitive outcomes following&#xD;
      critical illness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study team will recruit patients with no known history of dementia for enrollment into&#xD;
      the cohort during their hospital stay for acute respiratory failure. The cohort will undergo&#xD;
      testing including cognitive testing, MRI imaging, lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF) analysis at 3 months following hospital discharge. The study will examine the&#xD;
      association of delirium duration during the hospital stay and cognitive impairment at 3 month&#xD;
      follow-up with CSF levels of amyloid- Î²42, tau, and phospho-tau. Measures of delirium will&#xD;
      also be related with structural/functional MRI dependent measures. The goal is to design a&#xD;
      larger prospective cohort study to evaluate the relationship between AD imaging and CSF&#xD;
      biomarkers with delirium and post-ICU cognitive impairment. The results of this pilot study&#xD;
      with provide important information with regard to future study design including: (1) ratio of&#xD;
      eligible to recruited patients (2) retention rate; (3) safety and feasibility of protocol;&#xD;
      and (4) preliminary effect size estimates.&#xD;

        We propose to recruit older patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical&#xD;
        ventilation admitted to the medical ICU of an academic medical center, Wake Forest Baptist&#xD;
