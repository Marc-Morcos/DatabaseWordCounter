  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn about tau tangles in Alzheimer's disease. A type of&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) scan is used to measure the abnormal accumulation of&#xD;
      protein called tau in the brain. These are thought to be involved in Alzheimer's disease. The&#xD;
      investigators will also perform brain MRI and to tests to measure the participant's memory&#xD;
      and thinking.&#xD;

      This study is being done to determine the relationship between tau tangles and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment in elderly subjects with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects will&#xD;
      undergo screen that includes neuropsychological testing and brain MRI. This study uses a&#xD;
      special type of scan called a PET scan to take pictures of the brain. During the PET scan, a&#xD;
      special radioactive dye called 18F-MK-6240 is injected into the body. 18F-MK-6240 sticks to&#xD;
      abnormal tangles made of the protein tau. Subjects will have the option to have lumbar&#xD;
      puncture performed to measure CSF concentrations of biomarkers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 50 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Meet criteria for either&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (single or mixed domain) or mild&#xD;
                  Alzheimer's disease (AD), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. have no cognitive impairment, based on history, exam, neuropsychological testing,&#xD;
                  and consensus diagnosis. MCI and mild AD patients must have Clinical Dementia&#xD;
                  Rating scale score of 0.5 or 1. Unimpaired subjects must have Clinical Dementia&#xD;
                  Rating scale score of 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects unable to provide informed consent must have a surrogate decision maker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Written and oral fluency in English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able to participate in all scheduled evaluations and to complete all required tests&#xD;
             and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject must be considered likely to comply&#xD;
             with the study protocol and to have a high probability of completing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Past or present history of certain brain disorders other than MCI or AD.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Conditions precluding entry into the scanners (e.g. morbid obesity, claustrophobia,&#xD;
             etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of kidney disease or presence of impaired kidney function based on laboratory&#xD;
             tests at screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of liver disease or presence of impaired liver function based on laboratory&#xD;
             tests at screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participation in the last year in a clinical trial for a disease modifying drug for&#xD;
             AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Inability to have a catheter in subject's vein for the injection of radioligand.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Inability to have blood drawn from subject's veins.&#xD;
