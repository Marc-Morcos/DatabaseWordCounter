  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 2 periods: [1] Study Period A - evaluating the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Crenezumab versus Placebo in participants who carry the PSEN1 E280A autosomal-dominant&#xD;
      mutation and do not meet the criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to AD or dementia due&#xD;
      to AD and are thus, in a preclinical phase of AD. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive either Crenezumab or Placebo subcutaneously (every 2 weeks) or intravenously&#xD;
      (every 4 weeks) for at least 260 weeks. A cohort of participants (non-mutation carriers) will&#xD;
      also be enrolled and will be dosed solely on Placebo and [2] Study Period B - Participants&#xD;
      will be offered the opportunity to continue to receive study drug until the results of the&#xD;
      study are known and post trial access to Crenezumab is started or development of Crenezumab&#xD;
      is discontinued.&#xD;
