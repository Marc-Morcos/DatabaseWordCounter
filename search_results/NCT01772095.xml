  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1906, Dr. Alois Alzheimer first described the disease that later took his name. Today, 100&#xD;
      years later, 24 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease or other dementias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term 'dementia' is clinical and is used to describe brain disorders that cause decline in&#xD;
      mental functions, memory first and then speech, judging and overall behavior. Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease is by far the most common form of dementia, followed by vascular dementia, dementia&#xD;
      with Lewy, the frontotemporal dementias etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Greece there are 141,000 patients with dementia. With increasing life expectancy, the&#xD;
      figures are expected to increase dramatically in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, as well as 50-60% of patients with&#xD;
      dementia suffer from this disease. The second most common type of dementia is vascular, ie&#xD;
      that associated with cerebrovascular disease and is the 15-30% of all dementia cases and is&#xD;
      most common between the ages of 60-70 years and is more common in men than women. It is&#xD;
      estimated that 5% to 8% of people over 65 suffer from dementia, while in industrialized&#xD;
      countries ranges at the following levels :15-25% over 85 and 32% over 90 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dementia is characterized by a slow onset and progressive course. The syndrome includes&#xD;
      disorders in general intelligence, learning and memory, problem solving, perception,&#xD;
      judgment, executive function, language and synergy of movement, but without impairment of&#xD;
      consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder with distinct clinical and&#xD;
      histopathological features, although with variations from person to person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In its early stages it is sometimes difficult to diagnose cognitive impairment from normal&#xD;
      aging of the brain. With the passage of time, the continuous decline in recent memory,&#xD;
      fluency, ability for spatial orientation ultimately restricts the autonomy regarding basic&#xD;
      activities of daily life such as managing finances. The anxiety and depression complicate&#xD;
      diagnosis in early stages, but gradually decline with loss of sensitivity. Intermediate&#xD;
      stages of the disease require increasingly supervision in daily self-care activities, such as&#xD;
      personal hygiene and clothing. In the advanced stages are usually essential nursing care in&#xD;
      institutional context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of symptoms of the disease varies and is determined by premorbid factors such as&#xD;
      education, gender, cultural background. Epidemiological studies have shown as protective&#xD;
      factors against the onset of dementia, higher education, taking estrogen and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs. On the other hand, age, family history of dementia, head injury,&#xD;
      hypertension and Down syndrome are risk factors for developing the disease. Finally, some&#xD;
      genetic factors appear to be protective, and other pressures to the disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments aim to control the symptoms of the disease. Important parameter is the&#xD;
      early diagnosis and early care. The delay in onset of symptoms five years would reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of disease by 50% per generation, while complementary therapies and delay entry&#xD;
      into institutions would reduce costs considerably. This is the rationale of medication,&#xD;
      currently until it causative treatment. The cost of dementia to society as intolerable by the&#xD;
      year 2030 it is estimated that a 20% of the population will be over 65. Thus e.g. cost of $&#xD;
      15 billion currently available in the U.S. for the care of people with dementia are likely to&#xD;
      rise further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Challenge of tackling Alzheimer disease is slowing the degenerative disease process,&#xD;
      influencing with any pharmaceutical interventions in various parameters involved in the&#xD;
      degeneration of the neuron, resulting in no further for a short-time-charge of the patient's&#xD;
      cognition and - the possible load-relief of the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholinesterase inhibitors are now a documented, effective treatment of the symptoms of&#xD;
      Alzheimer disease and therefore are appropriate pharmaceutical intervention. Donepezil has&#xD;
      been shown to help and behavioral problems of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aging and Dementia Aging as a biological phenomenon leads to irreversible morphologic changes&#xD;
      in all body systems. The changes are related to the nervous system can eventually lead to&#xD;
      dementia. The population of elderly people is increasing in all developed countries, thereby&#xD;
      creating a variety of social, economic and mainly medical problems. This finding has brought&#xD;
      interest has to those pathological conditions which are manifested by symptoms that have some&#xD;
      qualitative similarity to those of old age and thus both contribute to further expansion in&#xD;
      the number of this group of the population and also create diagnostic problems.&#xD;
      Morphological, neurochemical and neuropsychological changes that occur in normal aging and&#xD;
      dementia observed, especially in Alzheimer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dementias are costly illnesses. In Europe today, the cost of care for people with dementia&#xD;
      exceeds the cost of illnesses such as heart disease, cancer and strokes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last 20 years have been tremendous advances in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have significantly increased our knowledge of the predisposing factors of the disease, which&#xD;
      helps to prevent. The control of vascular risk factors (hypertension, obesity, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking) is beneficial for both the brain and the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system. Diet low in fat, fish and vegetarian consumption associated with&#xD;
      decreased risk of Disease Alzheimer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis at early clinical stages is possible. An experienced physician can diagnose&#xD;
      Alzheimer's with certainty up to 90% by combining the diagnostic tools at his disposal&#xD;
      (neuroimaging methods, biomarkers, genetic testing). The pathological process in the brain of&#xD;
      patients with Alzheimer's disease begins decades before the appearance of clinical symptoms.&#xD;
      The etiology is probably multifactorial. Today intensively sought ways identification of&#xD;
      candidate patients and investigated the possibility of non-specific factors (such as&#xD;
      hormones, antioxidant vitamins, or anti-inflammatory agents) can reverse or delay the&#xD;
      pathogenic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intercultural, people less educated the incidence of dementia is greater. Specially-designed&#xD;
      studies have shown that continuing education in adulthood increases cognitive reserve and&#xD;
      probably protects against dementia. Those who exercised spiritually (studying, reading)&#xD;
      suffer Alzheimer's disease less frequently or in a milder form. Physical exercise and fitness&#xD;
      also contribute significantly to the prevention of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today's symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer disease . Our experience with drugs called&#xD;
      angiotensin cholinesterases (ARICEPT, EXELON, REMINYL) as with the NMDA antagonist (EBIXA)&#xD;
      demonstrated that early initiation of treatment significantly slows disease progression&#xD;
      Alzheimer, and other dementia syndromes (Vascular and mixed dementia, dementia with Lewy&#xD;
      bodies and Alzheimer's Dementia Parkinson).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also the non-drug approach the patient exercises involving memory and attention,&#xD;
      cognitive empowerment programs, therapy memories orientation to reality. Knowledge&#xD;
      empowerment programs aimed at the exploitation of the cognitive functions of patients who&#xD;
      remain at a satisfactory level. By using a wide variety of stimuli and specialized methods&#xD;
      appropriately stimulated brain of patients and achieve the desired result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dementia in the early stages is not easy to diagnose because the public confuses the&#xD;
      symptoms to those of normal aging. Still prevalent misconception that nothing can help these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that demented patients are usually examined by a specialist 3 years&#xD;
      after experiencing the first symptoms of the disease. This delay in diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      has a negative impact on the progress of the disease. Accurate and early diagnosis of&#xD;
      dementia, ensure early intervention, smoother transition stages of the disease and a better&#xD;
      quality of life for patients and their families for a longer period of time. It also allows&#xD;
      further targeted prevention and treatment strategies, medical or otherwise.&#xD;
