      Specific Aim 1: To determine feasibility of a 20-minute dyadic exercise program for&#xD;
      ambulatory individuals with dementia and caregivers living at home based on recruitment,&#xD;
      adherence and retention. Investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      with 20 dyads (total N = 40) in groups of 5 randomized to 16-week group exercise classes and&#xD;
      regular home practice or wait list in a cross-over design. Investigators will assess&#xD;
      feasibility of enrollment and retention, the proportion of completed outcome measures, and&#xD;
      adherence by class attendance logs, caregiver-reported home practice logs and qualitative&#xD;
      interviews to assess ease of implementation in the home environment. Investigators will&#xD;
      explore feasibility of weekly phone calls to (potentially overwhelmed) caregivers and Fit-bit&#xD;
      accelerometers as a measure for tracking home practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To collect preliminary effect size data for sample size calculation for a&#xD;
      larger trial. Investigators will assess standard outcomes (such as the Short Physical&#xD;
      Performance Battery and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale as primary&#xD;
      outcomes for affected individuals; and Caregiver Burden Inventory for caregivers) commonly&#xD;
      used in pharmacological studies of individuals with dementia at baseline, 16 and 32 weeks and&#xD;
      calculate effect sizes (Cohen's d) for between-group differences in outcome changes in the 20&#xD;
      dyads of the RCT described in Specific Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using non-invasive Near-Infrared Spectroscopy&#xD;
      (NIRS) to assess regional cortical brain oxygenation and its sensitivity to change.&#xD;
      Investigators will compare brain oxygenation variations before and after the exercise&#xD;
      intervention during a memory task for the seniors with dementia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a major public health challenge for our century. Research into&#xD;
      pharmaceutical therapies has been disappointing and not provided any safe medications that&#xD;
      can halt the disease's trajectory of decline in the cognitive, functional, emotional and&#xD;
      social capabilities of the affected individuals. For non-pharmacological approaches,&#xD;
      multi-domain exercise programs that address several of these capabilities in an integrated&#xD;
      way have shown strong promise for their ability to slow the decline. The team of&#xD;
      investigators has systematically developed one such program-the Preventing Loss of&#xD;
      Independence through Exercise (PLIÉ) program-an integrative exercise program that uses&#xD;
      procedural memory (memory for movements without explicit recall), can be taught at and&#xD;
      integrated into senior day care centers and has been pilot-tested by our team with&#xD;
      encouraging results for functional, cognitive and social outcomes (see Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, (1) most people in the community do not have access to a day care center, are&#xD;
      concerned about the stigma associated with day care or are unable to afford it. This was&#xD;
      endorsed by semi-structured interviews conducted with caregivers and community-based&#xD;
      organizations in preparation for a larger study of the PLIÉ program. There is a huge need for&#xD;
      innovative programs to assist individuals with dementia and their caregivers in the&#xD;
      community. Irrespective of having access to day care or not, motivated caregivers, who are&#xD;
      aware of the benefits of exercises for their loved ones and spend hours alone with them at&#xD;
      home, ask: &quot;What can we do with our [e.g. mother]?&quot; They point out a major lack of guidance&#xD;
      for caregivers in the community to be able to use a regular exercise practice on a long-term&#xD;
      basis at home. Caregivers and seniors with dementia living together in the community are&#xD;
      dyads in need of a paired exercise program. (2) How exercise may delay cognitive and&#xD;
      functional decline is unknown. One hypothetical mechanism of action is an improved brain&#xD;
      oxygenation related to exercise. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method&#xD;
      to assess regional cortical oxygenation levels, has been suggested for the early diagnosis of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's dementia, but has never been applied to longitudinal studies in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired home exercise programs for seniors with dementia and their primary caregivers have&#xD;
      rarely been studied. A pilot study that used 6 'sticky hands' movement variations based on&#xD;
      Tai Chi, music and exercise incentives found improvements in 2 outcome measures considered to&#xD;
      be important in fall prevention (sit-to-stand time, one-legged stance time). However,&#xD;
      movements were limited to tai chi and outcomes to fall-related function, leaving out&#xD;
      cognitive function for which the PLIÉ program had shown such promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group of investigators is an established collaboration between the Osher Center for&#xD;
      Integrative Medicine and the Department of Psychiatry at UCSF and has recently pioneered a&#xD;
      novel, 45-minute, multi-domain program called Preventing Loss of Independence through&#xD;
      Exercise (PLIÉ) that integrates physical activity (training of procedural memory for basic&#xD;
      daily activities such as sitting and standing), cognitive stimulation (mindful body&#xD;
      awareness), social engagement (group movement and sharing of in-the-moment experiences), and&#xD;
      caregiver education (monthly home-visit). The investigators pilot-tested PLIÉ in 11&#xD;
      individuals with mild to moderate dementia who were attending an adult day program at the&#xD;
      Institute of Aging in San Francisco, CA (ClinicalTrials.gov registered NCT01371214), and&#xD;
      found (Table 1) preliminary evidence of medium to large, clinically meaningful effect sizes&#xD;
      com-pared to usual care (UC; 45 minutes of usual chair-based exercises at the day care&#xD;
      center) across a wide range of out-comes including measures of quality of life (0.83),&#xD;
      cognitive function (0.76), physical performance (0.34) and caregiver burden (0.49).7,11 That&#xD;
      study methodologically mimicked a drug study by including measures that are commonly used in&#xD;
      dementia medication trials, which enabled comparison of the magnitude of our results to&#xD;
      currently available dementia medications.. The investigators are now completing data&#xD;
      collection for a second implementation of the PLIÉ program at an adult day program in San&#xD;
      Rafael, CA (Senior Access). The intervention of the current proposal will be similar to PLIÉ&#xD;
      in using the same principles6 and taught by instructors trained in the PLIÉ program. However,&#xD;
      it will differ in its format: instead of a day-care center-based group program taught by&#xD;
      professional exercise instructors, it uses a dyadic approach, introduced through caregiver&#xD;
      support groups to pairs of individuals with dementia and their caregivers, initially using a&#xD;
      group class format, but taught to enable caregivers to practice independently at home. To&#xD;
      allow for wide-spread long-term routine application, it will be brief (20 minutes), use&#xD;
      personalized music associated with positive affect memories, and be supported by video&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 papers have been published about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose studying a paired integrative exercise intervention that&#xD;
      can be practiced in dyads of caregivers and affected individuals at home or in a&#xD;
      community-based support group environment, does not require additional equipment, can be&#xD;
      easily learned by caregivers, and may ameliorate the impact of dementia for older persons and&#xD;
      caregivers. The investigators suggest a multimodal program that is based on implicit&#xD;
      procedural learning and the integrative principles of the PLIÉ program: it includes physical&#xD;
      (through touch) and social interaction with a trusted family member, focuses on physical&#xD;
      function such as balance, includes personalized music choices and singing, supports positive&#xD;
      affect, and uses language to cognitively enhance the experience of mind-body integration. It&#xD;
      promotes a playful, non-judgmental supportive attitude to foster a sense of embodied&#xD;
      personhood in individuals with dementia through joyful social interaction with an empowered&#xD;
      caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment. Study participants will be recruited from local caregiver support groups of&#xD;
           Kaiser Permanente in Oakland. Exercise instructors and the PI have already been invited&#xD;
           to give presentations at their regular meetings. Contacts have been established with 3&#xD;
           caregiver support groups meeting at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, totaling about 100&#xD;
           caregivers, who meet once a month and confirmed strong interest to participate. Thus, it&#xD;
           is highly likely that we will twice be able to recruit 10 dyads of eligible&#xD;
           participants. In addition, investigators will give study flyers to caregiver support&#xD;
           managers at Kaiser Permanente, the local Alzheimer's Association groups, and the&#xD;
           Alzheimer's Services of the East Bay (ASEB). In addition, we will recruit at ASEB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Caregivers will be informed about the study by brief presentations by the PI and an&#xD;
           exercise instructor during regular support group meetings. A flyer will be handed to&#xD;
           interested potential participants describing the study and providing an opportunity to&#xD;
           learn more by returning a form or calling the research study staff. Those caregivers who&#xD;
           express interest will be contacted by research staff by phone to further assess&#xD;
           interest/eligibility and to schedule a consent visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Informed consent. Verbal consent to be screened will be obtained over the telephone&#xD;
           prior to collecting information on demographics and medical and psychiatric history.&#xD;
           Written consent will be obtained with the affected individuals and caregivers together,&#xD;
           as described in more detail below. The consent forms will be reviewed and capacity to&#xD;
           consent will be assessed in primary participants based on responses to questions to&#xD;
           determine level of understanding of study procedures, risks, benefits and rights.&#xD;
           Participants who do not demonstrate capacity to consent will be asked to assent to study&#xD;
           procedures and caregivers will be asked to consent on their behalf. A separate consent&#xD;
           form will request permission to participate in video recording of exercise classes for&#xD;
           quality control purposes. After the consent process has been completed, the Modified&#xD;
           Mini-Mental State Exam (3MS) will be administered to affected individuals to assess&#xD;
           level of cognitive impairment. Consent procedures will take place at the Kaiser group&#xD;
           room unless otherwise requested by caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the caregiver is not the Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) or the legal&#xD;
           guardian of the affected individual, the screening interview will be stopped.&#xD;
           Investigators will then mail a letter to the LAR or legal guardian and invite her/him to&#xD;
           contact us by mail or phone to discuss the study and the consent process. The screening&#xD;
           and eligibility questions for the affected individual will then be completed with the&#xD;
           LAR or legal guardian. If investigators do not get a response within 2 weeks they will&#xD;
           call the LAR or legal guardian by phone assuming that she/he has received our letter.&#xD;
           Only if this person permits the affected individual's study participation investigators&#xD;
           will contact the caregiver and the affected individual again.&#xD;
&#xD;
           How will investigators assess the potential participant's capacity to consent? Capacity&#xD;
           to consent will be assessed by research assistants (RA) who will be extensively trained&#xD;
           by the PI and co-investigators using a standardized procedure. Investigators first&#xD;
           provide the consent form to the patient and caregiver together and allow them to review&#xD;
           it. RAs then describe the key points of the form, pointing to the areas on the form&#xD;
           where the information is described in more detail. They then ask a series of yes/no&#xD;
           questions to assess understanding of the information in the form. If the participant&#xD;
           cannot answer the questions, RAs review the material again and point to the section on&#xD;
           the form. Investigators then repeat the questions. If participants are unable to answer&#xD;
           all of the questions on their own after review, RAs consider them to lack capacity to&#xD;
           consent. RAs then ask them if they would like to participate in the study to obtain&#xD;
           their assent. RAs say that they are going to ask the caregiver to sign the form on the&#xD;
           participant's behalf to obtain written consent. Most of the team's research assistants&#xD;
           have been and are psychology graduate students who are highly sensitive to working with&#xD;
           vulnerable patients. Investigators train new research staff by having them role play the&#xD;
           consent process until senior personnel determine that they are adequately prepared. They&#xD;
           then observe senior personnel performing the consent process on at least one study&#xD;
           participant. Subsequently they are observed performing the consent process until senior&#xD;
           personnel determine that they are competent. Investigators/RAs also have weekly team&#xD;
           meetings to discuss any difficulties that arise during consent or any other study&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization: Following the baseline assessments, assessing staff will open an opaque,&#xD;
           sealed envelop for each dyad (affected individual and caregiver). Envelops will be&#xD;
           numbered and will contain the group assignment. A statistician not involved in the study&#xD;
           will prepare these envelops and create a random sequence of numbers using a computer&#xD;
           program. There will be 2 piles of envelops, one for men and one for women to recruit a&#xD;
           similar proportions of male and female participants in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 1st Pilot-test Phase. Affected individual/caregiver dyads who consented will be invited&#xD;
           to participate in the first pilot phase of 10 dyads. These subjects will participate in&#xD;
           either Group 1 (initial intervention), which will participate first, or Group 2 (wait&#xD;
           list control group). Group 1 will participate in the Paired PLIÉ program 2 times/week&#xD;
           for 45 minutes for 4 weeks and then once/month for additional 3 months while Group 2&#xD;
           will be wait-listed. After Group 1 has completed their training, Group 2 will&#xD;
           participate in the PLIÉ program 2 times/week for 45 minutes for 4 weeks and then&#xD;
           once/month for additional 3 months. Group assignment will be random. Investigators will&#xD;
           strive to have an equal distribution of men/women in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention: the exercise protocol is based on the PLIÉ protocol, which the&#xD;
           investigators have developed in consultation with experts worldwide who have experience&#xD;
           performing different types of exercises in individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia,&#xD;
           including traditional strength-building exercises, yoga, Tai Chi and Feldenkrais.&#xD;
           Specifically, investigators have identified exercises from each of these traditions that&#xD;
           engage the muscles most needed to maintain independence--including lower body strength&#xD;
           (to help with getting out of bed/chair), balance (to minimize risk of falls), upper body&#xD;
           strength (to help with lifting), fine motor exercises (to help with activities such as&#xD;
           eating and brushing teeth), and pelvic floor exercises (to help with continence)--and&#xD;
           have combined them into a unique integrative exercise program. These exercises are&#xD;
           designed to be purposeful (i.e., to achieve a goal) and to build procedural ('muscle')&#xD;
           memory. In addition, breathing and guided meditation exercises are included to promote&#xD;
           relaxation and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
           While the PLIÉ program has been tested in a senior day care setting, investigators are&#xD;
           combining these exercises in a new way, that they can be practiced at home in dyads of&#xD;
           affected individuals and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 2nd Pilot-test Phase. In a second phase investigators will repeat the identical protocol&#xD;
           and intervention with 10 more dyads of affected individuals and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pre- and post-intervention assessment. Investigators will perform a variety of standard&#xD;
           measures in all participants and caregivers. The following assessments will occur at&#xD;
           baseline and after the 3 follow-up months. They will primarily be utilized to assess&#xD;
           feasibility and logistics of data collection procedures. Separate appointments will be&#xD;
           made for affected individuals and caregivers to maximize the validity of data collected&#xD;
           (e.g., to ensure that caregivers do not 'help' affected individuals with answers to&#xD;
           questions and feel comfortable providing information about issues such as difficult&#xD;
           behaviors or levels of stress). Affected individuals assessments will take place at the&#xD;
           group room. The initial caregiver assessment will take place at the caregiver's home or&#xD;
           the group room. The first line of communication for follow-up appointments will be via&#xD;
           telephone or in person to minimize the risk of loss of privacy. At the caregiver&#xD;
           participant's request, further communication may be conducted via mail, email, fax or&#xD;
           text. Caregivers will be informed that these modes of communication may increase their&#xD;
           risk of loss of privacy. Mail, email, fax and text communications will include a&#xD;
           confidentiality statement. The minimum amount of identifying information will be&#xD;
           included in all communications. Study forms will include unique study ID numbers only.&#xD;
