  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is investigating if serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use in Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (MCI) patients will lead to a lower rate of progression to dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's hypothesized that patients treated with an SSRI at the time of MCI diagnosis, without&#xD;
      evidence of an active primary psychiatric condition other than neurocognitive disorder, will&#xD;
      have a lower rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia or to other types of&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;

      Whether SSRIs affect the progression of MCI to dementia is not well studied with longitudinal&#xD;
      prospectively collected date. Any decrease in the incidence of the progression of MCI to&#xD;
      Alzheimer's dementia would be beneficial to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is investigating if serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use in Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (MCI) patients will lead to a lower rate of progression to dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective study of prospectively collected longitudinal data in patients&#xD;
      followed at the Cognitive and Memory Disorders Center from 2010-2019. There are 3 arms: (1)&#xD;
      subjects with an initial diagnosis of MCI who were treated with an SSRI for at least one year&#xD;
      prior to the diagnosis of MCI (2) subjects with an initial diagnosis of MCI who were started&#xD;
      on an SSRI at the time of diagnosis and treated with it for at least 6 months after the&#xD;
      diagnosis of MCI and (3) subjects without SSRI use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects have been evaluated based on a comprehensive standardized evaluation for the&#xD;
      initial diagnosis and follow up over time. Chart reviews will be conducted on newly diagnosed&#xD;
      MCI patients from 2010-2016 who have at least 2 years of annual follow up documented in their&#xD;
      electronic medical record. Follow up visit notes through 2019 will be included in the review.&#xD;
