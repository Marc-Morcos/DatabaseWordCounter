  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study BP41192 is a randomized, adaptive, placebo-controlled parallel group study to&#xD;
      investigate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) doses of RO7126209 in healthy participants. RO7126209 is being developed for&#xD;
      the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a parallel group design, with participants recruited in 5 planned sequential&#xD;
      cohorts. Additional cohort(s) may be added if dose escalation stopping criteria are not met&#xD;
      after cohort 5. Participants will receive a single IV dose of either RO7126209 or placebo.&#xD;
      RO7126209 doses will be administered in ascending order. After the starting dose, subsequent&#xD;
      doses will be selected in an adaptive manner during study conduct based on emerging safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and PK data.&#xD;

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory values or abnormal clinical test results), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as Adverse Events.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory values or abnormal clinical test results), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as Adverse Events.</description>
