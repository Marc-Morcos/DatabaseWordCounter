  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common course of cognitive decline and thereby the course&#xD;
      of more than half of all cases of dementia. A proper AD diagnosis is rested on a number of&#xD;
      examinations and tests, which combined can make AD diagnosis likely. But no single test or&#xD;
      examination can unambiguous determine whether the patient has AD or not. Comparatively no&#xD;
      examination or test can with accuracy predict whether a healthy person or a person with only&#xD;
      mild cognitive (MCI)impairment in time will evolve AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEG), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, linear CT&#xD;
      analyses and Timed Up and Go - Dual Task (TUG-DT) are relatively inexpensive and and widely&#xD;
      available diagnostic methods, which have the potential to diagnose AD at an early stage in a&#xD;
      reliable accurate way. But they also have the potential to predict which patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with MCI have particular risk of developing dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the relations between qEEG, CSF biomarkers, CT&#xD;
      analyses and TUG-DT outcome and clinical features in healthy persons as well as patients with&#xD;
      MCI and AD Furthermore to investigate whether qEEG or CSF biomarkers can predict which&#xD;
      patients with MCI will in time evolve AD.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure is progression of clinical symptoms to an extent where the formal NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for dementia is meet. The progression is based upon clinical symptoms as well as explorative determinants in form of clinical tests, CSF analysis and qEEG analysis.</description>
