    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 2, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to investigate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Deferiprone in participants with Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease (pAD)&#xD;
      and Mild Alzheimer's Disease (mAD). In this phase 2 study, the investigators aim to determine&#xD;
      whether Deferiprone (15 mg/kg BID orally) slows cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients. As&#xD;
      secondary outcomes, safety and iron levels in the brain will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II study is designed as a randomised, double-blinded, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      multi-centre study for subjects with evidence of amyloid positive pAD or mAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned randomly to two groups (Group 1 Deferiprone (15mg/kg BID&#xD;
      orally), Group 2: Placebo). Participants will have a 2 in 3 chance to be placed in the&#xD;
      Deferiprone group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enrol approximately 171 participants over 4 sites in Australia. The overall&#xD;
      duration for patients will be 54 weeks. This includes a 55-day screening period, and visits&#xD;
      on Day 1, weeks 13, 26, 38,52, and a two-week follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened for the study after signing the approved informed consent form.&#xD;
      As part of the 55-day screening phase, subjects will undertake an extensive medical and&#xD;
      neurological assessments as well as a PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, following the screening phase, blood and urine will be taken for&#xD;
      safety monitoring and for measuring APOE-4 gene status. Baseline signs and symptoms will be&#xD;
      collected. An MRI will be performed All patients will start with study medication at the&#xD;
      Baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the centre on Weeks 13, 26, 38, 52 (or early termination) to&#xD;
      undertake a neurological examination as well as an assessment of blood samples taken at the&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must also attend weekly blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAE's, AE's and changes to concomitant medications will be observed and evaluated throughout&#xD;
      the study. Each study visit will have a 7-day window after the due date to account for&#xD;
      scheduling conflicts/holidays/weekends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given additional study product to account for the 7-day window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must attend the weekly pathology visits with a 3-day window of the scheduled&#xD;
      date or risk termination from the trial.&#xD;
