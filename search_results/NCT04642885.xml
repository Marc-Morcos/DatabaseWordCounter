      Using a combination of paper or online surveys in addition to interactive visits with blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring, participants are observed interacting with each other. Blood pressure&#xD;
      devices are mailed to their homes and only worn for six minute intervals. The first visit&#xD;
      generally lasts one hour and the second visit 90 minutes.&#xD;

    <measure>Caregiver demand appraisals</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one year</time_frame>
    <description>(1a) Caregiver demand appraisals: 6 items from the 12-item Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) will assess caregiver appraisals of demands (e.g., That because of the time you spend with your relative that you don't have enough time for yourself?&quot;. Caregivers self-report aspects of burden on a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (nearly always; α= .86). Higher numbers indicate higher demands. Administration is 2.5 minutes</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one year later</time_frame>
    <description>(1b) Caregiver perceived stress: 6 items from the 12-item Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) will assess caregiver perceived stress (e.g., &quot;Stressed between caring for your relative and trying to meet other responsibilities (work/family)?&quot;). Caregivers self-report aspects of burden on a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (nearly always; α= .86). Higher numbers indicate higher stress. Administration is 2.5 minutes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver negative Coping</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one year later</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief COPE Inventory is a shortened version (28 items) of the COPE inventory in which respondents indicate how often they use a particular coping strategy under stress as ranked on a 4-point scale with 1 (I haven't been doing this at all) to 4 (I've been doing this a lot). Examples of items include &quot;I've been using alcohol or drugs to help me get through it.&quot; and &quot;I've been criticizing myself&quot; (α=0.72, 0.84, 0.75 for emotion, problem, and dysfunction focused subscales). Higher scores indicate poorer coping. Administration is 10 minutes</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relational Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one year later</time_frame>
    <description>The Relationships Inventory will measure the degree to which individuals perceive that they can rely on their parent or child for help and support when needed (e.g., &quot;to what extent can you count on your parent/child for help with a problem?&quot; &quot;to what extent can you count on your parent/child to give you honest feedback, even when you might not want to hear it?&quot;). Ratings will be made on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much; α=.79). Four additional items will assess the degree to which individuals perceive that their parent/child is a good support-provider (e.g., &quot;overall, my parent/child is a good support-provider&quot; using a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Higher numbers indicate higher relationship functioning. Administration is 5 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Health</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one year later</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be assessed using the 12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12) version 1.0, documenting the extent of limitations in a number of domains. Higher scores indicate better physical and mental health-related quality of life. It has been used with both persons with ADRD and caregivers. Administration is 5 minutes. The minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 100.</description>
