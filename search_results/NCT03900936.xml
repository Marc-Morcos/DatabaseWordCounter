      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether the 4 Mountains test of allocentric (i.e. viewpoint-independent)&#xD;
           spatial memory, and tests of memory for a recent experience (e.g. watching a brief&#xD;
           video), to diagnose the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We operationalise this as the ability of these tests to predict whether or not an&#xD;
           individual progresses from having some cognitive difficulties (diagnosed as 'mild&#xD;
           cognitive impairment' MCI) to subsequently developing Alzheimer's disease up to two&#xD;
           years later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess whether the ability to diagnose early stages of Alzheimer's disease can be&#xD;
           improved by combining the scores from different memory tests, from questionnaires&#xD;
           assessing spatial and social aspects of everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess whether scores on the spatial memory test are correlated with patients'&#xD;
           reports of their everyday spatial memory, using a newly-developed questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the ability of allocentric spatial and episodic memory test performance to&#xD;
      predict progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess to what extent social characteristics of everyday life may impact upon&#xD;
           progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To correlate allocentric spatial test performance with real-world spatial ability as&#xD;
           assessed through a novel spatial questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the need for tests that reliably diagnose the early stages of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD) with high accuracy has been strongly emphasised. Detecting AD in its earliest&#xD;
      stages increases the likelihood that therapeutic agents (e.g. newly-developed drugs) and&#xD;
      interventions (e.g. changes in diet and exercise) can prolong the period of high-quality,&#xD;
      independent living and reduce the impact on patients, families and care providers. An ideal&#xD;
      test would have the sensitivity to detect everyone who has early-stage AD, while&#xD;
      simultaneously not giving a 'false alarm' to anyone who shows some age-related impairments in&#xD;
      cognition but who does not have early-stage AD. Secondly, an ideal test should be free and&#xD;
      simple to administer on a national scale, without requiring extensive training on the part of&#xD;
      the testers to set up, run, and interpret. Unfortunately, currently used tests do not come&#xD;
      close to this ideal. There are some good biomarker-based tests for early stages of AD, but&#xD;
      they are costly, highly invasive and in effect impossible to use for national screening&#xD;
      purposes. MRI imaging of brain regions affected early in AD detects early AD no better than&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing and whilst it is non-invasive, many patients find it aversive.&#xD;
      Here, we propose to examine whether the use of spatial and episodic memory tests can get us&#xD;
      nearer to this ideal, whether used singly, together, or in combination with other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has two stages. In stage 1, we will administer recently-developed spatial and&#xD;
      episodic memory tests (along with more established neuropsychological tests) to patients who&#xD;
      have recently been diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). At stage 2, clinical&#xD;
      follow up (c.15-30 months after MCI diagnosis) we will establish those patients who have, and&#xD;
      have not, progressed to AD. Analysis will then determine which tests at stage 1 best&#xD;
      predicted progression-to-AD at stage 2.&#xD;

        Participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will be recruited from memory clinics&#xD;
        from several different trusts, including NHS South Tees NHS FT and NHS Tees, Esk and Wear&#xD;
        Valleys NHS FT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnosis of MCI will be made by clinicians in accordance with the four core clinical&#xD;
        criteria of Albert et al (2011). Briefly, these are: 1) Evidence of change (worsening) in&#xD;
        cognition; 2) Impairment in one or more cognitive domains greater than expected for&#xD;
        age/education; 3) Preservation of independence in functional abilities; 4) No current&#xD;
        dementia.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  1. Presence of significant neurological condition such as Traumatic Brain Injury,&#xD;
             Epilepsy, Stroke, Multiple Sclerosis, Brain tumour, Encephalitis, Meningitis,&#xD;
             Parkinson's disease or visual impairment severe enough to hamper processing of visual&#xD;
             test stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Major psychiatric disorder, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and personality&#xD;
             disorders such as borderline personality disorder. We will exclude severe (but not&#xD;
             mild or moderate) clinical depression, and will exclude severe (but not mild or&#xD;
             moderate) anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The use of cognitive enhancing drugs e.g. Cholinesterase inhibitors. 4. A history&#xD;
             of alcohol excess or excess of illicit drug use within the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (By definition, the diagnosis of dementia excludes a participant, since this would conflict&#xD;
        with the fourth basis for the MCI diagnosis)&#xD;
