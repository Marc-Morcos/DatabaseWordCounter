      The purpose of this study is to test the psychoeducational program &quot;Tele-Savvy.&quot; Tele-Savvy&#xD;
      is an internet based, group education program developed from an in person program called&#xD;
      Savvy Caregiver. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Tele-Savvy group&#xD;
      (receiving only the Tele-Savvy education) or the Healthy Living Education Program (receiving&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle education and then Tele-Savvy education 6 months later) or a usual care&#xD;
      group (receiving Tele-Savvy education 6 months later). Each program takes 43 days to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses the reliance on family members to provide virtually all community-based&#xD;
      care for 5.3 million persons living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, a&#xD;
      population that will likely triple in the next 35 years. Unless researchers soon find a way&#xD;
      to prevent and cure dementing illnesses like Alzheimer's, the country will continue to face&#xD;
      an urgent need to find ways to sustain and bolster the capacity of these family caregivers to&#xD;
      manage the multiple daily care challenges they face and to preserve their well-being while&#xD;
      doing so. Without family caregivers, the burden of care could well overwhelm the formal&#xD;
      components of our care system. A number of psychoeducation programs for caregivers have been&#xD;
      effective in relieving distress, increasing self-efficacy, managing caregiving challenges,&#xD;
      and enabling caregivers to sustain care over longer periods of time. However, many&#xD;
      Alzheimer's caregivers cannot take part in these programs because virtually all such programs&#xD;
      require caregivers to arrange care for the care recipient while the caregivers attend the&#xD;
      programs. These are obstacles in rural or remote areas where transportation issues further&#xD;
      restrict caregivers' already limited access to caregiver programs, but they are no less a&#xD;
      problem in inner cities and suburbs. These obstacles highlight a substantial challenge to our&#xD;
      ability to rely on caregivers as a continuing care resource for persons living with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease: there is a need for theory-driven psychoeducation programs that can be&#xD;
      made readily available to caregivers who may not be able to attend in-person programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized trial to test a program designed to meet this critical need. This study&#xD;
      will test Tele-Savvy, an internet-based program based on the widely disseminated, in-person&#xD;
      Savvy Caregiver psychoeducation program. Delivered in scheduled videoconferences and&#xD;
      independently viewed on-line video lessons, Tele-Savvy aims to develop/enhance caregivers'&#xD;
      skills and caregiving mastery, reduce adverse effects of caregiving, and improve the quality&#xD;
      of the lives of caregivers and care recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers will be randomly assigned either to immediate Tele-Savvy participation groups or&#xD;
      to attention control or usual care groups that are invited to participate in Tele-Savvy six&#xD;
      months after baseline data collection. Each program takes 43 days to complete. In those 43&#xD;
      days, participants will be asked to take part in a video conference once per week (60-90&#xD;
      minutes) and view daily video lessons (7-15 minutes). The study includes 5 interviews over&#xD;
      the course of the 12 month study; the interviews at baseline and months 3 and 6 assess the&#xD;
      study outcome measures. These interviews will discuss participant's experience as a&#xD;
      caregiver. All interviews will be limited to 60 minutes.&#xD;

    <measure>Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The ZBI is a 22 item scale. Each item on the interview is a statement which the caregiver is asked to endorse using a 5-point scale. Response options range from 0 (Never) to 4 (Nearly Always). Total scores range from 0 (low burden) to 88 (high burden)</description>

    <description>The STAI State (STAI-S) is a 20-item 4-point Likert scale commonly used measure of state anxiety. Respondents report the intensity of their anxiety at that moment on a 4-point scale where 1 = not at all and 4 = very much so. Total scores range from 20 to 80 and higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMBPC) Reaction Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The RMBPC is a 24-item instrument that assesses behaviors in persons with dementia and caregiver responses to them. Caregiver reactions to behaviors are scored as 0 = not at all upsetting to 4 = extremely upsetting. Total caregiver reaction scores range from 0 to 96 with higher scores indicating greater feelings of being upset by behaviors of those with dementia that they are providing care for.</description>

    <description>The Caregiving Competence Subscale of the Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence instrument has 4 items that are responded to on a 4-point Likert scale where 1 = not at all and 4 = very much. Total scores for this subscale range from 4 to 16 and higher scores indicate greater feelings of competence with caregiving.</description>

    <description>The Tele-Savvy program engages groups of six dementia family caregivers in a program that extends over 43 days. The program begins with a scheduled 75-minute group videoconference led by facilitators; similar group videoconferences then take place weekly for six weeks. In between the video-conferences, caregivers will receive daily emails with links to 5-15 minute on-line video lessons that can be watched on their own schedule as often as they wish. The videoconferences allow caregivers to report enactment of learned and self-developed management strategy behaviors into their own caregiving and allow them to raise questions. Each daily video presents a teaching point linked to the overall curriculum. The lesson is carried forward by brief, scripted talks by experts or is enacted in vignettes in which a fictional family caring for a father living with Alzheimer's demonstrates effective caregiving techniques linked to the day's teaching points.</description>

        <description>The STAI State (STAI-S) is a 20-item 4-point Likert scale commonly used measure of state anxiety. Respondents report the intensity of their anxiety at that moment on a 4-point scale where 1 = not at all and 4 = very much so. Total scores range from 20 to 80 and higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>

        <population>This analysis includes participants completing the indicated study visit, who also had valid data for this assessment. One questionnaire had missing or skipped items resulting in one participant being removed from the analysis.</population>

          <title>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) Score</title>
          <description>The PSS is 14-item Likert-type questionnaire. Responses are given on a 5-point scale where 0 = never and 4 = very often. Total scores range from 0 to 56 and certain items are reverse scored so that higher total scores reflect higher perceived stress.</description>
          <population>This analysis includes participants completing the indicated study visit, who also had valid data for this assessment. Some questionnaires had missing or skipped items resulting in removing those participants from the analysis.</population>
