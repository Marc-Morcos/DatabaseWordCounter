      This is an open label extension study for participants with AD who have completed Protocol&#xD;
      TB006AD2102 (lead-in study) or participants who would have been eligible for the lead-in&#xD;
      study but were not enrolled (de novo). This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK,&#xD;
      and PD of TB006. The total study duration for each participant will be up to 113 weeks [This&#xD;
      includes 101 weeks (2 years) of dosing and a 12-week safety follow-up period]. The number of&#xD;
      participants enrolled from the lead-in study will be 100 to 120 and additionally, up to 50 de&#xD;
      novo participants, identified by the sponsor, may be included. A total of approximately 150&#xD;

    <description>The C-SSRS is a suicidal ideation and behavior rating scale with yes/no responses. For each of the 5 items of the C-SSRS related to suicidal ideation intensity, an individual's degree of suicidal ideation is rated on a 0-5 scale with 0: no suicidal behavior and 5: active suicidal ideation. The total score is the sum of the 5 intensity item scores (total score ranges from 0 to 25). Higher scores in the scale indicate greater disease severity.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR SB) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 101</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR scale is a clinician-rated dementia staging system that tracks the progression of cognitive impairment in 6 categories (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care). Each category is scored on a 5-point scale in which None = 0, Questionable = 0.5, Mild = 1, Moderate = 2, and Severe = 3. The global CDR score is established by clinical scoring rules and has values of 0 (no dementia), 0.5, (questionable dementia), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), and 3 (severe dementia). The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) is obtained by adding the ratings in each of the 6 categories and ranges from 0 to 18 with higher scores indicative of greater impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in cognitive functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 101</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive functioning will be measured by Cognitive Drug Research system (CDR) Computerized Assessment system. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention, working memory, episodic memory, and executive function. It contains 11 tests and is performed on a tablet-like device. Participants respond via 'Yes (1)' and 'No (0)' buttons on a two-button response box. The minimum possible score is 0 and maximum possible score is 11. Higher score indicates better cognitive function</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 101</time_frame>
    <description>Global cognitive functioning is measured by MMSE. MMSE is a neuropsychological test for the evaluation of intellectual efficiency disorders and the presence of cognitive impairment. The total score is between a minimum of 0 (worse cognitive function) and a maximum of 30 points (normal cognitive function). A lower score indicates severe impairment of cognitive abilities and a higher score indicates cognitive normality.</description>

    <description>The NPI is a condition-specific measure designed to assess 12 behavioral disturbances, namely delusions, hallucinations, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, agitation/aggression, elation/euphoria, disinhibition, irritability/lability, apathy, aberrant motor activity, night-time behavior disturbances, and appetite/eating abnormalities. The frequency is scored from 0 (never) to 4 (very frequently) and severity ranges between 0 (none) to 3 (marked). The domain score is obtained by multiplying frequency and severity scores. The total NPI score is the sum total of all individual domain scores (0-144). A higher score indicates abnormal behaviour.</description>

    <description>EuroQol 5 is a self-reported description of participant's current health in 5 dimensions i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Participants to grade their own current level of function in each dimension into one of three degrees of disability (severe, moderate or none). Score ranges between 1 (no problem) and 3 (significant problem). higher scores indicating higher health utility. The total score is the sum total of all individual domain scores (5-15). Higher scores indicates poor quality of life.</description>
