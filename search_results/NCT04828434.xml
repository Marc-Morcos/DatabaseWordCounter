  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to COVID-19, the routine treatment for dementia, Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST), is&#xD;
      currently suspended in multiple countries. Access to treatment is, therefore, paramount. The&#xD;
      investigators seek to bridge the current treatment gap with a virtual and individual form of&#xD;
      CST, called Virtual Individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (V-iCST). This psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention was adapted from the key principles of CST and developed within the Medical&#xD;
      Research Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions. The investigators aim to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of V-iCST in a Randomized Controlled Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) for Virtual Individual Cognitive&#xD;
      Stimulation Therapy (V-iCST), an evidence-based teletherapy for people with mild to moderate&#xD;
      dementia. This psychosocial intervention is adapted from a routine and established dementia&#xD;
      treatment, Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, and developed within the Medical Research Council&#xD;
      (MRC) framework for complex interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia, a global epidemic, affects 50 million individuals worldwide. Cognitive Stimulation&#xD;
      Therapy (CST) is the only non-pharmacological therapy recommended by the UK government to&#xD;
      improve cognition for mild to moderate dementia. It is delivered in over 85% of National&#xD;
      Health Services (NHS) services and is offered in 34 countries. Unfortunately, this routine&#xD;
      treatment is suspended due to lockdown, even though people with dementia are&#xD;
      disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Accessible treatment is a pressing need. Virtual&#xD;
      Individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (V-iCST) aims to bridge this treatment gap as an&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment for dementia, developed within the Medical Research Council (MRC)&#xD;
      Framework for complex interventions using principles of CST. There may still be a demand for&#xD;
      V-iCST post-pandemic because those with sensory impairments and lack of transport provision&#xD;
      may prefer a virtual and individual treatment. The investigators aim to 1) design V-iCST; 2)&#xD;
      evaluate V-iCST in a feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). A sample of 34&#xD;
      participants will be recruited. Seventeen will be allocated to V-iCST, and 17 to treatment as&#xD;
      usual (TAU), the control group. Data will be collected pre-and post-test. Dementia prevalence&#xD;
      is projected to reach 152 million worldwide by 2050. Therefore, accessible treatment is&#xD;
      paramount during the pandemic and beyond.&#xD;

    <description>Exploratory outcome; measured pre-and post-intervention with Montreal Cognitive Assessment Blind Version (MoCA-BLIND) (Wittich et al., 2010). MoCA - BLIND is a short version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment designed for the visually impaired. It consists of 6 items with scores from 0 to 22, where a low score indicates poor performance.</description>

    <description>Virtual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (V-iCST), a psychosocial intervention, is a modified version of CST for people with mild to moderate dementia. Like the original CST, each of the 14 sessions will begin with a &quot;warm-up activity,&quot; which includes an orientation task and discussion of current affairs, followed by a main activity.&#xD;
V-iCST will be prescribed to participants twice a week, for 7 weeks and each session is approx. 45 minutes. The intervention will be delivered by trained professionals, such as research staff, psychologists, and trainee clinical psychologists. All facilitators will have experience in dementia care and will have completed the CST training.</description>
