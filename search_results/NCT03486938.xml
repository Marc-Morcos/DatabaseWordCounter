  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of AGB101 on slowing cognitive&#xD;
      and functional impairment as measured by changes in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes&#xD;
      (CDR-SB) score as compared with placebo in participants with mild cognitive impairment due to&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease (MCI due to AD) also known as prodromal AD. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive placebo or AGB101 (220 mg), once daily for 78 weeks. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to assess the effect of AGB101 compared with placebo on clinical progression&#xD;
      as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Functional Activities Questionnaire&#xD;
      (FAQ).&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Permitted medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. With potential pro-cognitive effects, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and&#xD;
                  memantine, must be at a stable dose for ≥3 months prior to screening and remain&#xD;

&#xD;
                  The Florbetaben scan performed at baseline must be read by a qualified physician&#xD;
                  with experience in reading amyloid PET scans, and it should be consistent with&#xD;
                  the presence of amyloid plaques.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Repeated MRI scans (3 Tesla) with no contraindications to MRI. MRI scan results&#xD;
                  are consistent with the diagnosis of amnestic MCI due to Alzheimer's disease with&#xD;
                  no clinically significant findings of non-AD pathology that could account for the&#xD;
                  observed cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing to allow collection of blood for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Participation in a therapeutic clinical study for any medical or psychiatric&#xD;
             indications within 3 months (6 months for biologics) of the screening visit, or at any&#xD;
             time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects must understand that they may only enroll in this clinical study once; they&#xD;
             may not enroll in any other clinical study while participating in the current study,&#xD;
             and they may not participate in a clinical study of a drug, biologic, therapeutic&#xD;
             device, or medical food, in which the last dose/administration was received within 3&#xD;
             months (6 months for biologics) prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of hypersensitivity or lack of tolerability to AGB101 (levetiracetam)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of &lt;30 mL/minute) or undergoing&#xD;
             hemodialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any significant neurological disease other than suspected incipient AD, such as&#xD;
             Parkinson's disease, multi-infarct dementia, Huntington's disease, normal pressure&#xD;
             hydrocephalus, brain tumor, progressive supranuclear palsy, seizure disorder (lifetime&#xD;
             history; infant febrile seizures are not exclusionary), subdural hematoma, multiple&#xD;
             sclerosis, or history of significant head trauma followed by persistent neurologic&#xD;
             deficits, or known structural brain abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence of pacemakers, aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ear implants, metal&#xD;
             fragments, or foreign objects in the eyes, skin, or body&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Diagnosis of major depression or bipolar disorder, as described in the Diagnostic and&#xD;
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Ed (DSM-5), within the past 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Psychotic features, agitation, or behavioral problems within the last 3 months that&#xD;
             could lead to difficulty complying with the protocol. Subjects must not have a major&#xD;
             depressive disorder or other types of depression that could confound diagnosis of MCI&#xD;
             due to AD, or clinical assessments, in the opinion of the investigator. The geriatric&#xD;
             depression scale (long form score &gt;9 suggests depression) results should be reviewed&#xD;
             by the investigator to assist in this determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale (HIS) score &gt;4&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of schizophrenia (DSM-5 criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence within the past 3 years (DSM-5&#xD;
             criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any significant systemic illness or unstable medical condition that could lead to&#xD;
             difficulty in complying with the protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Clinically significant abnormalities in B12 or thyroid function test that might&#xD;
             interfere with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A low B12 (below normative range for elderly) is exclusionary, unless follow-up labs&#xD;
             (homocysteine and methylmalonic acid) indicate that it is not physiologically&#xD;
             significant. If the B12 deficiency is treated, subjects may become eligible to&#xD;
             participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Residence in a skilled nursing facility. Individuals in independent living&#xD;
             communities, assisted living facilities, residential care facilities, or continuing&#xD;
             care communities are eligible provided they engage in a sufficient spectrum of&#xD;
             activity to permit assessment of all 6 domains contributing to the CDR-SB. Individuals&#xD;
             in these facilities must also have a caregiver who has the ability to observe the&#xD;
             subject during the study and can participate in clinical evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any use of excluded medications (e.g., antiepileptics, certain antidepressants or&#xD;
             antipsychotics, antihistamines with anticholinergic properties, opiates)&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Participation in clinical studies using the ISLT, Behavioral Pattern Separation&#xD;
             (BPS-O) task, or the trail making test (A, B) within 1 month of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Female subjects must not be pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential (i.e.,&#xD;
             they must be 2 years post menopause or surgically sterile)&#xD;
