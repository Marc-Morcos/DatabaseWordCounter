    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect and process of individualized music therapy for home-dwelling&#xD;
      persons with mild to moderate dementia. The music therapy is administered individually and&#xD;
      includes a close caregiver. Memory of familiar music is found to be retained in persons with&#xD;
      dementia. It is assumed to facilitate autobiographical memories and stimulate interaction&#xD;
      with significant others. Based on time series analyses we will use statistical process&#xD;
      control to evaluate when and how change occur.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is often followed by complicating symptoms such as anxiety, depression, agitation,&#xD;
      hallucination and sleep disorders. The progression of dementia can threaten the relationship&#xD;
      between the person with dementia (PWD) and their relatives. One reason is the possible loss&#xD;
      of reciprocity and a mutual supportive relationship. This may influence the quality of life&#xD;
      in both the PWD and their relatives and increase the caregiver-burden. The music therapy in&#xD;
      this intervention is focusing on increasing positive emotions, increasing reciprocity and&#xD;
      stimulating communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1st, 5th and 10th music therapy-session is video-recorded. The first 5 recorded minutes&#xD;
      before the sessions will provide a baseline of the observed primary outcomes throughout the&#xD;
      session. Videos are analyzed to examine changes in social communication behavior and&#xD;
      emotional well-being. Time-series analysis of the observations will be conducted, enabling us&#xD;
      to evaluate potential effects of the therapeutic interventions and to find out when, why and&#xD;
      to what extent changes unfold in real time. The pre-post measures are secondary. The project&#xD;
      is a merging and further development of two recent music therapy designs. (Articles cited in&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in social interaction behavior throughout the music therapy session compared to baseline(Verbal and Nonverbal Interaction Scale (VNVIS))</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (the first 5 videorecorded minutes before the music therapy) up to 45 minutes with music therapy intervention. The 1st, 5th and 10th session is videorecorded. Observation-interval is 30 seconds.</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal and nonverbal interaction scale(VNVIS) is a standardized observational instrument for assessing prosocial and nonsocial verbal and nonverbal communication behavior between a person with dementia and their close caregiver. The scale is measuring both prosocial and nonsocial behavior, 26 items, 13 pr subscale. The person can score from 0-13 points on prosocial items pr timepoint, higher score indicates more prosocial behavior is present. The same holds for nonsocial behavior, the higher score indicates more nonsocial behavior observed.</description>

    <measure>Observable signs of well being (OSWDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (the first 5 videorecorded minutes before the music therapy) up to 45 minutes with music therapy intervention. The 1st, 5th and 10th session is videorecorded. Observation-interval is 30 seconds.</time_frame>
    <description>The observable signs of wellbeing in dementia- scale (OSWDS) is a scale for proxy-rated well being in persons with dementia. The scale is under development, and is tested during the intervention. It consists of 10 items measuring from 0-10 points. Each item is rated as present or non-present during the time interval. Higher score indicates higher levels of observed wellbeing.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self reported mood before and after the music therapy session (Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS))</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment before and after every music therapy session (10 weeks) and before and after every musical activity with the relative (10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>VAMS is a standardized visual analogue scale tailored to persons with cognitive impairment measuring 8 self reported mood states. Each state is scored by marking on a 10 cm line by the person with dementia. The score is calculated by measuring the point on the line in mm, and the range is 0-100, were 100 indicates maximum emotional experience.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-treatment (up to two weeks after the intervention period)</time_frame>
    <description>NPI-Q is a standardized measure of common neuropsychiatric symptoms following dementia. The scale consists of 12 items rated from 0-3. Items are summed, and the range is 0-36. Higher score means more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of life in Alzheimer Dementia (QoL-AD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-treatment (up to two weeks after the intervention period)</time_frame>
    <description>QoL-AD is a standardized interview designed to measure items concerning the experienced quality of life in persons with dementia. The scale consists of 15 items from 1-4. The items are summed, and the range is 15-60. Higher score means higher self-reported quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Relative Stress Scale (RSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-treatment (up to two weeks after the intervention period)</time_frame>
    <description>RSS is a standardized measure of self-reported caregiver burden in carers of PWD. 15 items are scored from 0-4, giving a range from 0-60. A higher score indicates more severe stress for the caregiver.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Music in Dementia Assessment Scales (MiDAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after every music therapy session (10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>MiDAS is a standardized music therapy outcome scale measuring clinical response to the intervention. The scale consists of 5 items on a visual analogue scale, and the music therapist score the items for the 5 first minutes and for the 5 most significant minutes in the session. Each item has a range from 0-100, were a higher score means a higher level of involvement in the music therapy. The 5 items are reviewed separately.</description>
