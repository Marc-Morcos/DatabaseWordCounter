    <textblock>
      In its long preclinical course, AD shows a spreading pattern of specific pathology in a&#xD;
      uniform sequence of predictable steps including brainstem nuclei in early stages. Many of&#xD;
      these nuclei which are early involved in AD take equally part in the afferences of the Xth&#xD;
      cranial nerve, the Vagus nerve. A method for the functional assessment of Vagus-related&#xD;
      nuclei in the lower brainstem is the technique of somatosensory evoked potentials of the&#xD;
      Vagus nerve (VSEP). This method targets the accessibility of early functional changes by&#xD;
      evoked potentials on one hand and the early affection of specific brainstem nuclei comprising&#xD;
      Vagus afferences in the course of AD on the other hand. The method of VSEP takes advantage of&#xD;
      the transcutaneous stimulation of the auricular branch of the Vagus nerve (ABVN) which is&#xD;
      presumed to be the only sensory part of this nerve innervating parts of the outer meatus&#xD;
      acoustics at the tragus. This cutaneous branch was shown to gain access to Vagus afferences&#xD;
      via brainstem regions which are affected in the course of AD. VSEP latencies in AD were shown&#xD;
      to be significantly longer as compared to healthy controls. Yet, if VSEP really are suited&#xD;
      for the early detection of AD is still not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measures changes in cerebral oxygenation by&#xD;
      means of near-infrared light using wavelengths of 650-850 nm. The principle of fNIRS is based&#xD;
      on the principle that regional neuronal activation of the brain leads to an increase in&#xD;
      metabolism and oxygenation of brain tissue in that region which is accompanied by an elevated&#xD;
      regional cerebral blood flow. In AD, there is a growing body of literature reporting deviant&#xD;
      fNIRS activation patterns for a variety of tasks. For example, it was shown that the fNIRS&#xD;
      activation pattern in frontal and parietal cortex areas in subjects with AD performing the&#xD;
      line orientation paradigm is clearly different from healthy controls. Yet, if fNIRS is suited&#xD;
      as a means of early detection of AD is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore we aimed at testing the predictive value of VSEP and fNIRS in the early detection&#xD;
      of AD. The hypothesis to be tested within this study states that subjects developing AD or&#xD;
      MCI within an observation period of 6 years depict longer VSEP latencies, a different fNIRS&#xD;
      oxygenation pattern and a lower performance in neuropsychologic rating below the level of&#xD;
      dementia at baseline than those who remain cognitively stable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the increasing life span of our population, the prevalence of dementia syndromes is&#xD;
      increasing. The most frequent cause of dementia is Alzheimer´s disease (AD), and still, it is&#xD;
      not curable. Thus, AD is of increasing medical, social and economic importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive scientific work within the past 30 years has identified a range of different&#xD;
      factors contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. These complex processes result in specific&#xD;
      therapeutic options which are currently investigated in clinical trials. Regardless of the&#xD;
      considered risk factor or the specific therapeutic intervention, treatment should be started&#xD;
      as early in the excessive preclinical process of AD as possible since it can interfere with&#xD;
      the formation of amyloid plaques or neurofibrils. Especially neuroprotective interventions&#xD;
      are more effective the less neurons are irreversibly damaged.Therefore, an early diagnosis of&#xD;
      developing or incipient AD should be of utmost importance. Likewise, in the light of&#xD;
      therapeutic options specific for AD, its differential diagnosis from other forms of dementia&#xD;
      seems important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, an ideal examination method should not only be easy to conduct, cost effective,&#xD;
      repeatable, non-invasive and without discomfort for patients, but it should in particular&#xD;
      detect early stages of disease and it should, if possible, consider the development of&#xD;
      AD-specific changes. Obviously, today´s routine examination methods in the diagnosis of AD or&#xD;
      MCI such as magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis or positron emission&#xD;
      tomography do not fulfil all of these requirements. Thus, in the absence of a single&#xD;
      diagnostic test and realizing the necessity to combine biomarkers to increase the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy there is still need for methods that circumvent all those disadvantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since early cellular changes of the disease are expected to impact brain function long before&#xD;
      severe morphological alterations occur, these changes should primarily be investigated using&#xD;
      functional examination which can be conducted with neurocognitive methods such as intensive&#xD;
      neuropsychological rating or with electrophysiological or functional brain imaging methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological rating Prior studies investigated the predictive validity of different&#xD;
      cognitive measures for the development of AD such as associative learning, verbal fluency and&#xD;
      constructive praxis. As such, verbal and non-verbal memory, visual-spatial and executive&#xD;
      functions and verbal fluency with executive component seem to be suited for following the&#xD;
      deterioration of cognition. In subjects who later develop AD or MCI as compared to a healthy&#xD;
      controls, worse performance in episodic memory according (Delayed Verbal and Visual Memory&#xD;
      und Associative Learning) and in semantic verbal fluency are known to be characteristic. An&#xD;
      extended neuropsychologic testing to measure these cognitive processes thus seems reasonable&#xD;
      in particular to evaluate the additional benefit of other diagnostic methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vagus somatosensory evoked potentials (VSEP) As we know today, AD has a long preclinical&#xD;
      course with a spreading pattern of specific AD pathology such as neurofibrillary tangles in a&#xD;
      uniform sequence of predictable steps. Many of these nuclei which are early involved in AD&#xD;
      like the Locus caeruleus, parabrachial nucleus or Raphe nuclei take equally part in the&#xD;
      afferences of the Xth cranial nerve, the Vagus nerve. Our laboratory used a hypothesis-driven&#xD;
      approach to develop a method for the functional assessment of Vagus-related nuclei in the&#xD;
      lower brainstem which resulted in the technique of somatosensory evoked potentials of the&#xD;
      Vagus nerve (VSEP). This method targets the accessibility of early functional changes by&#xD;
      evoked potentials on one hand and the early affection of specific brainstem nuclei comprising&#xD;
      Vagus afferences in the course of AD on the other hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of VSEP takes advantage of the transcutaneous stimulation of the auricular branch&#xD;
      of the Vagus nerve (ABVN). It is presumed to be the only sensory part of this nerve&#xD;
      innervating parts of the outer meatus acoustics at the tragus. This cutaneous branch was&#xD;
      shown to gain access to Vagus afferences via the Solitary tract nucleus which is affected in&#xD;
      the course of AD as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of VSEP meanwhile is well characterized from a methodological point of view.&#xD;
      There are numerous findings suggesting that observed potentials are generated at brainstem&#xD;
      level and can be detected as far field potentials at the scalp without any side effects. VSEP&#xD;
      are reproducible and amplitudes as well as latencies are in the range of corresponding&#xD;
      parameters of acoustic evoked potentials. Detailed examinations with functional magnetic&#xD;
      imaging revealed a cortical activation pattern upon ABVN stimulation comparable to the&#xD;
      activation pattern as response to the conventional invasive stimulation of the main Vagus&#xD;
      branch. In a subsequent work, even involvement of brainstem activation was demonstrated that&#xD;
      could be related to ascending Vagus nerve projections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, VSEP were proposed as a possible means for the early detection of AD and mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI). VSEP latencies in both groups were shown to be significantly&#xD;
      longer as compared to healthy controls. No difference in VSEP parameters was found in&#xD;
      patients with Vascular dementia and Major depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) NIRS measures changes in cerebral oxygenation by means of&#xD;
      near-infrared light using wavelengths of 650-850 nm. The principle of NIRS is based on the&#xD;
      principle of neurovascular coupling stating that regional neuronal activation of the brain&#xD;
      leads to an increase in metabolism and oxygenation of brain tissue in that region which is&#xD;
      accompanied by an elevated regional cerebral blood flow. This in turn leads to an increased&#xD;
      oxygen saturation with elevated concentrations of oxygenated haemoglobin and diminished&#xD;
      concentrations of deoxygenated haemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last years, functional NIRS (fNIRS) was increasingly applied to measure changes in&#xD;
      oxygen saturation of cortical areas during a variety of cognitive tasks such as for example&#xD;
      verbal fluency test and thus to detect specific cortical activation not only in the visual&#xD;
      and the motor system, but also in cortical areas relevant for cognitive tasks such as&#xD;
      prefrontal and parietal cortex that remain stable and are replicable. In AD, there is a&#xD;
      growing body of literature reporting deviant fNIRS activation patterns for a variety of&#xD;
      tasks. For example, young healthy subjects displayed a distinct activation pattern of the&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex during a verbal fluency test (VFT) showing a left hemispheric&#xD;
      lateralization which decreased with age without a decline in behavioural performance. In&#xD;
      contrast, subjects with AD showed a worse behavioural performance and an even more severe&#xD;
      decrease of prefrontal activation as well as a reduced left lateralization as compared to an&#xD;
      age-adjusted healthy control group. Likewise, it was shown that the fNIRS activation pattern&#xD;
      in frontal and parietal cortex areas in subjects with AD performing the line orientation&#xD;
      paradigm is clearly different from healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study To summarize, VSEP, fNIRS and neuropsychological rating are able to&#xD;
      differentiate AD from healthy controls. From a theoretical point of view, these methods&#xD;
      should even be suited as a means of detection of the disease in early phases as well. If they&#xD;
      are really suited as means for that purpose is to be examined in the here presented study.&#xD;
      Therefore we aimed at testing the predictive value of these methods in the early detection of&#xD;
      AD. In the here presented research project, 600 subjects examined at baseline by means of&#xD;
      VSEP, fNIRS and extended neuropsychological, somatic and laboratory examination are to be&#xD;
      reexamined 3 and 6 years later. The hypothesis to be tested within this study states that&#xD;
      subjects developing AD or MCI within the observation period depict longer VSEP latencies, a&#xD;
      different fNIRS oxygenation pattern and a lower performance in neuropsychologic rating below&#xD;
      the level of dementia at baseline than those who remain cognitively stable.&#xD;
