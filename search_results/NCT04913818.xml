    <textblock>
      This project is a pilot study that seeks to develop a novel dyadic BUDPA intervention, using&#xD;
      exercise as the common treatment component to improve the cognitive outcomes of persons with&#xD;
      dementia and manage the stress-related symptoms of their family caregivers. BUDPA has&#xD;
      integrated the concept of developing social capital for dementia management. By applying&#xD;
      partner exercise, the longer-term provider for this therapeutic care will be shifted from&#xD;
      service providers to the family caregivers and the persons with dementia. Helping them to&#xD;
      translate the practice to a home-care setting further strengthens the notions of family&#xD;
      responsibility and ability in dementia management. BUDPA fully engages the care dyads in a&#xD;
      mutual helping relationship during the exercise training. The partner exercise also creates a&#xD;
      platform to enable more meaningful encounter within the care dyad. The family caregivers are&#xD;
      facilitated to find meaning in the caregiving process, which eventually can benefit their&#xD;
      role commitment and mental wellness. Also, the use of mixed-method study design can provide&#xD;
      high quality findings to inform both the feasibility and preliminary effects of the BUDPA&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

Each session starts with a 10-minute warm-up period using stretching exercise and stationary mobilizing exercise for trunk and limb joints at both upper and lower bodies and followed by a session of four to six selected partnering exercise, with duration increase gradually from 20 minutes to 40 minutes in four weeks' time. The Borg Rate of Perceived Exertion (Borg RPE) will be used to monitor the exercise intensity. The research assistant will explain the Borg RPE scale to the subjects and instruct them to speed up or slow down their movements in order to achieve a feeling of 'somewhat hard' at the Borg RPE rating of 12-14. The training session will end with a 10-minute cool down exercise session.</description>

    <description>The overall program includes 12 weekly 1-hour training class. Each session starts with a 10-minute warm-up period using stretching exercise and stationary mobilizing exercise for trunk and limb joints at both upper and lower bodies (e.g. shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees and ankles), and followed by a session of four to six selected partnering exercise, with duration increase gradually from 20 minutes to 40minutes in four weeks' time. The Borg Rate of Perceived Exertion (Borg RPE) will be used to monitor the exercise intensity. The Research assistant will explain the Borg RPE scale to the subjects and instruct them to speed up or slow down their movements. The training session will end with a 10-minute cool down session with walking exercise and stationary trunk and limb mobilizing exercise involving joints of shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.</description>
