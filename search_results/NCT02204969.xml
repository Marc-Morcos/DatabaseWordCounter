      The thermal therapy combined with magnetic fields and ozone has a direct effect on patients&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and cognitive deteriorating in the&#xD;
      advanced age. This main target of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using novel coil design (H2) for stimulation of deep&#xD;
      brain structures concomitantly with regular treatment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.&#xD;
      TMS acts by generating magnetic fields in the brain which simulate neuro-chemical changes and&#xD;
      stimulate neuronal activity translating into increased secretion of growth factors such as&#xD;
      brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). Hence it is postulated that TMS will have a positive&#xD;
      effect on the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of patients with AD and may ameliorated the&#xD;
      progression of the disease. The treatment is non-invasive, with no significant side effects,&#xD;
      and no need of hospitalization or anesthesia. The trial is phase II double blind study&#xD;
      including 100 AD patients ages between 50 to 80 with mild or moderate AD (Mini Mental State&#xD;
      Examination [MMSE] 16 to 26) divided into 3 groups. All participants will receive standard&#xD;
      medical therapy for AD. In addition, patients recruited for the study will receive 16&#xD;
      sessions of TMS with the H2 coil over 8 weeks. The first group will receive excitatory&#xD;
      stimulation of 10 Hz over the prefrontal and parietal cortex, the second group will receive&#xD;
      inhibitory stimulation of 1 Hz over similar brain areas and control patients will receive the&#xD;
      same amount of Sham sessions. Patient will receive 3 treatments per week in the first 3 weeks&#xD;
      and then 1 treatment per week for additional 4 weeks. Patients will be evaluated before the&#xD;
      treatments, after 8 weeks of treatment and after another 8 weeks without treatment. The&#xD;
      evaluations will include cognitive function according to ADAS-COG and MMSE, Activity of daily&#xD;
      living (ADL) functions according to ADSC-ADL, behavioral function according to the&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), depression according to the Cornell Scale for Depression in&#xD;
      Dementia (CSDD), care giver satisfaction according to the RUD LITE scale and computerized&#xD;
      cognitive evaluation according to the NEXING battery. We expect that the cognitive,&#xD;
      behavioral and ADL functions will improve better in the study group as compared to the Sham&#xD;
      treated group. From previous trial of TMS in neurological patients, although not in AD, we&#xD;
      anticipate that adverse events rate will be similar between groups proving the safety of deep&#xD;
      TMS treatment in patients with AD. In case our hypothesis will be proven, deep TMS treatment&#xD;
      will be added as an important modality to the conventional therapy of AD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be received 500 mcg/d of lithium as supplement nutritional in form spring&#xD;
      mineral water&#xD;
