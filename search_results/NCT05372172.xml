      The primary objective of the Vanderbilt Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (VADRC) is to&#xD;
      provide local and national researchers with access to a well-characterized and diverse&#xD;
      clinical cohort, including participant referrals, biosamples, clinical data, and neuroimaging&#xD;
      data. The VADRC Clinical Core will create an infrastructure to support research efforts of&#xD;
      both local and national investigator studies to develop early detection, prevention, and&#xD;
      treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease. The Clinical Core intends to enroll up to 1000&#xD;
      participants, including individuals who are cognitively unimpaired, have mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, or have Alzheimer's disease. This cohort of about 1000 participants will be&#xD;
      called the Tennessee Alzheimer's Project. Participants will be seen annually for&#xD;
      comprehensive clinical characterization and then referred to other studies to enhance&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease research activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health crisis affecting 5.8 million Americans.&#xD;
      With the aging population, AD prevalence is expected to double by 2040. Successful AD&#xD;
      prevention and effective therapies require distilling complexities of the disease to better&#xD;
      model disease onset, progression, and treatment response. The purpose of the Vanderbilt&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (VADRC) is to provide a better understanding of AD and&#xD;
      related dementias, and to serve as the institutional hub of clinical, research, and&#xD;
      educational initiatives in AD. The Center will play an essential role in expanding AD&#xD;
      discoveries and reducing the burden of AD locally and nationally. To do so, the VADRC will&#xD;
      support multiple human studies and model systems research over the coming years. For the&#xD;
      Tennessee Alzheimer's Project, the team will establish, phenotype, and annually follow a&#xD;
      cohort of adults age 60 and older with and without memory problems. Phenotyping will include&#xD;
      standardized protocols implemented across the entire national ADRC network as part of the&#xD;
      National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center as well as protocols specific to our local site,&#xD;
      including (but not limited to) venous blood draw, questionnaires, physical examination,&#xD;
      echocardiogram, neuropsychological assessment, multi-modal neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid acquisition via lumbar puncture. As part of the Center's autopsy program, the&#xD;
      investigators will ask all Tennessee Alzheimer's Project participants to consider post-mortem&#xD;
      donation of their brain, eyes, and a small skin sample. While fluid and neuroimaging&#xD;
      biomarkers exist for some neuropathologies associated with AD and related dementias,&#xD;
      postmortem characterization is the only current way to definitively confirm the presence and&#xD;
      severity of disease. Locally, a robust tissue bank with excellent ante-mortem phenotyping&#xD;
      will provide invaluable tissue for analyses distilling the complexities of AD.&#xD;
