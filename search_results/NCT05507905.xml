  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if physical activity (dancing) is&#xD;
      important for maintaining and improving memory in older adults and, if so, how many times a&#xD;
      week is necessary. If a participant is deemed qualified to participate, he/she will be placed&#xD;
      into one of four groups and will attend 1, 2, or 3 group or music appreciation classes per&#xD;
      week for 24 weeks. In addition to attending the group classes, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete at least four study visits at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center to complete various&#xD;
      clinical assessments.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      IGROOVE is an individually randomized group treatment trial that is controlled and&#xD;
      single-blind. It will enroll adults aged 65 years and older who are low-active, report a&#xD;
      Cognitive Change Index score â‰¥16, do not meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment or&#xD;
      dementia, are healthy enough to complete repeated graded exercise testing (GXT), and have no&#xD;
      contraindications for Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Randomization will be assessed to&#xD;
      ensure equal distribution across study arms for these sex and body mass index (BMI) and will&#xD;
      be stratified if necessary. New participants will be rolled into the intervention every 6&#xD;
      weeks with the beginning of the new form. Data collection will take place at Atrium Wake&#xD;
      Forest Baptist Health. Interventions will take place in community sites, such as local dance&#xD;
      studios, community centers, community gyms or churches. All intervention sites selected will&#xD;
      be handicap accessible, well-lit, have appropriate flooring for safe dance movement, and&#xD;
      access to sturdy chairs without wheels or arms.&#xD;

    <measure>Lifestyle Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly Up through Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire that shows perceived confidence to engage in sufficient physical activity through accumulation over extended periods of time. The scale has a range of scores from 0-90. A higher number on the score represents a higher self-efficacy for exercise.</description>

    <measure>Expanded short physical performance battery (eSPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The eSPPB is a brief test of global mobility function with excellent test-retest and inter-examiner reliability; is sensitive to change; is safe, and is a robust predictor of future physical disability and death. To avoid ceiling effects, investigators will use an expanded version (eSPPB) that increases the difficulty of the standing balance task by asking participants to hold postures for 30 instead of 10 seconds, adds a one-leg stand, and adds a narrow walk. The resulting score is normally distributed, continuous, and shows greater sensitivity to change. Dementia patients have lower scores on the SPPB so a favorable outcome for this outcome measure would be a significantly higher score post treatment. The eSPPB is scored as a continuous measure with a maximum score of 3.0 where 3 is the best possible outcome.</description>
