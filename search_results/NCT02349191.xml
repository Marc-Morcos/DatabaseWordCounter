      This study is a prospective, single arm, non-randomized, interventional study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of Omental transposition (OT) in subjects with early stage AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within-subjects (repeated-measures) design will be utilized to compare follow-up outcomes to&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be performed at baseline, then at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months&#xD;
      following surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (GPCOG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eight-item Informant Interview to Differentiate Aging and Dementia (AD8) Subjects who&#xD;
           have early stage AD confirmed by a neuropsychological test (MoCA) and who are healthy&#xD;
           enough to undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental procedure to be performed is omental transposition (OT) surgery. It will be&#xD;
      performed as a laparoscopic or open procedure for omental lengthening and an open procedure&#xD;
      for brain access, with a general surgeon performing the omental lengthening/tunneling and a&#xD;
      neurosurgeon performing brain access/brain biopsy/omental placement on brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to twenty-five (25) subjects, with the first 5 subjects being part of a learning curve&#xD;
      group and the next 20 subjects being part of the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of each subject's participation will be approximately 25 months from screening&#xD;
      through the 24 month follow-up visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental procedure to be performed is omental transposition surgery, during which a&#xD;
      general surgeon and a neurosurgeon work as a team to transpose a pedicle omental graft to the&#xD;
      surface of the brain. The general surgeon is responsible for performing a&#xD;
      laparotomy/laparoscopy, elongating the omentum into a long pedicle and developing an&#xD;
      extensive subcutaneous tunnel up the chest and neck to the head. The neurosurgeon is&#xD;
      responsible for performing the craniotomy and securing the omentum on the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creating an intact omental pedicled flap requires the services of a general surgeon and&#xD;
      neurosurgeon. The first step in the operation is to obtain access to the abdominal cavity&#xD;
      laparoscopically using four 5cm trocars, or via laparotomy through an upper midline incision.&#xD;
      The omentum is then removed from the transverse colon, after which it is separated from its&#xD;
      proximal and central attachments to the stomach. The omentum detachments are made directly on&#xD;
      the greater curvature of the stomach, leaving the gastroepiploic arteries and veins within&#xD;
      the still-connected omentum apron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final separation of the omentum from the proximal portion of the stomach is done by dividing&#xD;
      the left gastroepiploic vessels, which at the highest proximal level on the stomach become&#xD;
      the short gastric vessels. The vascular connections to and from the omentum are now&#xD;
      maintained solely from the right gastric and right gastroepiploic vessels. In order for the&#xD;
      omental pedicle graft to reach the brain without tension, further surgical tailoring of the&#xD;
      omentum is carried out, with care being taken to ensure the preservation of a major omental&#xD;
      artery and vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the omentum has been lengthened to an appropriate extent to reach the head, several&#xD;
      small (3- to 4-inch) transverse incisions are made on the chest wall slightly lateral to the&#xD;
      midline, with the side of the midline to make the transverse incisions depending on which&#xD;
      cerebral hemisphere the omentum is to be placed. These transverse incisions are connected&#xD;
      subcutaneously, thus creating a tunnel that begins at the upper pole of the midline abdominal&#xD;
      incision and travels subcutaneously, up the chest wall and neck to behind the ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the subcutaneous tissue behind the ear is extremely dense, it is essential that the&#xD;
      tunnel at this location be at least 2-3 finger lengths in width so that there is no&#xD;
      constriction on the omentum in this particular area within the tunnel. As the omentum in the&#xD;
      tunnel passes behind the ear, it goes beneath the base of the scalp flap that had been&#xD;
      previously dissected in making the initial craniotomy incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurosurgery portion of the operation involves removal of a single piece of bone over the&#xD;
      temporal-frontal area, opening the dura mater, followed by the removal of patches of&#xD;
      arachnoid membrane, with care being taken to avoid blood vessels on the surface of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point in the operation, the omentum is laid directly upon the&#xD;
      parietal-temporal-frontal area, after which the dura mater is sutured to the omentum. It is&#xD;
      not necessary that the edges of the omentum be applied to the cut edges of the dura since the&#xD;
      omentum can be tucked under the edges of the dura for greater coverage of the brain. The&#xD;
      edges of the dura are then sewn to the top surface of the omentum using absorbable sutures&#xD;
      and the craniotomy is closed.&#xD;
