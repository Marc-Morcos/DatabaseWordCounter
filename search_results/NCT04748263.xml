  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is commonly admitted that social cognition impairment, like deficit in facial emotion&#xD;
      recognition or misinterpretation of others' intentions (Theory of Mind), are associated with&#xD;
      social behavior disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This kind of disorders are observed in Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's Dementia&#xD;
      (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), with severe deficits in FTD and lighter deficits in AD and&#xD;
      PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One explanation might be that patients apply inappropriate visual exploration strategies to&#xD;
      decode emotions and intentions of others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test this hypothesis and further to analyse whether different patterns&#xD;
      emerge from these pathologies.&#xD;

The Ekman Faces task (1976) tests the recognition of the six facial basic emotions and neutral faces. There were four pictures per emotion, for a total of 28. For each picture, participants were asked to select one of the seven labels (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, surprise and neutral)</description>

    <description>To study correlations between eye gaze strategies, Facial emotion recognition and Affective ToM performances, and behavioral disorders.&#xD;
Evaluation criteria: Scores to the &quot; Reading the Mind in the Eyes &quot; test (Baron-Cohen 2001). 36 black-and-white photographs of the eye area of faces. Subjects are asked to choose which word, among four options, best described what the character in the photograph was thinking or feeling. For this task, four scores were obtained: a total score (/36) and three emotional valence sub-scores: positive (/8), neutral (/16) and negative (/12).</description>

    <description>To study correlations between eye gaze strategies, Facial emotion recognition and Affective ToM performances, and behavioral disorders.&#xD;
Evaluation criteria: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), a scale that includes ten behavioral items (delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability and aberrant motor behaviors) and two neurovegetative symptoms (sleep and appetite disorders). Both the frequency (/5) and the severity (/3) of each behavior were determined and a score was calculated by multiplying the frequency and the severity of each behavior observed during the last month.</description>

    <description>The study is conducted in accordance with usual practices of eye-tracking and neuropsychological evaluations carried out at the Center Rainier III.&#xD;
Eye-TrackerÂ® is used at the Centre Rainier III since August 2014. It is a non-invasive device for eye movements recording, allowing doctors and researchers to measure standard parameters related to eye movements. Developed by the Eye Brain Company (France), this is a Class IIa medical device, CE marking, according to Annexe IX of the directive 93/42/CE.</description>
