  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical symptoms appear, there is a long period when changes&#xD;
      in the brain occur. In this long asymptomatic period or preclinical phase, studies with&#xD;
      populations at risk of developing AD have shown cognitive differences compared to control&#xD;
      groups without such risk. There is a need for short, sensitive, easily administered,&#xD;
      reproducible, non-expensive and independent of socio-demographic influences tests enabling&#xD;
      the detection of pre-symptomatic variations in memory, when the memory decline is still&#xD;
      within a normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study main hypothesis: When evaluated with high-demanding tests of memory and executive&#xD;
      function, the cognitive performance of cognitive healthy people aged between 45 and 65 and,&#xD;
      extensively, to a group of up to 75 years, will vary significantly depending on clinical,&#xD;
      socio-demographic and genetic features&#xD;

      The purpose of Study 45-65 is to assess if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endogenous factors (clinical history, risk factors, genetic factors APOE4, etc…),&#xD;
           exogenous (socio-demographic, ambient and lifestyle variables) and cognitive reserve&#xD;
           (including bilingualism) influence cognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New and/or updated tests translated and validated in Spanish and Catalan when needed,&#xD;
           will provide accurate and sensitive measurements of the variability of cognitive&#xD;
           performance in this target population, representative of the preclinical phase of&#xD;
           Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optional visit is offered to study participants that includes: cerebral magnetic&#xD;
      resonance, vascular ultrasound and olfactory testing.&#xD;
