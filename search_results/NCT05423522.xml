      This French Study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group, double-blind period followed by an open-label trial period to Evaluate&#xD;
      Clinical Safety and Efficacy of NanoLithium® NP03 in Patients With Mild-to-severe Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NanoLithium® NP03 (N=34)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (N=34)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase will consist of a double blind 12-week -period, which will be followed by an&#xD;
      open-label 36-week period for each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 18 clinical or phone call visits are scheduled during this study. During the&#xD;
      follow-up, clinical, biological, electrophysiological, imaging assessments and questionnaires&#xD;
      will be performed to determine the safety, efficacy, and disease-modifying effect of&#xD;
      NanoLithium® NP03.&#xD;
