    <textblock>
      At present, there is no treatment for dementia that changes the course of the disease.&#xD;
      However, it is now understood that the proteins in dementias such as Alzheimer's disease are&#xD;
      present years before someone develops symptoms of dementia. Studies may therefore need to&#xD;
      give potential treatments to patients before they develop symptoms of dementia. To do this,&#xD;
      researchers need a way of predicting who will go on to develop dementia in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several ways of doing this, however, many of these methods are costly and difficult&#xD;
      to implement at a population level - such as brain imaging, lumbar punctures or psychological&#xD;
      tests. In this study, the investigators aim to develop a method of predicting who will go on&#xD;
      to develop dementia (and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) using only the sort of&#xD;
      information that a general practitioner would have available to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, the investigators will develop a dementia prediction model using data from the&#xD;
      Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, which contains anonymised primary&#xD;
      care, hospital admissions and mortality data for the population of Wales, United Kingdom&#xD;
      (UK). They will then go on to test how well it performs in an external dataset, such as the&#xD;
      UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, no dementia drugs have shown a disease-modifying effect in clinical trials. It is&#xD;
      now understood that the pathology underlying Alzheimer's disease is present decades before&#xD;
      symptoms become apparent. Starting an intervention only when a patient develops cognitive&#xD;
      symptoms, and therefore when there is substantial disease burden, may reduce the chance of&#xD;
      any disease-modifying effect. Instead, targeting interventions earlier, when the pathological&#xD;
      burden is lower, may increase the likelihood of preventing or delaying dementia onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, there is a need for a method that identifies patients who are at an increased&#xD;
      risk of developing dementia. This requires the development of a risk prediction model, which&#xD;
      utilises multiple predictors in combination to produce individualised estimates of the risk&#xD;
      of developing dementia risk over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ideal risk prediction model for a population-based application would need to use&#xD;
      predictors that are already available to, or readily obtainable by, general practitioners&#xD;
      (GPs). Such a predictive tool could be used as a low cost, scalable method of recruiting an&#xD;
      'at risk' group of participants to future trials of risk modification strategies or&#xD;
      preventative therapies. Once an effective disease-modifying intervention is identified,&#xD;
      clinicians could use the same model to identify at-risk patients who may benefit most from&#xD;
      undergoing the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ideal dementia risk prediction tool would contain only information that is readily&#xD;
      available to, or easily obtainable by, clinicians such as General Practitioners (GPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to develop two 10-year risk prediction models: one to predict all-cause&#xD;
      dementia and one to predict Alzheimer's disease dementia, in UK adults aged 60-79 years,&#xD;
      using only predictors that are routinely available to GPs. They will develop the model using&#xD;
      data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, which is composed of&#xD;
      anonymised, linked primary care, hospital admissions and mortality data for the population of&#xD;
      Wales, UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will then go on to externally validate their dementia risk prediction&#xD;
      models in an external dataset, such as the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).&#xD;
      They will also validate an existing, published study using data from the The Health&#xD;
      Improvement Network (THIN) (Walters et al. 2016) using this external dataset, allowing us to&#xD;
      compare the performance of the models.&#xD;

        We will use data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank Dementia&#xD;
        electronic Cohort (SAIL-DeC). SAIL-DeC was created as a flexible, national electronic&#xD;
        cohort ('e-cohort') to facilitate dementia research using routinely-collected healthcare&#xD;
        data. SAIL participants were included in SAIL-DeC based on date of birth (1/1/1900 to&#xD;
        1/4/1958) and if linked primary care data were available (1.2 million individuals).&#xD;
