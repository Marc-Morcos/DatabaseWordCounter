  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study, we will examine how daily paced breathing affects plasma amyloid beta&#xD;
      levels and the rate of learning in older adults. Healthy adults aged 50-70 who meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be invited to this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of the two conditions: 1) Daily memory and attention training followed by a paced&#xD;
      breathing protocol designed to increase relaxation or 2) Daily memory and attention training&#xD;
      followed by a paced breathing protocol to increase alertness. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete pre and post intervention cognitive testing online, engage in 10 weeks of daily&#xD;
      brain training (starting Week 2) and 9 weeks of paced breathing (starting Week 3) at home and&#xD;
      to come in for lab visits to provide blood and urine samples on Weeks 2, 7 and 12 to allow&#xD;
      for assessment of amyloid beta levels.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in plasma amyloid beta levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from blood draws at lab visits on Weeks 2, 7, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>We will compute an aggregate score based on both plasma Ab40 and Ab42 levels. This score will be compared for Week 2 (pre-intervention), Week 7 (during intervention) and Week 12 (post intervention). We will conduct a time (Week 2, 7, 12) X condition ANOVA to test for a time X condition interaction in plasma Ab levels (to assess group differences in change).</description>

    <measure>Brain training performance on 12 Lumosity games during the breathing intervention (controlling for brain training performance pre intervention)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre intervention (daily during Week 2) and during intervention (daily during Weeks 3-11)</time_frame>
    <description>We will compute a general learning factor across performance on all 12 games played daily during the intervention period (Weeks 3-11). We will also assess game performance in the pre-intervention Week 2 to provide a baseline performance measure for each participant and statistically account for it.</description>

    <description>After completing brain training, they will then immediately do one 15-minute session of paced breathing, followed by a second 15-min session of paced breathing later in the day. During the paced breathing sessions, participants will clip a pulse monitor to their ear lobe and try to inhale and exhale in synchrony with a ball that moves up and down on the screen. They will receive heart rate biofeedback regarding whether they are achieving their relaxation/alertness goal.</description>
