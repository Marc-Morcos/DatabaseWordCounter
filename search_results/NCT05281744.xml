  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, pragmatic clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      collaborative care-coordination program embedded in a health plan for people living with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and their care partners versus usual care.&#xD;
      The study population will include community-dwelling Medicare Advantage members living with&#xD;
      ADRD and their care partners. Outcomes will be healthcare utilization outcomes of individuals&#xD;
      with ADRD and include emergency department visits, outpatient visits, avoidable emergency&#xD;
      department visits, and admission to long-term care facilities.&#xD;
