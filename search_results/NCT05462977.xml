  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro conduct a single-arm&#xD;
      intervention trial to investigate the efficacy of a music-based group exercise program for&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults. Up to forty participants will be recruited to participate in&#xD;
      a music-based light-to-moderate intensity group exercise program for 20 weeks (30 - 40&#xD;
      min/day, up to 6 days/week), which is designed for older adults with or without functional&#xD;
      limitations to exercise with chairs for the improvement of aerobic capacity, upper and lower&#xD;
      body strength, and balance control at a gradually increasing pace. During the exercise&#xD;
      sessions, participants will be trained to move in time with music playlists in synchronous&#xD;
      tempos. Primary outcomes are cognitive performance, mobility, and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life measured before and after the intervention. Secondary outcomes are adherence to the&#xD;
      exercise program as a potential mediator of the treatment.&#xD;

      exercise program as a potential mediator of the treatment. The research team aims to&#xD;
      determine whether (1) a music-based light-to-moderate intensity group exercise intervention&#xD;
      beneficially impacts mobility, cognitive function, and health-related quality of life in&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults; (2) the treatment effect is mediated by adherence to&#xD;
      physical activity; and (3) the treatment effect is moderated by cognitive impairment or&#xD;
      functional limitations.&#xD;
