  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measuring the rate of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) may enable us to better-understand&#xD;
      the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This study is using a new method of measuring&#xD;
      rCPS non-invasively, and to offer new approaches to the assessment of new therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have established the utility of [11C]-Leucine PET to assess the rCPS. This&#xD;
      study will use [11C]- Leucine PET to measure rCPS in AD patients versus age-matched and young&#xD;
      healthy subjects to determine whether a measurable difference exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve participants receiving up to two PET scans, a structural MRI scan. The&#xD;
      PET scanning procedures will involve some withdrawal of blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this proposal is to indicate new routes for treatment of AD.&#xD;

    <description>A primary outcome of this study will be to determine if regional changes in PSR, as measured by [11C]-Leucine PET, in early onset AD brain are lower compared to age-matched controls. The output parameter used to determine this will be derived from the most appropriate PET pharmacokinetic model for this ligand in human.</description>
