      The objective of the ADDIA clinical Proof-of-Performance study is to validate the performance&#xD;
      of ADDIA' blood biomarkers for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADDIA clinical study is a multi-centre, non-interventional, prospective, proof-of-performance&#xD;
      study with only one visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 800 well-characterized subjects will be recruited into 3 groups in 2:1:1 ratio, namely&#xD;
      patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with non-AD neurodegenerative disease (NAD)&#xD;
      and 200 control subjects (healthy as compared to their age).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  400 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD): 200 patients with mild AD, 200 patients with&#xD;
           moderate-to-severe AD,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  200 patients with non-Alzheimer's neurodegenerative diseases (NAD),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  200 controls (healthy as compared to their age).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      ADDIA study is dedicated to the proof-of-performance (PoP) of blood biomarkers for diagnosis&#xD;
      of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and will recruit approximately 800 subjects (400 AD and 400&#xD;
      non-AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTEXT OF USE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To quantify the performance of ADDIA' blood biomarkers for AD diagnosis (yes/no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the main objective of this study is to establish the performance of ADDIA' blood&#xD;
      cell-based biomarkers β-amyloid (Aβ) and protein kinase C (PKC) and corresponding assays and&#xD;
      to seek approval as In-Vitro Diagnosis (IVD) test(s) specific for diagnosis of AD, and to&#xD;
      validate the newly identified metabolomics and RNA signatures and selected protein biomarker&#xD;
      candidates, samples will be used from:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the patients recruited in the AD group and patients recruited in the non-AD&#xD;
           neurodegenerative disorders (NAD) group who are accurately diagnosed during the&#xD;
           pre-screening period, including by using three types of diagnostic methods: clinical&#xD;
           neuropsychological scores, neuroimaging (at least volumetric structural MRI) and&#xD;
           retrospective cerebrospinal (CSF) data: Aβ, total-Tau and p-tau biomarkers.&#xD;
           Alternatively to absence of retrospective CSF data, retrospective Aβ PET /Tau PET scans&#xD;
           can be used if compatible to diagnosis of respective diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the subjects recruited in the control group have no objective memory loss, normal&#xD;
           results on neuropsychology tests, and normal neuroimaging findings for their age, as&#xD;
           well as normal Aβ PET scan Tau PET scan and normal CSF Aβ, total-Tau and p-Tau&#xD;
           concentration if retrospectively available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For further validation of ADDIA' biomarkers, an integrative tool combining ADDIA' blood&#xD;
      biomarkers with cognitive scores and/or, neuroimaging (and/or retrospective CSF biomarker&#xD;
      data) will be used. The impact of polymorphisms associated with AD, such as APOE e4 (known to&#xD;
      be as risk factor of AD) on ADDIA' blood biomarkers will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Validate the ADDIA biomarker candidates: two blood cell-based biomarkers&#xD;
      measured by flow cytometry using Amoneta Diagnostics' proprietary probes specific to&#xD;
      beta-Amyloid (Aβ) peptide and protein kinase C (PKC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADDIA' blood cell-based Aβ and/or PKC biomarkers will also be combined via an integrative&#xD;
      tool with clinical neuropsychological scores (MMSE, MoCA, FCSRT) and/or neuroimaging (at&#xD;
      least volumetric MRI) scores for diagnosis and/or differential diagnosis. The impact on these&#xD;
      ADDIA biomarkers of genotyping in particular polymorphisms known to be associated with AD&#xD;
      (e.g. APOE e4, e2 alleles) will also be tested. In addition, the levels of ADDIA' blood&#xD;
      cell-based Aβ and/or PKC biomarkers will be correlated to the levels of CSF biomarkers Aβ and&#xD;
      tau or phospho-tau (or Aβ PET and TAU PET levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: ADDIA clinical PoP study will also validate additional new biomarker candidates&#xD;
      (identified previously and/or under analytical validation in the ADKIT study and&#xD;
      chronobiological studies) for AD diagnosis in peripheral body fluids; in particular, studies&#xD;
      on a set of proteins (using immuno-detection methods), metabolomics/lipidomics signatures&#xD;
      (using e.g. LC-HRMS method) and miRNA signature (using e.g. qPCR, HTG-NGS methods) are&#xD;
      planned. These new biomarkers may be used if needed to further enhance the accuracy of ADDIA'&#xD;
      blood-based Aβ and PKC biomarker test for diagnosis or differential diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADDIA clinical study is a multi-centre, non-interventional, prospective, proof-of-performance&#xD;
      group study without a clinical follow-up. About 800 well characterized subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled into 3 groups in 2:1:1 ratio, namely Alzheimer's disease, non-AD neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases and controls (healthy as compared to their age). The number of subjects is divided&#xD;
      into 3 groups as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  400 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  200 patients with non-Alzheimer's neurodegenerative diseases (NAD),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  200 controls (CC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will be age-matched and mean age similar in the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADDIA clinical study needs to recruit well characterized subjects in each group, therefore a&#xD;
      pre-screening or a diagnostic workup of the subjects needs to be performed by the clinical&#xD;
      centres before the start of the clinical study (during Visit 0). In ADDIA clinical study,&#xD;
      only one visit (Visit 1) is required for the subjects without any follow-up, in which the&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited and sampling of blood and urine will be done in the same Visit 1.&#xD;
      The following data sets will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data set 1 and samples available from visit 0 collected in the e-CRF after informed&#xD;
           consent signature:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Data from all subjects of the three groups include neuropsychological scores (MMSE,&#xD;
           MoCA, FCSRT scores), neuroimaging (at least structural MRI volumetric scores, and other&#xD;
           neuroimaging as needed for diagnosis) and laboratory data (haematology, biochemistry)&#xD;
           related to pre-screening and diagnosis. CSF samples obtained retrospectively by clinical&#xD;
           centres are needed if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data set 2 and samples from Visit 1 include in all three groups clinical MMSE, FCSRT,&#xD;
           MoCA tests (MMSE and MoCA tests to be redone on Visit 1 if older than 3 months) and&#xD;
           laboratory data (haematology, biochemistry), and blood and urine (and saliva and tear as&#xD;
           optional) collected during Visit 1 (clinical centres). The clinical centres equipped&#xD;
           with flow cytometry can perform experiments on ADDIA blood cell-based biomarkers&#xD;
           utilizing Amoneta' proprietary Aβ and PKC probes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data set 3 will be obtained at the end of ADDIA clinical study (Amoneta Diagnostics/Firalis)&#xD;
      and will comprise data on the performance of ADDIA biomarkers as described in details in&#xD;
      objectives 1, 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT RECRUITMENT AND SAMPLING&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to the inclusion in the&#xD;
      study (as checked by the clinical centres during Visit 0) will be enrolled in the ADDIA study&#xD;
      after the informed consent signatures. Sampling will be performed for the following body&#xD;
      fluids during Visit 1: blood (11 tubes, 2.5, 4 or 5 mL each) and urine (1 tube, 5 mL) from&#xD;
      all subjects. Saliva (1 tube, 4 mL) and tear (2 tubes, 0.15 mL each) samples are optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eleven tubes of blood and spot urine will be collected from each subject that has fasted for&#xD;
      &gt; 12 hours. The samples will be used as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 (two) tubes will be used at the participating clinical centres for routine lab tests,&#xD;
           haematology and biochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  9 (nine) tubes will be sent to Amoneta facilities in the following format:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 (three) fresh whole blood samples (3 Li-heparin tubes), 1 tube will be sent in the&#xD;
           morning immediately after sampling to the flow cytometry laboratory (Amoneta&#xD;
           laboratories or another laboratory chosen by Amoneta which can be a laboratory of the&#xD;
           clinical centre if equipped with flow cytometry platform) to quantify the performance of&#xD;
           ADDIA assays based on blood cell-based biomarkers Aβ and PKC for AD diagnosis and 2&#xD;
           tubes will be used to fix or prepare cells that will be later analysed by flow cytometry&#xD;
           at Amoneta laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 (six) fresh blood samples will be prepared on-site to obtain serum (dry tube), plasma&#xD;
           (EDTA and Li-Heparin tubes), PAXgene and PAXRNA samples and PBMC (Li-Heparin tube)&#xD;
           samples, which will be aliquoted and stored immediately at -80°C at the clinical centres&#xD;
           before being shipped at -80°C later on Amoneta/Firalis central laboratory for testing:&#xD;
           genotyping and gene, RNA expression (2 blood tubes), protein expression and&#xD;
           metabolomics/lipidomics (1 Li-Heparin and 1 EDTA tubes of plasma, 1 dry tube of serum,&#xD;
           and 1 Li-Heparin tube of PBMCs) during the ADDIA program and for validating the emerging&#xD;
           biomarkers and for replication studies during or after the ADDIA program (as may be&#xD;
           requested by regulatory authorities for IVD product approval).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine samples (and saliva, tear samples as optional) will be aliquoted and frozen&#xD;
           immediately at -80°C at the clinical centres and shipped at -80°C to Amoneta/Firalis&#xD;
           central laboratory for testing in selected assays based on results that will be obtained&#xD;
           on blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance evaluation of the ADDIA blood biomarkers Aβ and PKC (IVD) kit by AD&#xD;
           diagnosis in the form of binary outcome (Yes/No) after quantification of sensitivity &amp;&#xD;
           specificity of these biomarkers. This will be also achieved by using the integrative&#xD;
           tool enabling comparison of ADDIA blood-based biomarkers Aβ and PKC to and combination&#xD;
           with standard clinical diagnosis tests: cognitive scores, neuroimaging scores (and CSF&#xD;
           Biomarkers if possible).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance evaluation of the ADDIA' additional new biomarkers (RNA signature,&#xD;
           metabolomics signature and/or other peripheral biomarkers) for AD diagnosis in the form&#xD;
           of binary outcome (Yes/No) after quantification of sensitivity &amp; specificity of these&#xD;
           biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary consideration (for the evaluation of the diagnostic performance) will be the&#xD;
      comparisons between the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AD (Mild AD + Moderate-to-severe AD) versus healthy controls, and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild AD versus healthy controls, and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate-to-severe AD versus healthy controls, and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AD versus healthy controls+NAD groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary considerations (for the evaluation of the differential diagnostic performance) will&#xD;
      be the comparisons between the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AD (Mild AD + Moderate-to-severe AD) versus NAD and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild AD versus NAD and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate-to-severe AD versus NAD and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild AD versus Moderate-to-severe AD Tertiary considerations will explore potential&#xD;
           differences between NAD versus healthy controls and the subgroups of NAD (FTD, LBD, PDD,&#xD;
           PSP, CBD) two by two as well as versus healthy controls and AD.&#xD;
