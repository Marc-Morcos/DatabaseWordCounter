  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a study to try to improve our ability to identify older&#xD;
      adults who are at high-risk for progression to Alzheimer's disease, several years before they&#xD;
      have symptoms that might reduce their quality of life. The investigators believe they can&#xD;
      increase the sensitivity of tests of memory and problem solving, by using a very small dose&#xD;
      of a medication (scopolamine) that reduces the activity of the principal chemical system in&#xD;
      the brain that is changing in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. By pairing this&#xD;
      &quot;micro-dose&quot; drug challenge (that is administered with a tiny needle placed just under the&#xD;
      surface of the skin on the forearm), with our tests of memory and thinking, it is believed&#xD;
      that the investigators can create a &quot;stress test&quot; that is very similar in concept to the use&#xD;
      of the exercise treadmill to make the results of a heart EKG more sensitive to detect early&#xD;
      disease, as a cardiac stress test for heart disease. The investigators want to create a&#xD;
      similar stress test for Alzheimer's disease (AD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will take pictures of subjects' brains using PET imaging, in healthy older adults (ages 55&#xD;
      to 80 years) who have both a family history of AD, and who have concerns about changes in&#xD;
      their memory (but no clinical symptoms of AD), to see how much of a protein - that is related&#xD;
      to AD -is in their brains. When all subjects come to the hospital for PET imaging, we will&#xD;
      review the entire study plan with them, the risks and benefits of participation, and we will&#xD;
      obtain written informed consent at that time. Our goal is to compare performance on our new&#xD;
      stress test to these PET imaging results. Once the PET imaging is done, we will have each&#xD;
      subject come to our clinical research unit for a day-long baseline visit. In the morning we&#xD;
      will give the tests of memory and thinking, and then we will administer the injection of&#xD;
      scopolamine at a very low dose. We will then continue to examine the subjects, and to give&#xD;
      the memory and thinking tests at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8 hours post-dosing. Once they have&#xD;
      fully-recovered from all effects of the medication, they will be allowed to go home that day.&#xD;
      We will then see all subjects again, for much shorter visits to complete the cognitive tests,&#xD;
      at both 9 and 18 months after their initial study visit. We will follow all subjects for 18&#xD;
      months to see which of them show very mild but measurable changes on the memory and thinking&#xD;
      tests, as we predict that these will be the same persons who also had stronger results on our&#xD;
      stress test at the first study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all three study visits to our clinical research unit, we will obtain measurements using an&#xD;
      imaging device that uses infrared and blue light to take picture of the eye and retina. Our&#xD;
      secondary goal in this study to search for evidence of the same protein, in the retina, that&#xD;
      builds up and is seen with PET imaging of the brain in persons who are at high risk for AD.&#xD;
      Finally, we are also collecting a small sample of saliva, at the first visit to our unit, in&#xD;
      order to see which subjects have a genetic risk for the disease, as this genetic risk may&#xD;
      affect how we interpret the results of our new &quot;cognitive stress test&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a small dose of an already approved medication (used to treat seasickness)&#xD;
      will be used to temporarily, and safely, mimic signs of very early disease during just the&#xD;
      first day of testing. This is a methodological study to determine if tests that measure how&#xD;
      you think can predict the risk of dementia as we age.&#xD;
