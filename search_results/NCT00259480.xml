      The specific aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the immediate effectiveness of the intervention to reduce caregiver upset with&#xD;
           targeted disruptive behaviors (primary outcome). Hypothesis: Caregivers in the&#xD;
           intervention group will report less upset with target behaviors at 4-months in&#xD;
           comparison to caregivers in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the immediate effectiveness of the intervention to reduce caregiver burden&#xD;
           (secondary outcome). Hypothesis: Caregivers in the intervention group will report less&#xD;
           burden at 4-months in comparison to caregivers in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test the immediate effectiveness of the intervention to reduce the frequency of&#xD;
           occurrence of targeted disruptive behaviors in persons with dementia (secondary&#xD;
           outcome). Hypothesis: Caregivers in the intervention group will report a decrease in the&#xD;
           frequency of occurrence of targeted behaviors at 4-months in comparison to caregivers in&#xD;
           the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Test the maintenance effect of intervention at 6-months on caregiver upset and burden&#xD;
           and targeted disruptive behaviors. Hypothesis: Compared to usual care, caregivers in&#xD;
           intervention will maintain reduced upset and burden and report less occurrences of&#xD;
           targeted behaviors from 4 to 6-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess the cost of the intervention and its cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have also received funding to conduct a supplementary study to evaluate the effect of the&#xD;
      nurse intervention on behavior reduction and caregiver distress. The specific aims of this&#xD;
      supplementary study arm are to: 1) describe the prevalence and type of medical conditions&#xD;
      among control group participants who receive the nurse intervention, 2) describe for those&#xD;
      with a detected medical condition/problem, the number of caregivers who follow-up with&#xD;
      physicians and the type of physician follow-up/treatment that occurs; 3) evaluate whether&#xD;
      control group participants who receive the nurse intervention report reduced disruptive&#xD;
      behaviors and caregiver upset at 6 weeks (pre-post comparison); and 4) for control group&#xD;
      participants who receive the nurse intervention, compare the level of disruptive behaviors&#xD;
      and caregiver upset 4 months from entry into this study arm with the results in the Project&#xD;
      ACT experimental group (who received the multi-component intervention).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caregivers are eligible for study participation if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  are a family member 21 years of age or older (male or female),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  live with the care recipient,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  able to participate in the interview in English&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  have a telephone in their home,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  plan to live in the area for 6 months, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  report a high level of upset with behaviors as follows. We will use the Agitated&#xD;
                  Behavior in Dementia Scale (ABID),62 which is a 16-item psychometrically valid&#xD;
                  scale of behavioral occurrences and associated caregiver upset. We chose this&#xD;
                  scale out of the six primary scales used to measure behavior given that the&#xD;
                  behaviors most closely match the intent of the intervention we plan to test. The&#xD;
                  behaviors include those listed earlier plus one additional behavior, repetitive&#xD;
                  vocalization. For each of these 17 behaviors that occur in the past week (for the&#xD;
                  purposes of screening eligibility, we will use a yes/no response format),&#xD;
                  caregivers are asked their level of upset (0 = not at all, 1 = a little, 2 =&#xD;
                  moderately, 3 = very much and 4 = extremely).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caregivers will be considered eligible if they obtain a total summed score of &quot;3&quot; or&#xD;
             higher using the following algorithm:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Caregivers must report at least one behavior as very (&quot;3&quot;) or extremely (&quot;4&quot;)&#xD;
                  upset, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  caregivers must report three or more behaviors in which one behavior causes at&#xD;
                  least moderate (&quot;2&quot;) level upset and one behavior causes at least a little upset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Thus, caregivers with only scores of &quot;1&quot; ( a little upset) with three or more behavioral&#xD;
        occurrences will not be considered eligible for this study. That is, this criteria excludes&#xD;
        caregivers with no upset or a little upset. We will also require that the care recipient:&#xD;
        1) has a NINCDS-ADRDA diagnosis (physician generated) of dementia or a Mini-mental State&#xD;
        Examination (MMSE) score of &lt;23.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A caregiver is excluded if the caregiver or care recipient:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  has a terminal illness with life expectancy &lt; 6 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  is in active treatment for cancer, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  has had &gt;3 acute medical hospitalizations in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caregivers will also be excluded if:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  they are currently involved in another clinical trial of psychosocial or&#xD;
                  educational interventions for caregivers; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  they are planning to place their family member in a nursing home within the next&#xD;
                  6-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Care-recipients will also be excluded if:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  they have schizophrenia or a bi-polar disorder,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  their dementia is secondary to probable head trauma,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  their MMSE score = 0 and they are considered bed-bound, defined as confinement to&#xD;
                  bed or chair for at least 22 hours a day for at least four of the previous seven&#xD;
                  days,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a nursing home admission is planned to occur within six months or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  they are enrolled in a clinical trial of pharmacological treatment for agitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        These criteria exclude caregivers of ADRD patients at the severe stage of the disease&#xD;
        process who may not benefit from the proposed intervention.&#xD;
