  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to refine and evaluate feasibility of a telehealth intervention for persons&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. The intervention will use evidence-based&#xD;
      techniques for decreasing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and poor sleep, that are commonly&#xD;
      reported among this vulnerable group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improved symptoms among&#xD;
      this group may improve their other health outcomes and quality of life and furthermore the&#xD;
      quality of care that caregivers provide for persons with Alzheimer's disease during this&#xD;
      challenging time.&#xD;
