      JDOME is a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a computerized cognitive&#xD;
      training with the Brainer web platform and aerobic training with the JDOME system vs. a&#xD;
      computerized cognitive training with the Brainer web platform and aerobic training with a&#xD;
      standard exercise bike in subjects with Alzheimer's Disease at early stage. The JDome&#xD;
      BikeAround is a tool that take people with dementia on a virtual bicycle tour along the paths&#xD;
      of memories. It combines an exercise bike, a dome-shaped projector and Google Street View&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      JDOME study is designed as a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      training that combines the JDome virtual reality system for aerobic exercise with&#xD;
      computerized cognitive training via tablet. The Experimental Group (EG) will receive&#xD;
      computerized cognitive training with the Brainer web platform and aerobic training with the&#xD;
      JDOME system (a tool that combines an exercise bike, a dome-shaped projector and Google&#xD;
      Street View technology).The Control Group (CG) will receive computerized cognitive training&#xD;
      with the Brainer web platform and aerobic training with a standard exercise bike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment will be performed at the baseline (T0), at the end of intervention (after eight&#xD;
      weeks -T1) and 12 weeks after the end of intervention (follow-up T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to assess the stabilization of the global cognition of people with&#xD;
      mild-stage Alzheimer's disease at the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and at the&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog); The secondary aim is&#xD;
      the analyses of the modification of the quality of life, mood, behavioral disturbances, and&#xD;
      physical function in people with mild-stage Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in cognitive impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8, and 22 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>Mini-Mental State Examination was designed as a clinical method for grading cognitive impairment. The score ranges from 0 to 30: scores ≥ 24 indicate normality, between 18-23 indicate mild cognitive impairment, between 11-17 moderate cognitive deficits, scores ≤ 10 severe cognitive impairments. The reported score will be corrected according to age and education.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in short and medium term memory</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 and 22 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) consists of 11 items that investigate: short and medium term memory, language, praxia (simple, constructive, ideational), temporal-spatial orientation. The score ranges from 0 (no cognitive impairment) to 70 (maximum cognitive impairment).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8, 22 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>Alzheimer's Disease scale (QoL-AD) includes 13 items that evaluate subjective (eg, perceived quality of life and psychological well-being) and objective (eg, behavioral competence and environment) components of the quality of life. Items are rated by subjects with dementia on a 4-point scale from 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent). Higher scores indicate a better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in physical performance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 and 22 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a short battery of tests designed to assess the function of the lower limbs. This scale consists of 3 different sections: balance assessment, evaluation of walking on 4 linear meters, evaluation of the ability to perform, for 5 consecutive times, the sit to stand from a chair, without using the upper limbs. The total scale score therefore has a range from 0 to 12. A total score below 10 indicates frailty and a high risk of disability and falls. The 1-point change in score from pre to post test is of clinical relevance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in signs and symptoms of major depression</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 and 22 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>Cornell Scale for Depression in dementia (CSDD) contains 19 items evaluating signs and symptoms of major depression in individuals with dementia. Each item is rated for severity on a scale from 0 (absent) to 2 (severe). The information is collected through clinical observation and through two semi-structured interviews: one addressed to the caregiver and one to the person with dementia. The total score, given by the sum of the 19 items, if lower than 6 indicates the absence of depressive symptoms, if higher than 10 it indicates a probable major depression and finally if higher than 18 it indicates the presence of major depression</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in neuropsychiatric disturbances</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 and 22 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) evaluates 12 neuropsychiatric disturbances common in dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, night-time behavior disturbances, and appetite and eating abnormalities. A total NPI score and a total caregiver distress score are calculated. The total NPI score, which can range from 1 to 144, is the product of the frequency of manifestation and the severity of each disorder. Higher scores indicate more frequent and more severe behavioral problems</description>
