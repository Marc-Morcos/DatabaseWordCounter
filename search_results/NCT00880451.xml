  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The protocol objectives are to enable prospective IRB review of research using human MRI&#xD;
      scans and data collected under other branch protocols or extramural sources. By combining&#xD;
      data from multiple sources the investigators will be able to conduct analyses that require&#xD;
      large numbers of observations that exceed the numbers collected in any single study. They&#xD;
      will also be able to stratify and subgroup the combined samples in different ways to permit&#xD;
      analyses that would otherwise not be possible. The study population consists of normal&#xD;
      individuals and clinical groups of all ages. Clinical groups will be added by amendment&#xD;
      including patients suffering from schizophrenia, ADHD, autism, Klinefelter's disease, and&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. The study design consists of 1) automated segmentation of MRI brain&#xD;
      scans to obtain regional measurements of cortical thickness and volumetric measurements of&#xD;
      brain structures including basal ganglia, 2) manual segmentation of brain structures and&#xD;
      brain anomalies not amenable to automated segmentation such as Virchow-Robbins spaces, 3)&#xD;
      correlation analyses between MRI brain measurements and available demographic (e.g. gender)&#xD;
      and physiological (e.g. BMI) data, statistical analysis of group differences where the groups&#xD;
      are defined by diagnosis, age, gender or by other potentially useful classification. Since&#xD;
      all data were collected under other protocols there are no additional risks or benefits&#xD;
      associated with this protocol. This protocol combines MRI data from disparate sources and can&#xD;
      provide important information regarding factors that may affect the comparability of MRI&#xD;
      scans obtained from different sites using various types of MRI scanners and pulse sequences&#xD;
      to generate MRI images. It will also enable the analysis of specific subgroups with&#xD;
      sufficient numbers of observations for meaningful statistics.&#xD;
