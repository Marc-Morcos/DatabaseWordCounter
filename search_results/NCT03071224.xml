      The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate [18F]MK-6240 (also known as [18F]MNI-946) a&#xD;
      tau targeted radiopharmaceutical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the dynamic uptake and washout of [18F]MK-6240 in brain using positron&#xD;
           emission tomography (PET) in patients with Alzheimer's disease and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure blood metabolites of [18F]MK-6240 and perform kinetic modeling to assess its&#xD;
           ability to measure tau protein in brain using the tracer plasma concentration or a&#xD;
           reference region as indirect input.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain test/retest reliability of the tracer binding parameters in patients with&#xD;
           Alzheimer's disease and healthy volunteers (Cohort 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To acquire safety data following injection of [18F]MK-6240.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the longitudinal change in tau burden (including SUVR and tau distribution&#xD;
           metrics) compared to baseline in AD subjects and in similarly aged HV subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the correlation between the longitudinal change in tau burden and change in&#xD;
           clinical, MRI and CSF biomarker measures in AD subjects and in similarly-aged HV&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To further explore the relationship between tracer metabolism and smoking (Cohort 3).&#xD;

    <description>Tracer uptake will be evaluated in regions of interest for analysis of regional [18F]MK-6240 binding/uptake and expressed in SUV by using established methods for normalization for 12 AD and 3 HV subjects in Cohort 1, 8 AD and 2 HV subjects in Cohort 2, and 3 AD and 3 HV subjects in Cohort 3. Target regions of interest in the standard volume of interest (VOI) template, will be used for tracer uptake quantitation of potentially increased binding to tau pathology will correspond in particular to the cortical regions of the brain. Descriptive statistics will be applied to describe the tau deposition by region as measured by [18F]MK-6240.&#xD;
