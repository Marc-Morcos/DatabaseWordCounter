      The overall goal of this imaging trial is to evaluate [18F]MNI-952 (also known as&#xD;
      [18F]UCB-K), a tau targeted PET radioligand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize [18F]MNI-952, a PET radioligand for imaging tau.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To visually and quantitatively assess brain uptake and pharmacokinetics of [18F]MNI-952,&#xD;
           a PET imaging marker for tau pathology in individuals with Progressive Supranuclear&#xD;
           Palsy (PSP) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and compare with healthy volunteers (HV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of a single injection of [18F]MNI-952.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the distribution of tau (using [18F]MNI-952) and Aâ (using florbetapir) in AD&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
