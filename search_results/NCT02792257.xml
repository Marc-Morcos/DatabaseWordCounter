    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease of aging.&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in AD are a major cause of burden to patients, caregivers,&#xD;
      and society and are near-universal at some point in the AD course. One of the most troubling&#xD;
      of these symptoms is agitation (Agit-AD), typified by a variety of problem behaviors&#xD;
      including combativeness, yelling, pacing, lack of cooperation with care, insomnia, and&#xD;
      restlessness. There is a great need for better interventions that target Agit-AD, a major&#xD;
      source of patient disability as well as caregiver burden and stress, particularly in the case&#xD;
      of moderate to severe agitation. This pilot trial could open the door to &quot;re-purposing&quot;&#xD;
      Dronabinol (Marinol®) as a novel and safe treatment for Agit-AD with significant public&#xD;
      health impact.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease of aging, affecting&#xD;
      an estimated 5.2 million Americans and predicted to increase to 13.8 million by 2050. AD&#xD;
      affects both cognition and emotion. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in AD are a major cause&#xD;
      of burden to patients, caregivers, and society and are near-universal at some point in the AD&#xD;
      course with &gt; 97% of AD patients having at least one symptom reported on the Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Inventory (NPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most troubling of these symptoms is agitation (Agit-AD), typified by a variety of&#xD;
      problem behaviors including combativeness, yelling, pacing, lack of cooperation with care,&#xD;
      insomnia, and restlessness. In community-based samples, Agit-AD is common. Agit-AD is&#xD;
      associated with greater caregiver burden and shorter time to institutionalization, and there&#xD;
      is a particularly acute need for interventions for severe Agit-AD in advanced dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there are currently no FDA approved medications for Agit-AD, psychotropic medications&#xD;
      are widely prescribed &quot;off-label&quot; to treat Agit-AD. The most commonly used classes of&#xD;
      medications prescribed for &quot;off-label&quot; treatment are antipsychotics and antidepressants. The&#xD;
      evidence to date for efficacy remains mixed. Antipsychotics appear to have some degree of&#xD;
      efficacy, but the effects are not highly replicable and their use is associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia. Antidepressants (particularly&#xD;
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, (SSRI)s) appear to have fewer and less severe&#xD;
      adverse effects compared to antipsychotics, as well as no known mortality risks, but are not&#xD;
      without limitation. Therefore, exploration of alternative treatments for Agit-AD,&#xD;
      particularly severe cases, is timely and warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dronabinol (Marinol®) is FDA-approved for the treatment of anorexia/weight loss in AIDS and&#xD;
      for nausea/emesis associated with chemotherapy, which is now being used off-label for&#xD;
      Agit-AD. Dronabinol is a synthetic oral formulation of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a&#xD;
      psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant that acts as a partial agonist at the Type 1&#xD;
      (CB1) and Type 2 (CB2) endocannabinoid receptors. This pharmacology is appropriate for&#xD;
      targeting Agit-AD because CB1 receptor agonism can produce anxiolytic and antidepressant&#xD;
      effects and CB2 receptor agonism can be anti-inflammatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism by which dronabinol exerts its effects on agitation and aggression in patients&#xD;
      with dementia may occur through its action at the CB1 and/or the CB2 receptor. Agonists at&#xD;
      the CB1 receptor in the brain improve anxiety and depression in humans as well as animal&#xD;
      models. Dronabinol is an effective agonist at the CB1 receptor, which is generally specific&#xD;
      to neurons and localized predominantly on the presynaptic terminal where it inhibits&#xD;
      glutamatergic, dopaminergic and other neurotransmitter release. The CB1 receptor effects has&#xD;
      been observed to mediate the observed anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of THC.&#xD;
      Dronabinol is also an agonist at CB2, a potent anti-inflammatory receptor localized on&#xD;
      activated microglia. Patients with AD have increased central and peripheral inflammation,&#xD;
      likely as a result of the accumulation of beta-amyloid. Increased inflammation may have a&#xD;
      number of behavioral effects that could drive the agitation and aggression in dementia&#xD;
      patients. Dronabinol's effects at the CB2 receptor therefore could also produce changes in&#xD;
      behavior in AD patients by reducing inflammation.&#xD;
