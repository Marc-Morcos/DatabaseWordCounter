  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive skills are essential to live independently, manage finances, maintain employment,&#xD;
      and function in society. Loss of these cognitive skills puts a tremendous burden on society&#xD;
      as seen with dementias, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury. The INSIGHT-ICU&#xD;
      Study (Illuminating Neuropsychological dysfunction and Systemic Inflammatory mechanisms&#xD;
      Gleaned after Hospitalization in Trauma-ICU Study) is the first comprehensive and&#xD;
      longitudinal long-term cognitive impairment study after traumatic injury. The societal impact&#xD;
      of long-term cognitive impairment after trauma is immense given that these patients are young&#xD;
      and constitute a large proportion of employable adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive skills are the crucial abilities required to manage money, maintain employment, and&#xD;
      live independently. Long-term cognitive impairment (LTCI) is a disabling loss of these skills&#xD;
      that can persist for months to years. LTCI frequently occurs after primary brain injury&#xD;
      (e.g., traumatic brain injury, hypoxia), but older LTCI research has not characterized&#xD;
      primary brain injury using NIH Common Data Elements in Imaging, the contributions of&#xD;
      polytrauma, and the time-course of the critical illness, including secondary brain injury&#xD;
      (i.e., delirium). In our recent large study of ICU patients without primary brain injury,&#xD;
      over 50% of patients had LTCI and nearly 50% were newly unemployed at one-year&#xD;
      post-discharge. In-hospital delirium was the major independent risk factor for LTCI.&#xD;
      Surprisingly, this delirium-related LTCI was similar to the LTCI seen in past studies after&#xD;
      moderate traumatic brain injury. Thus, both primary and secondary brain injury are associated&#xD;
      with LTCI, yet they have not been studied together. There is an unmet need to define the&#xD;
      independent risks of primary brain injury and delirium in LTCI. The trauma ICU patient is at&#xD;
      combined risk for primary brain and/or multisystem injuries, secondary brain injury, and&#xD;
      critical illness; these critically injured patients are the unique population to address this&#xD;
      knowledge gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, our FIRST HYPOTHESIS is that delirium duration is an independent risk for the&#xD;
      severity of LTCI, controlling for confounders of co-morbidities, socioeconomic status,&#xD;
      pre-injury employment, primary brain injury, polytrauma, and critical illness. AIM 1 will&#xD;
      address this hypothesis by defining the independent risks of primary and secondary brain&#xD;
      injury on the severity of LTCI among trauma ICU subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But, LTCI's real-world impact on employment has not been explained or adjusted for the above&#xD;
      confounders and social factors. Accordingly, our SECOND HYPOTHESIS is that LTCI severity is&#xD;
      an independent risk for lower level of employment, adjusting for similar confounders. AIM 2&#xD;
      will delineate the independent risk of LTCI severity on employment among trauma ICU&#xD;
      survivors. Lastly, LTCI pathogenesis may be related to persistent inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, our THIRD HYPOTHESIS is that hospital discharge biomarkers of persistent inflammation&#xD;
      will be independent risks for LTCI severity, adjusting for similar confounders. AIM 3 will&#xD;
      explore the mechanistic role of plasma inflammatory biomarkers on LTCI severity among trauma&#xD;
      ICU survivors.&#xD;
