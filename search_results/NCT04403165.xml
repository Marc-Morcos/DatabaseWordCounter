  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological changes begin decades&#xD;
      before clinical symptoms and tau abnormalities in the locus coeruleus (LC) can be observed&#xD;
      since midlife. We have previously demonstrated functional vulnerability of the LC to aging&#xD;
      and stress, as well as an association between higher CSF tau and impaired sleep phenomena&#xD;
      influenced by the LC. We now aim to test whether LC dysfunction can be measured in&#xD;
      preclinical AD stages by LC targeted imaging, and whether it objectively affects sleep&#xD;
      architecture and attention. We will test this hypothesis in 30 cognitively normal older&#xD;
      adults by performing a full clinical evaluation, one night of polysomnography, a lumbar&#xD;
      puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid, [11C]MRB PET-MR, and attention testing. This study&#xD;
      has the potential to identify a new mechanism by which tau pathology contributes to sleep and&#xD;
      attention dysfunction and may provide a new therapeutic target for AD prevention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is three-fold: to test whether lower NET availability in the LC is&#xD;
      associated with: first, CSF tau levels typical of preclinical stages of AD (Aim 1); second,&#xD;
      reduced REM and spindle density (Aim 2); and third, impaired performance on attention tasks&#xD;
      (Aim 3). The goal is to test the overarching hypothesis that LC dysfunction occurs in&#xD;
      preclinical AD stages, can be measured with MRB-PET, and translates into impairment of sleep&#xD;
      architecture (LC tonic dysfunction) and attention (LC phasic dysfunction).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Male and female subjects with normal cognition and 60-75 years of age will be&#xD;
             enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be within normal limits on neurological and psychiatric examinations.&#xD;
             All subjects enrolled will have both a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)=0 and a MMSE&gt;27.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will have had a minimum of 12 years of education. Among underrepresented&#xD;
             group (URG) subjects, &gt;80% of the elderly individuals coming to the NYU-ADRC meet this&#xD;
             criterion. (The education restriction reduces performance variance on cognitive test&#xD;
             measures and improves the sensitivity for detecting pathology and disease progression&#xD;
             using the robust norms available at the NYU ADRC. Given the majority of subjects will&#xD;
             meet this criterion we do not consider this a major selection bias or generalization&#xD;
             limitation for this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An informed family member or life-partner (preferably bed-partner) will be interviewed&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of brain tumor, MRI evidence of brain damage or brain disease including&#xD;
             significant trauma, hydrocephalus, seizures, mental retardation or other serious&#xD;
             neurological disorder (e.g. Parkinson's disease or other movement disorders). Subjects&#xD;
             with a Fazekas scale &gt;2 will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant history of alcoholism or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar, PTSD, or life-long&#xD;
             history of major depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Geriatric Depression Scale (short form)&gt;5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insulin dependent diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of clinically relevant cardiac, pulmonary, endocrine or hematological&#xD;
             conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical impairment of such severity as to adversely affect the validity of&#xD;
             psychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prosthetic devices (e.g., pacemaker or surgical clips) that constitutes a hazard&#xD;
             for MRI imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a first-degree family member with early onset (age &lt;60 years) dementia.&#xD;
