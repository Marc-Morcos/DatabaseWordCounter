      We hypothesize that the antioxidant and cytoprotective functions of vitamin E combined with&#xD;
      the cortisol-lowering effect of chocolate polyphenols and physical activity may help prevent&#xD;
      the age-dependent decline of mitochondrial function and nutrient metabolism in skeletal&#xD;
      muscle, key underpinning events in protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) and muscle wasting in&#xD;
      the elderly. To test this hypothesis, a vitamin E functionalized dark chocolate rich in&#xD;
      polyphenols will be developed with the collaboration of Nestlè Company, and its effects will&#xD;
      be investigated combined with physical activity in a 6-month randomized case-control trial on&#xD;
      pre-dementia elderly patients, a well-defined population of subjects at risk of&#xD;
      undernutrition and frailty. Subjects stabilized on a protein-rich diet (0.9-1.0 g protein/Kg&#xD;
      ideal body weight/day) and physical exercise program (High Intensity Interval Training&#xD;
      specifically developed for these subjects), will be randomized in 3 groups (n = 25 each):&#xD;
      controls (Group A) will maintain the baseline diet and cases will receive either 30 g/day of&#xD;
      dark chocolate containing 500 mg total polyphenols (corresponding to 60 mg epicatechin) and&#xD;
      100 mg vitamin E (as RRR-alpha-tocopherol) (Group B) or the high polyphenol chocolate without&#xD;
      additional vitamin E (Group C). Diet will be isocaloric and with the same intake of&#xD;
      polyphenols and vitamin E in the 3 groups. Muscle mass will be the primary endpoint and other&#xD;
      clinical endpoints will include neurocognitive status and previously identified biomolecular&#xD;
      indices of frailty in pre-dementia patients. Muscle biopsies will be collected to assess&#xD;
      myocyte contraction and mitochondrial metabolism. Laboratory endpoints will include the&#xD;
      nutritional compliance to the proposed intervention (blood polyphenols and vitamin E status&#xD;
      and metabolism), 24-h salivary cortisol, steroid hormones and IGF-1, and molecular indices of&#xD;
      inflammation, oxidant stress, cell death and autophagy. These parameters will be investigated&#xD;
      in muscle and blood cells by state-of-the-art omics techniques. Molecular and nutritional&#xD;
      findings will also be confirmed in vitro using skeletal myotubes, blood leukocytes and neural&#xD;
      cell lines. Clinical and laboratory results will be processed by a dedicated bioinformatics&#xD;
      platform (developed with the external collaboration of the omics company Molecular Horizon&#xD;
      Srl) to interpret the molecular response to the nutritional intervention and to personalize&#xD;
      its application.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Older adults are particularly vulnerable to undernutrition, a state resulting from&#xD;
      defective food intake or uptake (nutrient deficiencies) leading to altered body composition&#xD;
      and weight loss. Muscle wasting is a major drawback of this condition and a symptom of&#xD;
      protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) and metabolic reprogramming of tissues that increase the&#xD;
      ageing process. These changes sustain insulin resistance and impaired mitochondrial&#xD;
      metabolism of critical organs and tissues, including skeletal muscle. Prevention of&#xD;
      undernutrition is critical. Undernutrition correlates with an accelerated and general decline&#xD;
      in health conditions (worsening both physical and cognitive/mental aspects), thus increasing&#xD;
      the risk of frailty and finally accelerating physical and cognitive decline. Under these&#xD;
      circumstances, the majority of people experience a significant loss of locomotor function,&#xD;
      with a significant decline in quality of life, and a high risk of falls which often&#xD;
      represents the terminal event in life. These factors can lower the frailty threshold for the&#xD;
      oldest-old, with the consequent loss of adaptability, which is an essential feature of&#xD;
      successful ageing. This process of deteriorating mobility is multifactorial and also includes&#xD;
      decline in cognitive function, increased bone fragility, and reduced joint flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strong evidence suggests that ageing and cognitive decline are associated with dysregulation&#xD;
      of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis), with a clear increase in cortisol&#xD;
      levels. The effects of hypercortisolism are far-reaching, affecting the skeletal muscle&#xD;
      widely, thus leading to significant sarcopenia and fragility. It is well known that HPA axis&#xD;
      activity is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. This dysregulation induces an&#xD;
      increase in cortisol levels. High levels of cortisol, one of the most catabolic hormones,&#xD;
      also lead to noticeable sarcopenia. Mechanistic aspects include antagonistic effects on the&#xD;
      insulin axis (secondary insulin resistance) and consequent metabolic reprogramming of tissues&#xD;
      to gluconeogenesis sustained by non-carbohydrate precursors that include amino acids derived&#xD;
      from the proteolytic degradation of muscle proteins. Comorbidity in frail people can further&#xD;
      sustain the secretion and metabolic effects of cortisol, especially undernutrition and PEM.&#xD;
      Some of us previously showed that cortisol levels are significantly higher in patients with&#xD;
      AD and severity of the behavioural symptoms, and more importantly, changes in body mass,&#xD;
      significantly correlated with cortisol levels. Therefore, cortisol levels, which are not&#xD;
      regularly evaluated in AD patients, would help predict patients at risk of weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, recent findings revealed a significant decrease in cortisol levels in response to&#xD;
      chronic physical activity in healthy individuals and patients with dementia. Physical&#xD;
      activity treatment (PT) is a non-pharmacological treatment with great potential to attenuate&#xD;
      the cognitive decline in healthy elderly. In patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) it&#xD;
      was observed that 6 months of PT significantly ameliorates BMI, 6' Walking Test (6MWT),&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Importantly,&#xD;
      PT may preferably be undertaken as high aerobic intensity (85-95% of maximal heart rate)&#xD;
      intervals (HIT), as this yields superior effects on the cardiovascular system compared with&#xD;
      PT of moderate or low intensity. HIT has successfully been applied in older individuals&#xD;
      (8,9), and in frail populations such as patients with heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with physical activity, macro and micronutrients, are reported to interact with the&#xD;
      activity of HPA-axis and to help reducing cortisol levels. Chocolate polyphenols appear to&#xD;
      have significant effects with impact on both mental well-being and metabo-inflammatory&#xD;
      symptoms of chronic exposure to such stress hormone (3,11-13). Cocoa-derived flavonoids can&#xD;
      lower the levels of the active hormone cortisol. Mechanistically, these natural molecules&#xD;
      inhibit 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) type 1, an enzyme involved in reducing&#xD;
      cortisone to the active form cortisol. The intake of these and many other micronutrients and&#xD;
      homeostatic factors decrease with aging due to general worsening of quantity and quality of&#xD;
      food intake. Together with micronutrients, protein intake is a critical aspect and a major&#xD;
      risk factor for PEM and frailty. Nutritional supplementation for frail people has been shown&#xD;
      to slow their functional decline, improving both muscle mass and strength, particularly if&#xD;
      this is combined with physical activity. It is now established that nutritional&#xD;
      recommendations, including adequate protein and micronutrient intake, are important for a&#xD;
      better quality of life in the elderly, which is common management approach of older people&#xD;
      who are frail or at risk for developing frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin E is a fat-soluble essential micronutrient with unique properties as antioxidant and&#xD;
      cell protection factor. It is present in cellular membranes of all tissues to scavenge&#xD;
      peroxyl radicals formed by free radical attack on polyunsaturated fatty acids. This function&#xD;
      is particularly important to prevent mitochondrial damage and the uncontrolled release of&#xD;
      free radicals from these organelles in the muscle. Its intake and function as cell protection&#xD;
      factor and immune system modulator can be compromised in the elderly (20); moreover,&#xD;
      preclinical and human experimental studies show that vitamin E positively influences myoblast&#xD;
      proliferation, differentiation, survival, membrane repair, mitochondrial efficiency, muscle&#xD;
      mass, muscle contractile properties, and exercise capacity. Furthermore, recent studies on&#xD;
      the human metabolism of vitamin E demonstrated that the biotransformation of this vitamin in&#xD;
      human tissues forms bioavailable long-chain metabolites with a role as tissue detoxification&#xD;
      (PXR and PPAR-gamma agonist activity) and anti-inflammatory (LOX-5 inhibition) mediators.&#xD;
      Therefore, for multiple reasons, vitamin E supplementation in the diet as a measure to&#xD;
      support physical training in preventing age-associated PEM is worth investigating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS The study aims to investigate if regular consumption of vitamin E-functionalized and&#xD;
      polyphenol-rich chocolate can support physical exercise high-protein diet to slow down the&#xD;
      progression of protein-energy undernutrition in pre-dementia elderly people. Specifically,&#xD;
      the primary aim is to investigate whether regular consumption of vitamin E-functionalized and&#xD;
      polyphenol-rich chocolate and regular exercise practice boost lower limb muscle mass in&#xD;
      pre-dementia elderly people. The secondary aims are to investigate the effect of regular&#xD;
      consumption of vitamin E-functionalized and polyphenol-rich chocolate and regular exercise&#xD;
      practice on muscle strength, cognitive function, vascular function, metabolic and physical&#xD;
      functions, as well as mitochondrial respiration, circadian cortisol curve, blood hormones,&#xD;
      and inflammatory status in blood and mRNA in pre-dementia elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE The study will be a randomized, double blinded, controlled trial with parallel&#xD;
      groups including active control and shame groups. One hundred and fifty individuals with MCI&#xD;
      and subjective cognitive decline without functional deficits will be screened for eligibility&#xD;
      and those that comply with inclusion and exclusion criteria will be confirmed and the&#xD;
      informed consent will be allocated for testing and undergo preliminary evaluations (T00).&#xD;
      After preliminary evaluation, all the individuals included in the study will undergo a 4 to&#xD;
      6-week &quot;Run-in&quot; phase during which the high protein diet (HPro) will be introduced and all&#xD;
      subjects will be trained to implement the High-Intensity Training physical exercise (HIT)&#xD;
      program that will be developed during the study. Immediately after the &quot;Run-in&quot;, a&#xD;
      pre-intervention (T0) evaluation will be undertaken. Consequently, participants stabilized on&#xD;
      the HPro Diet + HIT which will be the common treatment for all participants, will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned (utilizing an online statistical computing web program) to one of the three arms of&#xD;
      the nutritional intervention in which the effect of vitamin E (VE) will be investigated&#xD;
      separate or combined with the effect of chocolate polyphenols (HPP) compared to control&#xD;
      treatment. The intervention will last six months; assessments will be performed after three&#xD;
      months (halfway through the intervention) and at the end of the intervention (T1 and T2,&#xD;
      respectively). A follow-up assessment will be performed three months after the end of the&#xD;
      intervention after the restoration of baseline diet and physical activity conditions (T3).&#xD;
      Each group will include 27 participants; a 20% dropout has been estimated based on previous&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION Proposed sample size is 75 (25 for each group) , according to alpha =&#xD;
      0.05 and power = 0.8. Main outcome is &quot;muscle mass&quot;, and for all the groups treatment&#xD;
      duration will be 6 months. In 6 months in the target population the loss of muscle mass is&#xD;
      assumed to be 1.0-1.5% (+/- 0.5%) [5]. In Control group (Group A), which includes people&#xD;
      undergoing targeted exercise, the expected increase is 2% (+-0.5%) [5]. In treatment groups&#xD;
      (Groups B and C) the median expected increase at second follow-up is 4% (+-0.5%), and 1.5%&#xD;
      (+-0.5%) at 6 months [6]. The rate of lost at follow-up, derived from previous studies, is&#xD;
      20% (+-2%) [7]. Correlation between repeated measures is assumed to be 0.5, variance&#xD;
      explained by the between-subjects effect 6.25 and error variance 65. All estimates were&#xD;
      performed using Stata v.16.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) by &quot;power repeated&quot;&#xD;
      command. 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Statistical analysis will be conducted under the supervision of an&#xD;
      expert in biostatistics (dr Gili, at Coordinator Unit) and with the support of LIPOSTAR&#xD;
      software provided by external collaborator C2. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA, including&#xD;
      age and gender as covariates, with &quot;time&quot; as within-group factor and &quot;treatment&quot; as&#xD;
      between-groups factor will be utilized to calculate difference between groups. In the&#xD;
      presence of significant effects, a multiple comparisons tests with Bonferroni's correction&#xD;
      will be performed. The familywise alpha level for significance will be set at 0.05&#xD;
      (two-tails), with Bonferroni's correction when needed, for all the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIDE EFFECTS Sides effects may be related to the assessment procedures: strength, voluntary&#xD;
      activation, and electrically evoked potential tests may cause muscle soreness and discomfort&#xD;
      during the procedures. In case of persistent discomfort the procedure will be immediately&#xD;
      stopped. Also, side effect might be caused by blood draw and muscle biopsy: subjects may&#xD;
      experience some side effects related to the blood draw in the draw site, which normally gets&#xD;
      between the following days. Also, subjects may experience some soreness in the site of the&#xD;
      biopsy, muscle tightness and fatigue in the few days after biopsy was taken. In the case of&#xD;
      these events, subject will be monitored and the family doctor will be informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE A log-diary will be kept by each participant and will be&#xD;
      checked weekly by the investigators and collaborators. In the diary participants will include&#xD;
      information about possible adverse events caused by assessment procedures or related to the&#xD;
      diet and training, any important points about the response to the interventions, any possible&#xD;
      discomfort experienced during or after the training, or notes regarding diet and&#xD;
      supplementation. Prof. Gianluca-Svegliati Baroni of the Gastroenterology Division of the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Ancona, Italy will serve as external scientific supervisor of the&#xD;
      clinical trial. He is an expert in clinical and preclinical studies of human nutrition and&#xD;
      metabolism. He will advise on specific Code: CHOKO-AGE Data: 10/06/2021 Version:1 30 tasks&#xD;
      and monitor the different phases of clinical trial from organization to implementation of&#xD;
      activities, data gathering and evaluation/interpretation. The quality assurance standards of&#xD;
      University of Verona will be adopted to monitor the clinical trial. A delegate of this&#xD;
      University will be nominated to perform the monitoring of the different phases of the trial&#xD;
      utilizing internal SOPs. The entire set of clinical procedures, operator's activity and&#xD;
      collection of experimental data will be verified during a series of visits by the monitor&#xD;
      that will occur at the beginning and the end of each time point in the study (Time T00 to&#xD;
      T3).&#xD;
