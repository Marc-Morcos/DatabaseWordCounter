      REINVENT is a non-interventional, multi-center, research network-based cross-over study&#xD;
      evaluating the potential utility of a telehealth platform in improving the efficiency of&#xD;
      clinical trials. The study aims to enroll 30 subjects from primary care practices coordinated&#xD;
      through a single main study site. Potential subjects will be screened and randomized (1:1) at&#xD;
      Visit 1 into a 2-period crossover design study where 4 standard cognitive outcome measures&#xD;
      are administered at Visits 2 (Day 30 ±7) and 3 (Day 90 ±7), either remotely or during an&#xD;
      in-person visit.&#xD;

      Mobile platforms have been leveraged in a variety of industries to drive dramatic efficiency&#xD;
      gains. The technology enables redesign of key processes allowing for the more efficient use&#xD;
      of labor and capital leading to better performance outcomes. Telehealth is the use of&#xD;
      electronic information and mobile telecommunications technologies to support long-distance&#xD;
      clinical health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health and&#xD;
      health administration. Much of the focus for the Institute of Medicine and other government&#xD;
      agencies has been the application of telehealth to improve access to healthcare and&#xD;
      specialized expertise by extending the reach of scarce resources to underserved populations.&#xD;
      These platforms are also routinely deployed as disease management tools. A natural extension&#xD;
      of these aims is the use of telehealth in the clinical development process, where both&#xD;
      improved efficiency and the ability to be more inclusive of a broader patient population are&#xD;
      critical steps in modernizing the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REINVENT is a non-interventional, multi-center, research network-based cross-over study&#xD;
      evaluating the potential utility of a telehealth platform in improving the efficiency of&#xD;
      clinical trials. The study aims to enroll 30 subjects from between 9 and 11 qualified Radiant&#xD;
      Clinical Research primary care physicians (PCP), coordinated through a single main study&#xD;
      site. Potential subjects will be screened and randomized (1:1) at Visit 1 into a 2-period&#xD;
      crossover design study where 4 standard cognitive outcome measures are administered at Visits&#xD;
      2 (Day 30 ±7) and 3 (Day 90 ±7), either remotely or during an in-person visit. A 60-day&#xD;
      interval is required between Visits 2 and 3 to reduce learning effects commonly observed with&#xD;
      repeated administration of cognitive assessments.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age at screening 50 to 85 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of mild cognitive deficits due to AD based on the core clinical diagnostic&#xD;
             criteria of the National Institute of Aging and Alzheimer's Association (Albert 2011;&#xD;
             McKhann 2011) and reviewed centrally by a main study site Principal Investigator&#xD;
