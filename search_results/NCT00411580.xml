  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability and Aß-specific antibody response of&#xD;
      CAD106 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients also had a 2 year follow-up to assess disease progression where no drug was&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  history or presence of an active autoimmune and/or cerebrovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history or presence of seizures, with an acute or chronic inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;

             depression)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  immunosuppressive treatment including systemic steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  obtained a vaccination (e.g. against influenza) within 4 weeks before the first study&#xD;
             drug injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  advanced, severe, progressive or unstable disease that might interfere with the safety&#xD;
             of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  started treatment with psychotropic medication within 3 months (4 weeks for SSRIs and&#xD;
             other newer antidepressants without anticholinergic properties) prior to randomization&#xD;
             with the exception of mild hypnotic drugs (e.g. zolpidem, zopiclone, oxazepam) and low&#xD;
             doses of neuroleptic drugs (e.g. up to 2 mg risperidone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients, who are on stable treatment with cholinesterase-inhibitors (ChEIs) and/or&#xD;
        memantine for at least 3 months, and/or with SSRIs and/or other newer antidepressants&#xD;
