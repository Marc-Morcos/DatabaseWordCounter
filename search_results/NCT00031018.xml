    <textblock>
      In this phase I-II parallel design, randomized, double-blind clinical trial we will determine&#xD;
      if 3,000 or 30,000 units ingested hrIFN-a prevents deterioration of cognitive functioning in&#xD;
      patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (AD) and whether ingested hrIFN-a treatment&#xD;
      decreases acute phase reactants and pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in mild to moderate AD. We&#xD;
      predict that the novel anti-inflammatory agent ingested human recombinant interferon alpha&#xD;
      (hrIFN-a) will modulate inflammation and inhibit the natural history of AD progression. If&#xD;
      you are eligible, you will receive Aricept for 5 weeks (donezepil) and thereafter in addition&#xD;
      to Aricept either placebo (inactive substance) or interferon alpha at 3,000 or 30,000 units&#xD;
      every day for 12 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Inflammatory mechanisms contribute to neurodegeneration in AD. Acute phase proteins such as&#xD;
      the antichymotrypsin (a1ACT), pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1, and activated&#xD;
      microglial cells are all associated with neuritic plaques. a1ACT levels are elevated in AD,&#xD;
      correlate with cognitive decline and serve as a biological marker of intervention. a1ACT is&#xD;
      intimately associated with the 42-AA b peptide (Ab) in filamentous amyloid deposits and&#xD;
      stimulates the polymerization of Ab into amyloid filaments. IL-6 is found in AD cortices&#xD;
      prior to the onset of neuritic change, serum and stimulated PMNC IL-6 levels are higher in&#xD;
      AD, and may induce b-amyloid protein deposition. Microglia, CNS resident inflammatory cells,&#xD;
      produce IL-6 within the adult human brain, are IL-1a +, and are a prominent component of the&#xD;
      neuritic plaque. Because the pathogenesis of AD appears in part immune mediated, we propose&#xD;
      testing directly in humans whether ingested IFN-a can ameliorate AD. Because there is no good&#xD;
      model for inflammation in animal models of AD, we will directly determine in humans 1) if&#xD;
      3,000 or 30,000 IU hrIFN-a inhibits the natural history rate of cognitive decline in mild to&#xD;
      moderate AD using neuropsychological instruments as primary and secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      that 2) correlates with inhibition of acute phase reactants and pro-inflammatory IL-6. If&#xD;
      this novel anti-inflammatory agent inhibits the natural history rate of cognitive decline in&#xD;
      AD in this pilot phase II trial, this would provide the preliminary data to submit a phase&#xD;
      III clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IFNs administered by the oral route show a systemic effect. Oral IFN-a caused neutropenia in&#xD;
      mice. In contrast to their i.p. administration, oral IFN-a did not result in the presence of&#xD;
      detectable levels of IFNs in the blood. Circulating specific antibody to IFN blocked the&#xD;
      neutropenic effects of i.p. IFN, but did not block the neutropenic effects of the oral IFNs&#xD;
      (2). Therefore, we examined the expression of antiviral MxA message, a type 1 IFN-specific&#xD;
      induced signal, as a sensitive marker for type 1 IFN interaction with lymphoid cells in the&#xD;
      gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) using semi-quantitative RT-PCR on splenocytes from mice&#xD;
      and PMNC from man after IFN-a ingestion. Both mice and man demonstrated inducible levels of&#xD;
      Mx mRNA after ingesting IFN-a. Murine spleen T cells and CD8+ T cells also demonstrated&#xD;
      upregulation of Mx mRNA. Therefore, ingested IFN-a acts via established pathways of type 1&#xD;
      IFN signalling (3). Elevated levels of activated T cells, mainly of the CD8+&#xD;
      (cytotoxic/suppressor) phenotype, are found in AD brains in contact with microglial cells&#xD;
      (4). Interestingly, peripheral CD8+ T cells are depleted in AD patients (5). Lymphocytes&#xD;
      bearing T helper and T cytotoxic/suppressor cell antigens are found in hippocampus and&#xD;
      temporal cortex in AD (6,7). The data above suggest that lymphocytes are part of inflammation&#xD;
      in AD, and potential immunomodulatory T and CD8+ T cells that contact ingested non-absorbed&#xD;
      IFN in the GALT could migrate to the brain and decrease inflammation.&#xD;
