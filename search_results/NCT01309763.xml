        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease based on the NINCDS/ADRDA criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Assessing the severity of AD by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). AD of mild&#xD;
             degree has been confirmed if the MMSE score is in the range of 20 to 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hachinski Ischemia Scale is used to try and distinguish AD from multi-infarct&#xD;
             dementia. A score of ≤ 4 suggests AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The result of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan (MRI) of the patient's brain has to&#xD;
             be consistent with the diagnosis of AD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent signed and dated by the patient and the caregiver. The&#xD;
             patient's capability to give informed consent has to be confirmed by an independent&#xD;
             psychiatrist or neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age between 50 and 80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of a partner/caregiver knowing the patient and being able to accompany&#xD;
             the patient at the visits and being available for the telephone interviews. This is&#xD;
             necessary because some of the neuropsychiatric tests require information by a person&#xD;
             knowing the patient well. In addition, it increases the safety of a study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate visual and auditory acuity to allow neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential are eligible if they use a medically&#xD;
             accepted contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of the APOE status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A potential participant receiving conventional AD and hypothyroidism therapies must be&#xD;
             on stable doses for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 and during the entire trial&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A potential participant has to be on stable doses of all medications he/she is taking&#xD;
             because of consisting illnesses according to medical history (except AD and&#xD;
             hypothyroidism therapy itself which will be recorded separately) for at least 30 days&#xD;
             prior to Visit 1, if considered relevant by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active women of childbearing potential who are not using a medically accepted&#xD;
             birth control method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical trial within 3 months before Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of questionable compliance to visit schedule; patients not expected to&#xD;
             complete the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence or history of allergy to components of the vaccine, if considered relevant by&#xD;
             the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication for MRI imaging such as metallic endoprosthesis or stent implantation&#xD;
             in the last 6 months or allergy to MRI contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Operation (under general anaesthesia) within 3 months prior to study entry and&#xD;
             scheduled elective operation during the whole study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History and/or presence of autoimmune disease, if considered relevant by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent (≤3 years since last specific treatment) history of cancer (Exceptions: basal&#xD;
             cell carcinoma, intraepithelial cervical neoplasia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infectious disease (e.g., Hepatitis B, C).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence and/or history of Immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant systemic illness (e.g., chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease,&#xD;
             poorly controlled diabetes, poorly controlled congestive heart failure, other&#xD;
             deficiencies), if considered relevant by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypothyroidism, defined as any significant thyroid-stimulating hormone elevation.&#xD;
             Patients with corrected hypothyroidism are eligible for the study provided that&#xD;
             treatment has been stable for 3 months before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of significant psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective&#xD;
             disorder or psychotic depression.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Metabolic or toxic encephalopathy or dementia due to a general medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcoholism or substance abuse within the past year (alcohol or drug intoxication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Wernicke's encephalopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of any other CNS disorder that could be interpreted as a cause of&#xD;
             dementia (infectious or inflammatory/demyelinating CNS conditions, Creutzfeldt Jacob&#xD;
             disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, brain tumor, subdural haematoma,&#xD;
             etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of cerebrovascular disease (stroke, transient ischemic attack,&#xD;
             hemorrhage), or diagnosis of possible, probable or definite vascular dementia in&#xD;
             accordance with NINDS-AIREN criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior and/or current treatment with experimental immunotherapeutics including IVIG or&#xD;
             vaccines for AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior and/or current treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Change in dose of standard treatments for AD or hypothyroidism within 3 months prior&#xD;

&#xD;

             of consisting illnesses according medical history (except AD and hypothyroidism&#xD;
