    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study designed&#xD;
      to test the safety and efficacy of LMSCs (Longeveron Mesenchymal Stem Cells) for the&#xD;
      treatment of subjects with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of LMSCs (Longeveron Mesenchymal Stem Cells) or placebo in subjects with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease. Following a successful Safety Run-In Phase, a total of twenty-five (25) subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to (2:2:1) to receive low-dose LMSCs, high-dose LMSCs or placebo. After&#xD;
      randomization, baseline imaging, and study product infusion, subjects will be followed up at&#xD;
      2,4,13, 26, 39 and 52 week post study product infusion. Intention-to-treat study population&#xD;
      will be used for the purpose of the endpoint analysis and safety evaluations.&#xD;
