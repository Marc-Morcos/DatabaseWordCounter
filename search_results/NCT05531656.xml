      This is a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of two doses of CT1812 compared to placebo&#xD;
      for approximately 18 months (72 weeks) in approximately 540 participants diagnosed with early&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either 100mg or 200mg of CT1812 or placebo.&#xD;
      CT1812 or placebo will be administered as 2 capsules to be taken orally once daily.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a clinical scale that describes 5 levels of impairment in performance on each of 6 categories of function including memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The ratings of degree of impairment obtained on each of the 6 categories of function are synthesized into 1 global rating of dementia as absent, questionable, mild, moderate, or severe (global CDR scores of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3, respectively). The score is based on interviews with the participant and study partner, using a structured interview. A sum of boxes score (CDR-SB) provides an additional measure of change where each category has a maximum possible score of 3 points and the total score is a sum of the category scores giving a total possible score of 0 to 18 with higher scores indicating more impairment.</description>
