  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the READyR study (originally called SHARE-sense) is to redevelop and test an&#xD;
      intervention program to remotely assess for changing dementia-related care needs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unmet dementia-related care needs are highly prevalent, and are detrimental to the care&#xD;
      dyad's (person with dementia and their family care partner) health, safety, mortality, and&#xD;
      likelihood of nursing home placement. The first phase of this study involves redevelopment of&#xD;
      the intervention program into a 3-session values-based needs assessment intervention&#xD;
      (delivered over 6 weeks) designed for early-stage persons with dementia and their primary&#xD;
      family caregiver (i.e. spouse or partner). A secondary data analysis and focus groups will be&#xD;
      conducted in order to complete the redevelopment phase. Objective digital data on behavioral&#xD;
      patterns (from sensors and wearables) will be incorporated into a needs assessment that will&#xD;
      allow for dynamic tailoring of the READyR program to new and unforeseen care needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who voluntarily decide to participate in this study will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      three sessions: Session 1 for baseline assessments gathered from all participants (including&#xD;
      remote in-home monitoring), Session 2 for discussing the participant's care values and their&#xD;
      alignment with current patterns of activities (assessed by remote monitoring) in the home,&#xD;
      and Session 3 for addressing current dementia related care needs and setting goals for the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who complete this study will be offered participation in a follow-up monitoring&#xD;
      period to further study the possibilities for dynamic tailoring of their dementia-related&#xD;
      needs assessment.&#xD;

    <description>The Preparation for Future Care Needs Scale (Short Form) assesses the degree to which an individual has engaged in planning for future care needs in late life using 15 items and 5 subscales representing distinct planning processes (awareness, gathering information, decision making, concrete planning, avoidance). Items are scored on a 5 point Likert scale with higher scores indicating greater preparation for future care needs. Sorensen, S., Chapman, B. P., Duberstein, P. R., Pinquart, M., &amp; Lyness, J. M. (2017). Assessing future care preparation in late life: Two short measures. Psychol Assess, 29(12), 1480-1495.</description>

    <description>The Dyadic Relationship Scale assesses the positive dyadic interactions and negative dyadic strain experienced by caregivers (11 items) and care recipients (10 items). Items are averaged for a summary score that ranges from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more positive interactions in the relationship, or more relationship strain, respectively.

    <description>Subjective strain from caregiving will be assessed among family care partners at baseline and follow-up assessments using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), short-form (12 items). Scores range from 0-48 with higher scores indicating a greater degree of strain from providing care.</description>

Items are averaged for a summary score of 1 to 4, higher scores indicating greater degree of quality of life. Logsdon, R. G., Gibbons, L. E., McCurry, S. M., &amp; Teri, L. (1999).

    <description>Group A will start the READyR intervention immediately after the baseline Session 1. The READyR program consists of a 3-session, values-based needs assessment intervention designed to match objectively-assessed in-home activity patterns with subjective reports of participants' care values. The goal of the intervention is to address unmet dementia-related care needs and help couples prepare for the future, and reduce strain on their relationship, and help maintain their health and well-being. Session 2 will occur approximately 3 weeks after Session 1, and Session 3 will occur approximately 3 weeks after Session 2. Session 3 also includes follow-up assessments.</description>

    <description>Group B - the wait list comparison group - will have a 60-minute support session (comparator intervention) about 3 weeks after the baseline Session 1. The support session will include general information about dementia-related care needs that does not take into account the individual participant's care values or objective in-home activity patterns. They will also receive a check-in call approximately 3 weeks later, with follow-up assessments. Group B will begin the READyR intervention sessions following completion of follow-up assessments.</description>
