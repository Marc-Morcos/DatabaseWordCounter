  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apathy, defined as a lack of motivation in behaviour, cognition and affect, is common in&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases. Specific scales are available for the evaluation of apathy but it&#xD;
      lacks objective evaluation methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the changes in reaction time task according to the&#xD;
      presence or absence of reward stimulation and to assess the relation between these&#xD;
      performances and apathy scales.&#xD;

      MATERIAL: 13 patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), 15 patients with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD) and 91 elderly healthy subjects were enrolled. A computerized test using the&#xD;
      experiment software E-primeÂ® was designed to assess reaction times (in ms) in different&#xD;
      experimental conditions after a training trial (neutral, stimulation, stress, stimulation&#xD;
      after stress, extinction) and relation between the performances to the test and the Apathy&#xD;
      Inventory (AI) scores (lack of initiative, lack of interest, emotional blunting) were&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: Using a computerized test, each patient is asked to press a button (mouse of the&#xD;
      computer) each time the screen of the computer becomes completely white. After pressing the&#xD;
      button, a randomized colorized geometric figure appears on the screen, and disappears&#xD;
      automatically after a few seconds, replaced by a new white screen. Reaction time (in ms)&#xD;
      between a white screen and a press of the button is analysed. After a training trial,&#xD;
      reaction times are analysed in different experimental conditions: neutral - stimulation1&#xD;
      (patient gets points when pressing the button) - stress (alarm) - stimulation2 (patient gets&#xD;
      points when pressing, after the stress trial) - extinction (similar to neutral condition).&#xD;
