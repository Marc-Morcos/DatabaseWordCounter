  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and its prevalence is estimated to&#xD;
      exceed 100 million affects by 2050, becoming the main public health problem worldwide.&#xD;
      Classically, AD has been considered a clinicopathological entity characterized by a&#xD;
      progressive cognitive decline with early memory impairment followed by other cognitive&#xD;
      domains, and an underlying neuropathological pattern characterized by extracellular&#xD;
      accumulation of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) in the form of neuritic plaques, intracellular&#xD;
      deposits of tau protein in the form of neuritic strands and neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal&#xD;
      and synaptic loss and glial proliferation. In this context, a &quot;probable&quot; AD diagnosis was&#xD;
      based on determining the presence of dementia and ruling out other potential aetiologies&#xD;
      while a definite one required confirmation by post-mortem examination. In the last 15 to 25&#xD;
      years, progress in imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers has enabled a change of&#xD;
      the AD conceptualization from a clinical-pathological entity to a clinical-biological one.&#xD;
      These new diagnostic criteria also divides the course of AD into 3 stages: (1) a preclinical&#xD;
      phase, which would include persons with positive AD biomarkers and normal cognitive&#xD;
      performance (the subjective perception of cognitive decline [SCD] is also part of this&#xD;
      stage); (2) a phase of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), characterized by cognitive&#xD;
      performance lower than expected by age and educational level; and (3) a dementia phase, once&#xD;
      cognitive deficits interfere with the activities of daily living. This new conceptualization&#xD;
      brings the opportunity of identifying the disease in very early symptomatic pre-dementia&#xD;
      stages or even before symptoms appear, creating a window of opportunity for dementia&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of positive results in the different clinical trials performed to date in patients&#xD;
      with AD dementia has redirected the focus of therapeutic strategies towards preventing the&#xD;
      development of dementia. For this reason, a detailed characterization of risk factors is of&#xD;
      vital importance for identifying the persons who could benefit from a possible preventive&#xD;
      strategy, as well as the optimal moment to carry out the intervention. A recent effort by the&#xD;
      Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention, and Care reported the relative risk&#xD;
      for incident dementia of the main modifiable risk factors (low education in early life;&#xD;
      hypertension, obesity, and hearing loss in midlife; smoking, depression, physical inactivity,&#xD;
      social isolation, and diabetes in late life). In addition, the Framingham Heart Study has&#xD;
      shown that age, marital status, BMI, stroke, diabetes, ischemic attacks, and cancer are&#xD;
      independent predictors of event risk in the final multivariate model and were used to&#xD;
      construct a risk algorithm. These set of risk factors associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      incident dementia can be coupled with well-known genetic risk factors such as APOE genotype&#xD;
      and with the presence of very mild symptoms, like self-perception of cognitive decline to&#xD;
      create individual estimates of risk for dementia, taking also into account the presence of&#xD;
      cognitive decline or impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility of creating individual estimates of risk of dementia implies a personalised&#xD;
      medicine approach and results in a change from the traditional diagnostic paradigm to a new&#xD;
      one in which people at risk are attended in order to disclose risk factor estimates and offer&#xD;
      them personalised solutions. This paradigm shift brings important consequences. On one hand,&#xD;
      disclosing medical information may potentially generate emotional impact, psychological&#xD;
      burden or harm. Although current experience with both disclosing APOE-e4 genetic status and&#xD;
      amyloid status reveals that it is safe, one still needs to understand the potential risks and&#xD;
      benefits of disclosing risk estimates for developing dementia. On the other hand, newly&#xD;
      designed infrastructures that are focused in the assessment and follow-up of pre-dementia&#xD;
      patients at high risk to develop dementia are needed, since they clearly represent a distinct&#xD;
      population from the one attending dementia clinics. These &quot;prevention infrastructures&quot; would&#xD;
      offer individual risk profiling accompanied by personalised risk reduction plans including,&#xD;
      but not limited to, primary prevention advice and secondary prevention approaches (e.g.&#xD;
      inclusion in prevention clinical trials).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the ultimate aim of assessing and understanding the value of these &quot;dementia prevention&#xD;
      infrastructures&quot;, several research questions need to be beforehand addressed such as the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is disclosing risk factor estimates safe from the emotional and psychological point of&#xD;
           view?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there any benefits derived from the personalised plans received by subjects?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Would the creation of Dementia Prevention Clinics be cost efficient? The&#xD;
           BBRC-DevPrev-2018 study aims at answering the questions stated above.&#xD;
