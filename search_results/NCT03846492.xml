  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Agitation and aggression impose a tremendous burden on the individuals living with dementia,&#xD;
      their families, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia&#xD;
      (NPS) affect up to 80% of patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD). The mechanisms of&#xD;
      agitation in AD are poorly understood and the current interventions are only modestly&#xD;
      effective while having serious adverse effects. In this study, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      assess the mechanisms and treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD with the use of&#xD;
      non-invasive, brain stimulation approaches. By applying magnetic stimulation to the surface&#xD;
      of the head (transcranial magnetic stimulation - TMS) combined with electroencephalography&#xD;
      (EEG), the investigators will be able to study the mechanisms of agitation and advance our&#xD;
      understanding of AD. Further, the investigators will evaluate if transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) is effective to treat agitation dementia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and related neurodegenerative diseases are inflicting a global&#xD;
      healthcare crisis. Neuropsychiatric symptoms including agitation and aggression affect up to&#xD;
      80% of patients with AD. Among these symptoms, agitation and aggression are the most&#xD;
      burdensome for patients, families, caregivers, and the health care system. The mechanisms of&#xD;
      agitation in AD are poorly understood and the current interventions are only modestly&#xD;
      effective while having serious adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators propose to assess the mechanisms and treatment of&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD with the use of non-invasive, brain stimulation approaches.&#xD;
      Agitation/aggression is associated with abnormalities in the balance of cortical&#xD;
      excitation/inhibition. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using single and paired pulse&#xD;
      TMS paradigms such as long interval cortical inhibition (LICI) and short interval&#xD;
      intracortical inhibition (SICI) can assess this cortical excitation/inhibition balance in&#xD;
      vivo. The investigators will use TMS, combined with electroencephalography (EEG), to assess&#xD;
      cortical excitation/inhibition balance in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of&#xD;
      participants with AD with and without agitation/aggression and age matched healthy&#xD;
      comparators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique&#xD;
      that uses a very low intensity electric current to modulate cortical excitability and brain&#xD;
      plasticity. tDCS can restore excitation and inhibition balance by altering GABA and glutamate&#xD;
      activity in the brain. tDCS can be safely administered to awake persons and is very well&#xD;
      tolerated. Studies in healthy individuals and patients with AD have shown that tDCS applied&#xD;
      to frontal brain regions can enhance cognitive function. Further, tDCS applied to frontal&#xD;
      brain regions can improve depressive symptoms. The effects of tDCS on neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms are not known. In this study, the investigators will use tDCS applied to the frontal&#xD;
      brain regions to target deficits in inhibition and symptoms of agitation/aggression in AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done over a period of 3 years at Centre for Addiction and Mental Health&#xD;
      Geriatric Psychiatry Division and Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit and enroll 30 individuals with AD + Agitation (mild to moderate&#xD;
      agitation), 30 individuals with AD without agitation and 30 older healthy individuals.&#xD;
      Medical work up will be done as part of clinical care prior to study enrollment to rule out&#xD;
      medical causes of agitation. Clinical and cognitive assessments will be performed to&#xD;
      characterize participants at baseline. The investigators will assess cortical inhibition&#xD;
      using TMS EEG at baseline in the three groups. Individuals with AD + agitation will then&#xD;
      receive a 2 week course of active/sham cathodal tDCS to frontal brain region in a double&#xD;
      blind 1:1 randomized control design. Assessment of cortical inhibition using measures&#xD;
      identical to baseline will be done at the end of tDCS course. The investigators will also&#xD;
      repeat clinical and cognitive assessments after tDCS course and 2 weeks later. Measures of&#xD;
      cortical inhibition will first be compared between HC and AD, and between AD and AD +&#xD;
      Agitation groups. The treatment effects on clinical symptoms, cortical inhibition and the&#xD;
      rate adverse events will be compared between active and sham tDCS groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Covid-19 pandemic, the study has been modified to be administered in a hybrid&#xD;
      manner to accommodate both in-person and virtual assessments. Clinical and cognitive&#xD;
      assessments can be done in-person or remotely. The initial tDCS course will be conducted&#xD;
      in-person with the research staff. The remaining tDCS intervention will be completed onsite&#xD;
      or at the participant's home with virtual supervision from the research team.&#xD;
