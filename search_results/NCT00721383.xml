    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to test a 12-month multi-component health&#xD;
      promotion intervention with home-based family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      and other related dementias. Specific aims are to: 1) Test the primary hypothesis: The&#xD;
      Enhancing Physical Activity treatment intervention will be more effective in increasing&#xD;
      caregiver lifestyle physical activity than the Standard Care Intervention; 2) Test secondary&#xD;
      hypotheses: The Enhancing Physical Activity treatment intervention will be more effective&#xD;
      than the Standard Care Intervention in improving the following caregiver secondary outcomes:&#xD;
      mental health, physical health and physical function; and 3) Evaluate the process of&#xD;
      implementing a lifestyle physical activity intervention with family caregivers. The Standard&#xD;
      Care Intervention focuses on well-established care-related education and support needs. The&#xD;
      Enhancing Physical Activity treatment intervention focuses on two areas: increasing lifestyle&#xD;
      physical activity and addressing well-established care-related concerns that are likely to&#xD;
      interfere with increasing physical activity. A total of 190 middle-age to older&#xD;
      community-based primary caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease or other related&#xD;
      dementias who report some to moderate strain with caregiving activities will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the Enhancing Physical Activity or Standard Care Intervention. Data will&#xD;
      be collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months and include self-report and direct&#xD;
      observational methods. Data will be analyzed by using repeated measures models using the&#xD;
      generalized estimating equation approach. Family caregivers are a stressed population who&#xD;
      experience changes in their mental and physical health. However, effect sizes have been&#xD;
      minimal for interventions designed to only affect caregiver mental health. No study known to&#xD;
      us, has tested the added value of physical activity adoption in conjunction with more&#xD;
      traditional caregiver support and skill building. Study findings will enable us to evaluate&#xD;
      the behavioral , physical, and health-related quality of life effects achieved by the&#xD;
      combined intervention; and will add knowledge about the most effective ways of intervening&#xD;
      with family caregivers and other chronically stressed middle-age and older adult populations.&#xD;
