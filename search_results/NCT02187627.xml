  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to obtain basic information on three PET imaging tracers developed to&#xD;
      detect tau pathology in the brain. In this study, healthy control participants and&#xD;
      participants with AD will be studied. Information collected will include brain and plasma&#xD;
      kinetics, tissue distribution (in the brain), radiation dosimetry, and test-retest&#xD;
      variability of the signal in the brain. The study will consist of Part 1, Part 2A, and Part&#xD;
      2B. During Part 1, imaging data will be assessed on an ongoing basis and based on data, one&#xD;
      tracer will be prioritized over the other two tracers. The tracer selected will be further&#xD;
      investigated in Part 2A and Part 2B.&#xD;
