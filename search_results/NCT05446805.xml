  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will assess how depression, preclinical AD, and antidepressants affect driving&#xD;
      behavior in cognitively normal older adults (65 years).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal is to accurately identify who is at risk of decline in driving, to&#xD;
      forecast when decline will occur, and to intervene before decline, thereby reducing the&#xD;
      numbers of crashes, injuries, and death in older adults. The findings indicate that the long&#xD;
      preclinical stage of Alzheimer disease (AD), as reflected in amyloid imaging and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers among cognitively normal participants, is associated&#xD;
      with poorer driving performance on a standardized road test. This project will assess how&#xD;
      depression, preclinical AD, and antidepressants affect driving behavior in cognitively normal&#xD;
      older adults (65 years).&#xD;

    <description>A dosage range between 6.5 - 10.0 mCi (240-370MBq) is planned for [18F] AV-1451. A PET-certified medical professional will prepare and administer the [18F] AV-1451tracer. Prior to the administration, the dosage will be assayed in a dose calibrator. The volume of 18F-AV-1451 dose should not be adjusted by adding normal saline to the syringe. Participants will receive a maximum intravenous bolus injection of 10.0 mCi of [18F] AV-1451 followed by a 10 mL flush of 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline).</description>
