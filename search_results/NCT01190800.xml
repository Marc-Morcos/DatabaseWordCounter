    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess decision-making capacity in persons with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. First, our goal is to validate four French capacity assessment tools for persons&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's Disease : a French version of the Competency Assessment Tool for Consent to&#xD;
      Treatment and of the Competency Assessment Tool for Voting, two questionnaires assessing the&#xD;
      capacity to appoint a proxy either to consent to treatment or to vote. Second, once&#xD;
      validated, we plan these questionnaires to study decision-making abilities and their&#xD;
      determinants in persons with Alzheimer's disease and control subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study of Alzheimer's disease patients show a wide variability in decision-making abilities,&#xD;
      especially for the consent to treatment and the ability to vote. No tools are available to&#xD;
      assess the capacity to design a proxy. The purpose of this research is to assess&#xD;
      simultaneously four decision-making abilities in persons with Alzheimer's disease: the&#xD;
      capacity to consent to treatment, the capacity to vote and the capacity to design a proxy&#xD;
      either to consent to treatment or to vote.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit 320 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 80 non-demented control&#xD;
      subjects. Four decision-making questionnaires will be administered to participants to explore&#xD;
      participant capacity to understand, reason, appreciate and make a choice about the capacity&#xD;
      to consent to treatment, to vote and to design a proxy either to consent to treatment or to&#xD;
      vote. Once validated in the first part of this research, the questionnaires will be used to&#xD;
      study decision-making abilities and their determinants in patients with Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      and control subjects.&#xD;
