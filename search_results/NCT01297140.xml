  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is characterised by a loss of cognitive functions and behavioural&#xD;
      problems as set out under the term &quot;Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia&#xD;
      (BPSD)&quot;. The impact of BPSD in everyday life has heavy consequences for the patient and their&#xD;
      family. The precocity of incidence, the frequency and the intensity of the BPSD are&#xD;
      associated with a rapid decline in cognitive functions, an alteration in the activities of&#xD;
      daily living, and a decrease in the quality of life for both the patient and the helper, an&#xD;
      increased risk of hospitalisation and of institutionalisation as well as an increase in the&#xD;
      cost to the health system. A greater understanding of the risk factors for the occurence of&#xD;
      the BPSD would better allow the detection of patients who are particularly at risk for BPSD,&#xD;
      to anticipate the crisis situations by proposing early and adapted care, and to better target&#xD;
      the medicinal therapies. Certain observational arguments or results of retrospective studies&#xD;
      speak in favour of the role of the basic personality in the occurence of BPSD in Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. The investigators propose to clarify this role through a prospective study.&#xD;
