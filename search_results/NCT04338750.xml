  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of adults with dementia report higher distress, including anxiety and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, burden, and existential suffering, than caregivers of people with other chronic&#xD;
      diseases. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a behavioral intervention designed to&#xD;
      increase psychological flexibility in the face of challenges. Results from our recent&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study suggest that ACT is effective in reducing anxiety and associated&#xD;
      psychological distress in dementia caregivers. In this study, we will randomize N=60 dementia&#xD;
      caregivers in equal numbers to receive either 6 weekly 1-hour telephone-based ACT sessions&#xD;
      (TACTICs; experimental) or minimally-enhanced usual care (mEUC; control). We hypothesize that&#xD;
      our TACTICs intervention will be feasible and acceptable in this population and will have a&#xD;
      greater impact on reducing anxiety and secondary outcomes from baseline to post-intervention,&#xD;
      and 3 and 6 months later.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot randomized controlled trial is to assess feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and preliminary effects of Telephone Acceptance and Commitment Therapy&#xD;
      Intervention for Caregivers (TACTICs) of adults with Alzheimer's disease or related&#xD;
      dementias. Using a 2-arm randomized design, we will examine the effects of TACTICs compared&#xD;
      to a minimally enhanced usual care group (mEUC) in N=60 dementia caregivers. Primary dementia&#xD;
      caregivers with clinically-significant anxiety will be randomized in equal numbers to receive&#xD;
      either TACTICs or mEUC. The specific aims are to: (1) Evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of TACTICs. Feasibility will be assessed using caregiver accrual, retention,&#xD;
      and TACTICs session attendance rates. Acceptability will be assessed using a&#xD;
      participant-reported satisfaction item administered upon intervention completion. (2) Measure&#xD;
      the changes in caregiver anxiety and depressive symptoms, caregiver burden, wellbeing, and&#xD;
      psychological flexibility at post-intervention (T2) and 3 months (T3) and 6 months (T4)&#xD;
      post-intervention compared to baseline. Caregivers will be recruited from a variety of&#xD;
      sources, including the Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Center (IADC), Aging Brain Care program at&#xD;
      Eskenazi Health, and Indiana University Health geriatric psychiatry and neurology practices.&#xD;
      Study staff will contact potentially-eligible caregivers to assess interest and verify&#xD;
      eligibility. After providing informed consent and enrolling in the trial, interested and&#xD;
      eligible caregivers will complete baseline measures and be randomly assigned in equal numbers&#xD;
      to either the TACTICs intervention (n=30) or to mEUC (n=30) using a block randomization&#xD;
      scheme. Randomization will be performed in REDCap using a SAS procedure. All study personnel&#xD;
      will be blind to allocation sequence. The unblinded research coordinator will be responsible&#xD;
      for randomizing participants in REDCap. The PI, Co-Investigators, and research assistants&#xD;
      (i.e., recruiters and outcome assessors) will be blind to intervention assignment to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of outcome expectancy bias and to enhance the rigor of the trial.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Anxiety via Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale-7 (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in anxiety will be measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), which contains 7 items with total scores ranging from 0 to 21. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are cut-offs for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively. An add-on item assessing the patient's global impression of symptom-related impairment helps researchers understand the extent to which anxiety interferes in daily life. The GAD-7 has factorial validity for the diagnosis of general anxiety disorder and is sensitive to change.</description>

    <measure>Change in Baseline Depressive Symptoms via Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in depressive symptoms will be measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess depressive symptoms. With total scores ranging from 0 to 27, scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. The PHQ-9 has factorial validity for the diagnosis of major depressive disorder.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Caregiver Burden via Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in caregiver burden will be measured using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). This two-factor, 22-item scale measures personal strain and role strain in caregiving by summing responses to a total score (0-20 little or no burden; 21-40 mild to moderate burden; 41-60 moderate to severe burden; and 61-88 severe burden). The ZBI measures change over time resulting from the progression of the patient's symptoms or from interventions aimed at reducing burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Wellbeing via Experience of Suffering Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in wellbeing will be measured using the Experience of Suffering Scale (ESS). With prior testing in ADRD caregivers, the ESS contains 33 items across 3 subscales: physical (9 items), psychological (15 items), and existential (9 items) suffering. Total scores for each subscale are calculated with higher scores indicating more suffering within each domain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Coping via Brief COPE</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in coping will be measured with the 28-item Brief COPE, a measure of coping strategies used in response to stressors. Comprised of 28 coping strategies, the Brief COPE contains 14 two-item subscales, each analyzed separately: self-distraction, active coping, denial, substance use, use of emotional support, use of instrumental support, venting, behavioral disengagement, positive reframing, planning, humor, acceptance, religion, and self-blame.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Psychological Flexibility via Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in psychological flexibility and its opposite, experiential avoidance, will be measured using the 7-item Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II). Respondents rate how true each statement (e.g., &quot;It is okay if I remember something unpleasant&quot;) is for them on a 7-point Likert-type scale anchored from 1=never true to 7=always true. Higher scores indicate greater psychological flexibility or acceptance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Quality of Life via PROMIS Global Health measure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in quality of life will be assessed with the 10-item PROMIS Global Health measure. On a 5-point scale, participants rate their mental and physical well-being with higher scores indicative of better health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Anticipatory Grief via Anticipatory Grief Scale (AGS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention (7-9 weeks post-baseline), 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in anticipatory grief will be measured with the Anticipatory Grief Scale (AGS), a 27-item self-report tool designed to assess the bereavement experience of dementia caregivers. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale with responses ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention feasibility: accrual rate</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the number of eligibly-screened caregivers who choose to consent and enroll in the trial. This accrual outcome speaks to intervention feasibility.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention feasibility: attendance rate</measure>
    <time_frame>post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the total number of sessions that participants allocated to TACTICs attend (i.e., out of 6 sessions possible). This attendance outcome speaks to intervention feasibility.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention feasibility: retention rate</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the number of enrolled subjects completing the final outcome assessment at 6 months post-intervention. This retention outcome speaks to intervention feasibility.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess intervention acceptability using a brief investigator-created battery of quantitative and qualitative satisfaction items.</description>
