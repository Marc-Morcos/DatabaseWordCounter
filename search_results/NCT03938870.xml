    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and currently has no disease&#xD;
      modifying treatments or simple accurate diagnostic tests. The goal of this project is to&#xD;
      study how tau (a protein thought to cause AD) is made, transported and cleared in the human&#xD;
      body. Better understanding of these processes may lead to improved understanding of AD,&#xD;
      earlier diagnosis and a way to evaluate treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine how tau works in the Human Central Nervous System&#xD;
      (CNS)and to test the hypothesis, that tau is altered (i.e. increased production, decreased&#xD;
      clearance, and increased collection rate) with age, and in diseases caused by the disruption&#xD;
      of how tau usually works. We will first test this hypothesis in AD and then test and compare&#xD;
      other tau diseases in future studies. We have recently developed a novel approach to measure&#xD;
      tau in the human CNS. We propose to utilize this approach to address fundamental questions of&#xD;
      human tau production and metabolism in Alzheimer's disease. Researchers have designed this&#xD;
      study to determine how long tau stays in the body. It involves labeling or marking tau with a&#xD;
      special type of an essential amino acid called leucine. Our bodies naturally get leucine from&#xD;
      the foods that we eat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the participant will either be given labeled leucine through intravenous&#xD;
      infusion, or be given labeled leucine in a drink. The researchers think that it would be more&#xD;
      convenient for the participant if the study was done giving the leucine by infusion but this&#xD;
      method has not been tested with tau. The first part of the study is to test the infusion&#xD;
      method and find the optimal infusion rate and length of time to hopefully see tau. If the&#xD;
      method cannot be confirmed with the young normal control group the study will move on to&#xD;
      using the oral method of labeling. This has been proven to work but it will be more&#xD;
      burdensome for the participants. The leucine is a stable form of carbon found in nature and&#xD;
      has no side effects but it will stick to certain proteins such as tau making the tau&#xD;
      &quot;visible&quot; to researchers. Once labeled, the researchers will take samples of Cerebral Spinal&#xD;
      Fluid (CSF) at different time points and determine how long the tau stays in the system. This&#xD;
      amount of time is called the &quot;half-life&quot;. Knowing the half-life of tau will help researchers&#xD;
      to develop clinical trials that target tau and future therapeutic interventions for AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first type of labeling is Intravenous Infusion of Leucine. After successful screening,&#xD;
      the subject would come to the CARS at 07:00 AM, (fasting from 10:00 PM the night before), and&#xD;
      have an intravenous catheter placed. The researchers do not know exactly how much Leucine it&#xD;
      will take to successfully label Tau so that they can see it. The first studies will be with&#xD;
      Young Normal controls ages 18 and older. The researcher will test the following amounts of&#xD;
      leucine; Leucine infusion for 24 hours at a rate of 4 mg/kg/hour. The researchers will&#xD;
      process the samples immediately. If tau is visible at this amount a second participant will&#xD;
      receive a lesser infusion time, leucine infusion for 16 hours at a rate of 4mg/kg/hour. The&#xD;
      researchers will process the samples immediately, if tau is visible at this amount a third&#xD;
      participant will receive a lesser amount of leucine to label tau. Leucine infusion at a rate&#xD;
      of 2/mg/kg/hour for 24 hours. The samples will be tested and if the tau is seen at this&#xD;
      amount then a lesser amount of infusion time will be tried. The leucine infusion will be done&#xD;
      at at rate of 2/mg/kg/hour for 16 hours. This would be the goal of the study to infuse the&#xD;
      least amount of leucine for the least amount of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All meals are prepared by the Research Kitchen. When receiving leucine the participant has to&#xD;
      have their meals controlled for the natural leucine found in our diets. The participant&#xD;
      receives three meals and three snacks in the 24 hours and then a BJC cafeteria breakfast&#xD;
      after their first lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the amount and time of leucine infusion is optimal more Young Normal Controls will&#xD;
      repeat the infusion study for confirmation. Each participant will complete a total of 5&#xD;
      Lumbar Punctures over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the infusion method is not capable of showing adequate levels of tau the study will move&#xD;
      on to the Oral method of labelling. Participants will come to the Research Kitchen on day one&#xD;
      to pick up meals for two days, leucine for two days, as well as a diet diary. Participants&#xD;
      will receive a great deal of explanation and support as this method is burdensome because of&#xD;
      the visits, three days a week to pick up their food, as well as needing to mix, and drink&#xD;
      leucine in Kool-Aid 3 times a day for 10 days, and keep a diet diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants are labeled the Lumbar Punctures are performed. The Infusion and the Oral&#xD;
      method each have a schedule of Lumbar Puncture days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundamental questions of tau kinetics and processing have not been addressed in humans. There&#xD;
      has been no reliable technique to measure in vivo tau metabolism. Questions such as 1)what is&#xD;
      the half-life of tau in the human central nervous system (CNS), 2)is cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF) tau increased due to over-production or under-clearance, 3)are tau kinetics altered in&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and 4)how much should tau be modulated by drugs which target tau&#xD;
      have not been addressed to date in humans. We propose to apply a recently developed tau&#xD;
      stable isotope labeling kinetics (SILK) method to measure tau kinetics in AD patients and&#xD;
      age-matched cognitively normal controls to determine physiological and pathophysiological&#xD;
      changes in tau metabolism. We hypothesize that tau production will be increased in AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To measure physiological tau kinetics with the tau SILK method in the CNS of normal&#xD;
      human participants and determine the effects of age. (a) We will quantify in vivo CNS tau&#xD;
      SILK kinetics of 10 YNCs (Age 18-64) and determine the physiological kinetics of human tau.&#xD;
      (b) We hypothesize that tau half-life and clearance are slowed with increasing age. Tau&#xD;
      kinetics under normal physiological conditions will be compared across different age groups.&#xD;
      The participants with normal CSF tau concentrations and normal tau PET imaging results from&#xD;
      10 age-matched controls (age 65 and greater) from Aim 2 will be included in the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine pathological changes in tau kinetics in AD dementia. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      soluble tau production is increased in AD with subsequent increase in aggregation rates and&#xD;
      irreversible loss of soluble tau. We will examine the kinetics of CNS tau in 10 participants&#xD;
      with late-onset AD dementia and 10 cognitively normal age-matched controls (age 65 and&#xD;
      greater).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this tau SILK study will help elucidate the dynamic kinetics of human CNS tau in&#xD;
      physiology and pathophysiology of tauopathies. The tau SILK method will facilitate future&#xD;
      efforts to evaluate the efficacy of tau-targeted therapies and help effectively design future&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that amyloid beta and tau contribute to the&#xD;
      pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease(AD). Tau cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      levels correlate with cognitive decline in AD, but currently we have little knowledge of tau&#xD;
      metabolism in humans as no prior method could test the hypothesis that kinetics of tau are&#xD;
      altered in disease. We pioneered the Stable Isotope Labeling Kinetics (SILK) to determine&#xD;
      Abeta; kinetics and demonstrated increased Abeta42 production in mutation carriers of early&#xD;
      onset AD and decreased Abeta; clearance in sporadic AD. We now propose to use recently&#xD;
      developed tau SILK method to determine the tau kinetics in human central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS). Previous studies using mouse models suggest that tau is a slow turnover protein with a&#xD;
      half-life of approximately 2 weeks. It is also less abundant compared to Abeta; however, we&#xD;
      have utilized sensitive mass spectrometry method to detect and measure labeled tau in human&#xD;
      CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitation of the physiological and pathological kinetics of tau in this proposal will be&#xD;
      crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of AD and other tauopathies. For example,&#xD;
      questions such as 'why is tau increased in AD CSF - overproduction or impaired clearance?'&#xD;
      need to be addressed to guide therapeutic targeting. By quantifying the changes in tau&#xD;
      production and clearance, better estimates of target engagement can be made. The tau SILK&#xD;
      method will be an invaluable tool in future studies to determine the pathophysiology of tau&#xD;
      in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Progressive&#xD;
      supranuclear palsy (PSP), and Frontotempral Dementia (FTD)) and to evaluate potential drug&#xD;
      candidates and genetic manipulations which target Tau. A combination of the tau SILK protocol&#xD;
      and a novel tau PET (T807) imaging allows us to examine in-depth the in vivo human soluble&#xD;
      and aggregate tau dynamics.&#xD;
