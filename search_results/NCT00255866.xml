  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assisted living is rapidly becoming one of the most common methods of caring for older adults&#xD;
      with dementia in long-term care. Over half of assisted living residents have dementia and&#xD;
      many exhibit affective and behavioral problems related to the condition; residents' care and&#xD;
      quality of life may suffer as a result of these problems. Despite the seriousness of this&#xD;
      condition, interventions to teach direct care staff how to care for these residents are&#xD;
      limited. This study will develop a program for teaching assisted living staff how to deal&#xD;
      with the issues of patients with dementia and reduce mood and behavioral problems among this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers will be randomly assigned to attend skills training sessions as two 4-hour&#xD;
      workshops, four 30 minute individual training sessions, or two 30 minute in-services.&#xD;
      Training will focus on dementia, depression and anxiety, the incidence of behavior problems,&#xD;
      and skills and techniques for alleviating care challenges associated with behavior problems.&#xD;
      Caregivers will complete self-report scales and questionnaires at the beginning and at the&#xD;
      end of the study; these measures will assess job satisfaction, reactions to resident&#xD;
      behavioral problems, and job skills. Residents will also be recruited for this study; they&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires about their depressive episodes, anxiety, behavioral problems,&#xD;
      and quality of life at the beginning and at the end of the study.&#xD;
