    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center longitudinal study that consists of five cohorts: cognitive normal&#xD;
      aging (CN), Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI),&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). The goals of this study are&#xD;
      as follow: 1.To establish longitudinal cohort study database containing comprehensive&#xD;
      epidemiological data, neuropsychological test data, laboratory parameters, image data and&#xD;
      biological samples. 2. To determine the risk factors of AD and other dementias. 3. To explore&#xD;
      the conversion rates from CN to SCI, MCI or AD and the risk factors as well as biomarkers for&#xD;
      the progression from CN to SCI, MCI or AD. 4. To explore and validate blood, CSF, urine,&#xD;
      imaging and other biomarkers for the early detection and progression of AD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As the population ages in China, the number of patients with neurocognitive disorders such as&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is steadily increasing. The&#xD;
      burden of cognitive impairment in China has been an important public health problem. Cohort&#xD;
      study on aging and cognitive impairment is urgent to better understand and address this&#xD;
      issue. Early prevention, diagnosis and treatment are critical for reduction the burden of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. In this prospective study, subjects will be recruited into one of the&#xD;
      five groups based on inclusion and exclusion criteria: 1) CN, 2) MCI 3) AD and 4) VCI. Each&#xD;
      of the subjects will be followed up at designated time points up to 5 years. Epidemiological&#xD;
      data, medical, imaging (MRI and PET scans), genetic information and various biological&#xD;
      samples will be collected during the baseline and follow-up period.&#xD;
