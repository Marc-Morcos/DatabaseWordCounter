    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research project is to study how seizure-like activity affects the&#xD;
      blood flow in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Changes in blood flow can&#xD;
      change memory and thinking ability, as happens in Alzheimer's disease. The investigators are&#xD;
      using a study drug called Levetiracetam, which helps control seizure-like activity to see if&#xD;
      it can help change the abnormal blood flow in the brain that is seen in some people with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects will make four separate visits to BIDMC. Subject will come to the Clinical Research&#xD;
      Center. All of the visits will take around 5 hours apiece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects agree to be in this study, subjects will be asked to read and sign the consent&#xD;
      form. After subjects sign the consent form, the following things will happen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Procedures: Screening procedures are tests and procedures that will be done to&#xD;
           determine if subjects are eligible to take part in the research study. For this research&#xD;
           study, the screening procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A thorough medical history. Investigators will ask if subjects have any medical&#xD;
                problems. Investigators will ask about subjects Alzheimer's disease and if they&#xD;
                have had any seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A physical examination. Investigators will take your blood pressure and your heart&#xD;
                rate. They will examine your heart and lungs and take your height and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigators will also assess the subject's nervous system. Investigators will&#xD;
                examine subject's speech, memory, strength, coordination, and reflexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigators will ask you to take some paper and pencil tests. This will help us&#xD;
                to understand your memory and mood&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects will have a blood test to check how your kidneys are functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects may have already had some of these tests done by their doctor when they were&#xD;
           diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The information we learned will help to decide whether subjects could join the study.&#xD;
           Investigators will explain the reason if they decide subjects should not join the study.&#xD;
           Our decision does NOT mean that subjects have a health problem or disorder .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomization Procedures: Investigators will meet with one of the study doctors if&#xD;
           subjects continue in the study. The study doctor will explain to subjects when they are&#xD;
           expected to come to the research center for study testing or to take the study drug.&#xD;
           Subjects will come to the BIDMC Clinical Research Center for three visits. These visits&#xD;
           will occur within one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All study participants will receive the same study drugs over the three (3) visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects will receive levetiracetam, the study drug, in a low dose, 2.5 milligrams&#xD;
                for each kilogram of body weight, at one visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects will receive levetiracetam, the study drug, in a high dose, 7.5 milligrams&#xD;
                for each kilogram of body weight, at one visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects will receive a placebo at one visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A placebo is an inactive injection that looks like the study drug, but a placebo&#xD;
           contains no active medication. In this study, the placebo is a saline (sterile salt&#xD;
           water) injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sometimes study results are truly due to the study medication. Sometimes the study&#xD;
           results are not due to the study medication. Investigators are using a placebo to help&#xD;
           us understand the reason for the results in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The order of the above visits will not be the same for all study participants. There are&#xD;
           six different orders to receive the study drugs. For example, subjects could receive the&#xD;
           placebo at the first visit, the high dose of levetiracetam at the second visit, and the&#xD;
           low dose of levetiracetam at the third visit. Another example is that subjects could&#xD;
           receive the low dose at the first visit, the placebo at the second visit, and the high&#xD;
           dose at the third visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Deciding the order in which you get the study drugs will be done by to a method called&#xD;
           &quot;randomization.&quot; Randomization means that a computer will assign patients to study drugs&#xD;
           in a random manner, like flipping a coin. Another way to say randomization is &quot;by&#xD;
           chance.&quot; When you flip a coin, you get heads or tails by chance. The chance of getting&#xD;
           any dose of study drug or placebo is about equal. After the randomization, Subjects will&#xD;
           be assigned to get one study drug or placebo at each visit. Subjects will not be able to&#xD;
           choose which study drug you will get at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will not know which study drug dose or placebo will be given at a visit. The&#xD;
           study doctor will not know which study drug dose or placebo will be given at a visit.&#xD;
           The study doctor can find out this information quickly if there is an emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research Procedures: Subjects will come to the BIDMC Clinical Research Center three&#xD;
           times if they continue in this study. A member of the study team will meet subjects when&#xD;
           they arrive. Subjects will first have an intravenous catheter (also called an IV) put&#xD;
           into a vein. A nurse will check blood pressure and heart rate. Subjects will have a&#xD;
           brief physical exam and a nervous system exam by a doctor&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will then have an electroencephalogram (EEG). An EEG gives investigators&#xD;
           information about the nervous system - specifically the brain. Subjects will have their&#xD;
           scalp cleaned with alcohol and small discs - called electrodes - placed on the scalp&#xD;
           using gel. Then the head will be will be wrapped with gauze to. keep the discs from&#xD;
           moving. The discs will be attached by wires to an EEG machine. The EEG machine will be&#xD;
           at the bedside and will give investigators information about the electrical activity in&#xD;
           the brain. Subjects will need to lie quietly with eyes closed during the one hour that&#xD;
           the EEG machine is attached. Investigators will clean the gel from hair and skin when&#xD;
           the EEG is over.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigators will give subjects either levetiracetam -- the study drug -- or placebo&#xD;
           while subjects are having EEG. Investigators will give subjects the study drug or&#xD;
           placebo through the intravenous catheter (&quot;IV&quot;) in the arm. This will take around 20 to&#xD;
           30 minutes. The subjects nurse will take the subject's blood pressure and heart rate two&#xD;
           times while the study drug is being given to the subject and again after it is finished.&#xD;
           The subject will note any side effects they have during this time and after.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will then review what will happen during the MRI scan with the Investigator.&#xD;
           The MRI study will be conducted at the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Center of the&#xD;
           Department of Radiology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The MRI is a method of taking pictures of the brain and of the blood flow in the brain,&#xD;
           using a large magnet and radio signals. Subjects will be asked to lie down on a platform&#xD;
           that can be slid into the magnet. An MRI imaging coil, which is made from special wires&#xD;
           that are covered in plastic, will be placed around the head. Foam pads will be placed&#xD;
           around the head to limit head movement during the scan. During the scan, subjects will&#xD;
           be asked to lie still on their back for about 45 to 60 minutes. They will hear a loud&#xD;
           knocking or hammering noise while the MRI is taking pictures, but the process itself&#xD;
           will be painless. They will be given disposable earplugs to use to help lessen the&#xD;
           noise. During the procedure, subjects will be in constant contact with the MRI&#xD;
           technician through an intercom. If at any time during the scan you feel too&#xD;
           uncomfortable to continue, no matter what the reason, the study will be immediately&#xD;
           stopped and subjects will be removed from the magnet (MRI Scanner).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will return to the Clinical Research Center after the MRI. They will take a few&#xD;
           pencil-and-paper tests for about one hour. These tests will tell the investigator about&#xD;
           memory and mood. They will also learn about your attention skills. Investigators will&#xD;
           also learn about the subjects= language skills and &quot;handedness&quot; (a tendency to favor&#xD;
           right or left hand).&#xD;
&#xD;
           As the medication (levetiracetam) may make the subject drowsy, they will not be able to&#xD;
           drive. Someone will need to accompany them to and from the hospital for the three study&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The second and third study visits will have the same sequence of events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SUMMARIES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Here is a summary of the Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening visit / informed consent Review your medical history. Brief physical and&#xD;
           neurological exam. Paper and pencil tests. Blood drawn to check the functioning of&#xD;
           kidneys. Review and sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Here are summaries of the three Study Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit One&#xD;
&#xD;
           :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vital signs. 2 minutes Brief physical and neurological exam. 10 minutes An intravenous&#xD;
           catheter placed in your arm. 5 minutes EEG. 60 minutes Intravenous dose of the&#xD;
           medication, levetiracetam, or placebo. 20 minutes MRI scan. 60 minutes Paper and pencil&#xD;
           tests. 60 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Visit Two: (This visit will occur one to two (1-2 )weeks after Study Visit One)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vital signs. 2 minutes Brief physical and neurological exam. 10 minutes Intravenous&#xD;
           catheter placed in your arm. 5 minutes EEG. 60 minutes Intravenous dose of the&#xD;
           medication, levetiracetam, or placebo. 20 minutes MRI scan. 60 minutes Paper and pencil&#xD;
           tests. 60 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Visit Three: (This visit will occur one to two (1-2 )weeks after Study Visit Two)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vital signs. 2 minutes Physical and neurological exam. 10 minutes Intravenous catheter&#xD;
           placed in your arm. 5 minutes EEG. 60 minutes Intravenous dose of the medication,&#xD;
           levetiracetam, or placebo. 20 minutes MRI scan. 60 minutes Paper and pencil tests. 60&#xD;
           minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each visit will take a total of approximately 5 hours. This includes the time for the&#xD;
           EEG, MRI imaging and neuropsychological tests. Subjects will be allowed time to rest&#xD;
           between activities on a bed if they become tired. The CRC staff will serve lunch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Monitoring/Follow-Up Procedures. Procedures performed to evaluate the effectiveness and&#xD;
           safety of the research procedures are called &quot;monitoring&quot; or &quot;follow-up&quot; procedures.&#xD;
           Subject follow-up procedure will be a phone call from the study doctor one week after&#xD;
           the third visit. They will ask if any side effects from the study or study medication&#xD;
           occurred&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing: If subjects are enrolled into the study following the initial screening visit, each&#xD;
      of the three study visits will be separated by 2-3 week intervals. Therefore, the entire&#xD;
      study will last approximately 6-9 weeks.&#xD;
