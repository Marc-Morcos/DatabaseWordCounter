  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of eliciting continuous&#xD;
      narrative speech in different neurodegenerative and psychiatric indications, using remote,&#xD;
      self-administered speech tasks, as measured by the average length of speech elicitation for&#xD;
      each speech task during the first week of self-assessment. Secondary objectives include (1)&#xD;
      evaluating the reliability of speech tasks in the remote self-administered setting, as&#xD;
      measured by the intra- and inter-subject variance; (2) accessing the adherence of speech&#xD;
      tasks in this setting, as measured by the subject average fraction of days during the first&#xD;
      week, where at least one task response is submitted; (3) evaluating the feasibility of using&#xD;
      speech tasks in the setting of a telemedicine videoconference, as measured by the average&#xD;
      length of speech elicited in each group; (4) evaluate whether a set of acoustic and&#xD;
      linguistic patterns can detect each indication, compare to either a control group or all&#xD;
      other indications, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve&#xD;
      (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and Cohen's kappa of the relevant binary classifier; (5)&#xD;
      evaluating how the performance of such algorithms can be impacted by speaker and environment&#xD;
      covariates, as measured by the Kendall rank correlation coefficient of the AUC of each&#xD;
      classifier and each of age group, gender and speech-to-reverberation modulation energy ratio.&#xD;
