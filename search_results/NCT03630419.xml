  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diet plays a large role in inflammation, oxidative stress and cognition; however, every&#xD;
      person's body type, resting metabolic rate, BMI, and inflammation levels vary. Through&#xD;
      performing physiological and comprehensive cellular testing through bio-impedance, allows&#xD;
      this study to create personalized diet plans for each subject's body type. Cellular repair&#xD;
      therapy has also been known to improve cellular health and inflammation. Through decreasing&#xD;
      inflammation and improving oxidative stress, cognition in those with MCI and AD could&#xD;
      improve.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Even though AD has been associated with specific hallmarks, multiple etiologies have been&#xD;
      suggested to be prominent in the pathogenesis of the disease. Chronic inflammation, metabolic&#xD;
      dysfunction, oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage have all been linked to the incidence&#xD;
      and progression of neurodegeneration, negatively impacting overall prognosis of AD.&#xD;
      Currently, only a handful of FDA approved Alzheimer's medications are on the market; yet,&#xD;
      these medications are known to only treat symptoms associated with AD, not the underlying&#xD;
      causes. There are currently no medications FDA approved for MCI and predicting who will&#xD;
      progress onto AD is unknown. Unfortunately, in the last decade alone, several clinical trials&#xD;
      in MCI and AD, have been terminated prior to study conclusion, due to lack of efficacy and/or&#xD;
      poor study design. Even if an experimental drug is shown to be promising in early stages of&#xD;
      testing, it could take up to another 10-15 years before it is FDA approved and made&#xD;
      commercially available. Therefore, the need to find a therapy that could possibly prevent&#xD;
      people with MCI from developing AD is imperative. Through studying different etiologies,&#xD;
      providing a specialized diet based on each subject's individual physiological results and&#xD;
      improving mitochondria through cell repair therapy, not only can be quickly implemented into&#xD;
      the life of a person with cognitive impairment, but could possibly decrease the prevalence&#xD;
      and slow disease progression of AD. Thus, the fundamental research of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if such etiologies are measurable in patients with MCI and AD through body&#xD;
      composition and cellular health testing that could lead to proper and novel treatments to&#xD;
      combat the diseases. This study was conducted in hopes of determining that chronic&#xD;
      inflammation and other risk factors for MCI and AD such as oxidative stress and metabolic&#xD;
      dysfunction, can be ameliorated, improve cognitive function, and therefore prevent disease&#xD;
      progression through effective, non-drug therapies.&#xD;
