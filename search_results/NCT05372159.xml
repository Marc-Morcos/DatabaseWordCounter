      This study will use an observational cohort to cross-sectionally and longitudinally relate&#xD;
      vascular health to clinical, imaging, and biological markers of early Alzheimer's disease and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease among aging adults. Adjusting for relevant clinical covariates, we&#xD;
      will test the hypothesis that vascular health is associated with clinical, brain magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI), neuropsychological, and cerebrospinal fluid markers of early&#xD;
      cerebrovascular and Alzheimer's disease changes (i.e., prior to the onset of significant&#xD;
      cognitive decline or dementia). Secondarily, we will examine medical and genetic factors that&#xD;
      might mediate associations between vascular health and brain aging, such as inflammatory&#xD;
      processes, insulin resistance, and genetic factors (e.g., APOE, a susceptibility risk factor&#xD;
      for dementia). Findings will advance knowledge regarding the role that vascular health plays&#xD;
      in brain aging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the population ages, Alzheimer's disease and dementia are becoming a public health crisis.&#xD;
      In the initial cycle, the Vanderbilt Memory &amp; Aging Project was established to examine&#xD;
      cardiovascular function in relation to structural neuroimaging changes and cognition. The&#xD;
      investigators tested whether associations were more prominent in clinically symptomatic&#xD;
      individuals. The investigators successfully enrolled several hundred participants age 60 and&#xD;
      older, data successfully supported multiple training grant opportunities (e.g., National&#xD;
      Research Service Awards, Career Development Awards), and the investigators published numerous&#xD;
      papers. The results suggest subclinical cardiovascular changes relate to worse cognition,&#xD;
      white matter changes, and cerebral atrophy, especially in the hippocampus and other cortical&#xD;
      regions primarily affected in Alzheimer's disease. Evidence to date supports the central&#xD;
      hypothesis that well-established homeostatic mechanisms designed to protect cerebral blood&#xD;
      supply become less effective with age, altering the integrity of cerebral hemodynamics, and&#xD;
      lowering the threshold for neurodegenerative and cognitive changes. Interestingly,&#xD;
      preliminary associations between subclinical cardiovascular integrity and cerebral&#xD;
      hemodynamics are stronger among carriers of the apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE-ε4) allele, an&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease genetic risk factor. Furthermore, findings are more prominent in&#xD;
      cognitively unimpaired participants, suggesting subtle cardiac hemodynamic changes may act as&#xD;
      an underrecognized precipitating contributor of neurodegeneration and corresponding cognitive&#xD;
      decline, distinct from the exacerbating effects of overt cerebrovascular disease. In the next&#xD;
      cycle, the investigators propose to better characterize underlying mechanisms linking early&#xD;
      cardiac hemodynamic changes to abnormal brain aging in cognitively unimpaired participants,&#xD;
      and test whether APOE-ε4 moderates the effect of vascular damage on brain health. The&#xD;
      investigators will follow the existing cohort and supplement it with enrollment of several&#xD;
      hundred cognitively unimpaired participants to increase statistical power for more&#xD;
      comprehensive analyses. The new participants will complete serial longitudinal assessments&#xD;
      with identical procedures plus lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid acquisition.&#xD;
      Innovative translational efforts leveraging sophisticated neuroimaging and molecular&#xD;
      biomarkers are critical to better detect early, asymptomatic cardiac hemodynamic changes,&#xD;
      which may be more influential in initiating downstream cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative&#xD;
      processes than previously recognized.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants recruited will include 1,000 adults age 50 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After the eligibility visit, a small portion of participants (~150) enrolling must&#xD;
             meet diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment according to a clinician&#xD;
             diagnosis and/or medical records (i.e., participants must have mild memory or&#xD;
             cognitive problems, but they must be free of any functional problems and not have&#xD;
             Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia). The remaining ~850 participants will&#xD;
             be cognitively unimpaired adults age 50 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because the neuropsychological tests used to measure cognitive performance are&#xD;
             validated on English-speaking populations, we require that English be the primary&#xD;
             language of all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No available reliable study partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of major psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar), neurological&#xD;
             illness (e.g., stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, dementia),&#xD;
             or head injury with significant loss of consciousness. These exclusion criteria have&#xD;
             been applied because they affect brain structure and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or other heart arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of cancer (current)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of serious alcohol or drug abuse (past or current)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants unable to undergo MRI will be excluded. Reasons may include: a. Subjects&#xD;
             who have any type of bioimplant activated by mechanical, electronic, or magnetic means&#xD;
             (e.g., cochlear implants, pacemakers, neurostimulators, biostimulators, electronic&#xD;
             infusion pumps, etc.). b. Subjects who have any type of ferromagnetic bioimplant that&#xD;
             could potentially be displaced. c. Subjects who have cerebral aneurysm clips. d.&#xD;
             Subjects who may have shrapnel imbedded in their bodies (e.g., from war wounds), metal&#xD;
             workers and machinists (e.g., potential for metallic fragments in or near the eyes).&#xD;
             e. Subjects who are pregnant. Given that the minimum age of recruitment for the&#xD;
             current study is 50 years of age, it is unlikely that prospective participants will be&#xD;
             excluded because of pregnancy. f. Subjects who have excessive amounts of metal dental&#xD;
             work based on records released by their dentist.&#xD;
