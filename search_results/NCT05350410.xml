  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This initial four-months pilot study will focus on at least three educational courses&#xD;
      (introduction to dementia and lifestyle risk factors, sleep and diet). It may also include a&#xD;
      fourth educational course on social connectivity and loneliness. Completion of this initial&#xD;
      pilot study will allow for a round of improvements informed by data from the program, on&#xD;
      usability, as well as feedback from participants and citizen advisors. This will allow for an&#xD;
      iterative process to build the program to its full content, with feedback to optimize the&#xD;
      user experience and ensure the accessibility of the content. The information generated from&#xD;
      this study will help inform the development of the second program's prototype, expected to&#xD;
      benefit from the initial pilot to become more user-friendly, effective and accessible to the&#xD;
      target audience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will be a longitudinal study of an inception cohort exposed to the HALT-AD&#xD;
      online educational program for a four-month study. It will utilize pre- and post-&#xD;
      intervention collection of quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the program's first&#xD;
      prototype.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Healthy Actions and Lifestyles to Avoid Dementia or Hispanos y el ALTo a la Demencia program&#xD;
      (HALT- AD) is a novel bilingual educational program that will focus on reducing risk factors&#xD;
      with the ultimate goal of preventing dementia. It will be centered around a web-based&#xD;
      interactive virtual online platform that will be developed to be dynamic, engaging, and&#xD;
      interactive. Through interactive courses, the educational content of HALT-AD will provide&#xD;
      guidance on modifiable lifestyle risk factors and the identification of treatable medical&#xD;
      conditions including cerebrovascular health, sleep, sensory loss, social isolation, mood,&#xD;
      diet, and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in HALT-AD will be provided with personalized risk profiles, will be encouraged&#xD;
      to learn about risk factors and how they can effectively modify them, and will be provided&#xD;
      with feedback on their progress. Participants will participate in facilitated support&#xD;
      discussion groups, which will focus on the content of the educational material and the&#xD;
      invocation of change through participant engagement and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to launching the full HALT-AD program, it is essential that the Sponsor conduct a&#xD;
      preliminary pilot study to evaluate the program's first prototype. At the end of the 3-month&#xD;
      pilot program, evaluations will include: the usability of- and engagement with- the online&#xD;
      platform and users' acceptability of the learning content and facilitated support discussion&#xD;
      groups. As well as evaluating preliminary evidence on the effectiveness of the program in&#xD;
      changing knowledge, self-efficacy, and dementia-related lifestyle risk factors. The program&#xD;
      will also be evaluated on metrics such as being user friendly, engaging, supportive and&#xD;
      communicative, with the potential for scalability to state- and national-levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the usability of, and engagement with, the online platform&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine users' acceptability of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. HALT AD program content&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. facilitated support discussion groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate preliminary evidence on the effectiveness of the program in changing&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. knowledge,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. self-efficacy, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. dementia-related lifestyle risk factors.&#xD;

Additionally, users will be asked one additional question &quot;&quot;How likely is it that you would recommend HALT-AD to a friend or colleague?&quot; on a scale of -100 (extremely unlikely) to +100 (extremely likely).</description>

    <description>Prior studies have shown that programs that focus on promoting brain health and managing lifestyle risks (such as poor diet, obesity, physical inactivity, sleep issues, loneliness) may help in preventing or lowering the risk of dementia. To address this, we have developed the HALT-AD program. HALT-AD is an educational program designed to teach about dementia and lifestyle changes that can help preserve brain health and lower dementia risk</description>
