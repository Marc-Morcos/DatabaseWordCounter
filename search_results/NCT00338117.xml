  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of a relatively high&#xD;
      dose of galantamine, 32 mg /day in a three-times daily dosage, compared with placebo in&#xD;
      treating patients with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is a progressive degenerative brain disorder that affects memory, as well&#xD;
      as the ability to concentrate, reason, and think in abstract form. This study was designed to&#xD;
      examine the effectiveness and safety of galantamine (galant.) hydrobromide at a relatively&#xD;
      high dose, compared with treatment with placebo, in men and women with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
      Approximately 600 patients were screened. This was a double-blind study, i.e., neither&#xD;
      patients nor investigators knew what treatment was given. Before the start of the&#xD;
      double-blind phase, each patient was randomly assigned to receive either galantamine&#xD;
      hydrobromide or placebo (i.e., no active drug). The dose was increased weekly, at a higher&#xD;
      rate than currently recommended in the label, until the stable daily dose of 32 mg&#xD;
      galantamine was reached. All patients took their treatment (galantamine or placebo) 3 times a&#xD;
      day. All patients who completed the blinded phase of the study were permitted to enter an&#xD;
      open-label phase, in which the treatment was made known to both investigators and patients.&#xD;
      During this additional 24-week phase, all patients received treatment with galantamine&#xD;
      hydrobromide. The effectiveness of study treatment (galantamine hydrobromide or placebo) was&#xD;
      assessed using several measures and included the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score.&#xD;
      The MMSE consists of 12 questions and tasks designed to assess severity of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. Additional measures included the European Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale&#xD;
      cognitive score (EURO-ADAS-cog), a Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change (CIBIC)&#xD;
      plus, and the Nurses' Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients (NOSGER). Safety and&#xD;
      tolerability were assessed using physical (full and brief) examination, adverse events&#xD;
      reports, clinical and laboratory measures, and 12-lead ECG results. Galant. was taken orally&#xD;
      as a tablet 3 times a day with meals. Patients started their treatment with a total 8 mg of&#xD;
      galantamine. The dose was increased weekly to a daily cumulative dose of 32 mg (the same as&#xD;
      40 mg Gal HBr).This dose was higher and the titration schedule was 4 times more rapid that&#xD;
      the 16 mg and 24 mg maintenance doses and 4-weekly titration steps specified in the US label.&#xD;
      Each phase had a 5-week titration period. After 5 weeks, patients continued to receive 40 mg.&#xD;
