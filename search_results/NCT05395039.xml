  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of scheduled video/audio conferences by clinical navigators on the&#xD;
      experience of surrogate decision makers for hospitalized older adults with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD), delirium, and other causes of cognitive impairment. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to learn more about the experiences of surrogate decision makers of hospitalized older&#xD;
      adults when they cannot be physically present with the patient in the hospital. We will&#xD;
      conduct a randomized pilot study of virtual visits to connect the surrogate decision makers&#xD;
      of incapacitated, hospitalized older adults with AD, delirium, and related causes of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment with the patient and clinicians.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the COVID-19 pandemic exploded, hospitals across the globe completely excluded or severely&#xD;
      limited family visitors. Thousands of patients have faced life-threatening illness or died&#xD;
      without any loved ones at the bedside. Patients with AD were often unable to understand why&#xD;
      their family members could not be present, leading to increased agitation. The calming&#xD;
      presence that family often provide to hospitalized patients was missing. In addition to the&#xD;
      tragedy for patients, family members were forced to address decisions about life-sustaining&#xD;
      treatments without being able to see the patient or talk face to face with clinicians. As our&#xD;
      knowledge of coronavirus transmission expanded, visitor restrictions have been relaxed in&#xD;
      some cases but not eliminated. Urgent interventions are needed to mitigate the harm of these&#xD;
      restrictions. While the future is uncertain, COVID-19 cases are rising across the country,&#xD;
      suggesting that visitation will continue to be restricted. Additionally, our tertiary&#xD;
      referral center often admits patients from across the state, limiting the ability of family&#xD;
      members to be at the bedside. Harnessing virtual technologies has the potential to enhance&#xD;
      surrogate/clinician communication and decision making during the pandemic and after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telehealth has greatly expanded the abilities of patients to see clinicians remotely or for&#xD;
      clinician to clinician consultation, but prior to COVID-19 there were few interventions aimed&#xD;
      at the family members of hospitalized patients. We feel we are poised to rapidly move along&#xD;
      the NIH research pathway given that we are studying our early implementation. At the&#xD;
      conclusion of this pilot, we will then conduct an effectiveness trial, followed by an&#xD;
      embedded, pragmatic clinical trial.&#xD;
