      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers are interested in learning more about dementia and its causes. They want to&#xD;
      look at the genetic basis of dementia. Identifying genetic aspects of dementia may help&#xD;
      provide better tests and treatments for it. It may also show rare gene variants that can&#xD;
      cause or alter a person's risks for developing dementia. This study will look at people who&#xD;
      have dementia, their family members, and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study genetic influences on dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals who have been diagnosed with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family members of individuals who have been diagnosed with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be interviewed and answer questions about their medical history. They&#xD;
           will also provide general information on the relatives' medical histories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a blood sample for genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will remain on the study for up to 10 years. They will have regular visits&#xD;
           to monitor their brain health and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Dementia is a condition of declining mental abilities, especially memory. Dementia can occur&#xD;
      at any age but becomes more frequent with age, with a prevalence of 5%-10% in people over 65&#xD;
      and 20% in people over 80. Dementia affects the rate of information processing, short term&#xD;
      memory is affected before long term memory. It is difficult to diagnose between even the&#xD;
      three most common types: Alzheimers disease, Lewy Body disease and multi infarct dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically complex and heterogeneous disorder. It is the most&#xD;
      common form of dementia, accounting for about 50-70% of typical, late onset cases of&#xD;
      dementia. To date, mutations in three genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) have been described to cause&#xD;
      familial early-onset AD. In addition, a common polymorphism in the gene encoding&#xD;
      apolipoprotein E (APOE) has been associated with the more common late-onset form of the&#xD;
      disease. Genetic variability at the APOE locus is a major determinant of late onset Alzheimer&#xD;
      s disease. Recent estimates suggest that these four established genes account for less than&#xD;
      30% of the genetic variance in age of onset for AD and predict that numerous AD genes may&#xD;
      exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lewy Body Disease includes a range of disorders: Parkinson s Disease, Dementia with Lewy&#xD;
      bodies, and Parkinson s dementia, among others. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) accounts for&#xD;
      20% of all cases of dementia in old age. Clinically DLB is characterized by cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. Lewy bodies are neuronal inclusions&#xD;
      comprised of abnormally truncated and phosphorylated neurofilament proteins, alpha-synuclein,&#xD;
      ubiquitin and associated enzymes. Mutations in the alpha synuclein gene were first discovered&#xD;
      in 1996 in a family with autosomal dominant Lewy body parkinsonism. However, most lewy body&#xD;
      parkinsonism is not due to a variant in the alpha-synuclein gene. The importance of&#xD;
      alpha-synuclein is attributed to the finding of antibodies to alpha -synuclein stain Lewy&#xD;
      bodies in brains of all Lewy body disease cases. The ability to identify underlying genetic&#xD;
      influences that result in different synuclein pathologies is key to understanding these&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of this protocol is to collect families with a history of dementia in an&#xD;
      attempt to clone the causative gene defect(s) via linkage and positional cloning. Our&#xD;
      experience with the cloning of the Amyloid Precursor Protein mutations in Alzheimer s disease&#xD;
      shows that this approach leads to a better understanding of the biochemical and physiological&#xD;
      processes underlying the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clear there are numerous forms of dementia where disease does not appear to be&#xD;
      inherited in a Mendelian manner. Whilst these may be caused by environmental effects it is&#xD;
      also reasonable to hypothesize that disease may be caused by complex genetic interactions.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the susceptibility to environmental influence may be affected by genetic&#xD;
      predisposition. As a second aim in this protocol, we will investigate the association between&#xD;
      genetic polymorphisms and dementia. This will be performed by a candidate gene approach,&#xD;
      assessing the contribution of genes already associated with familial forms of disease, likely&#xD;
      candidates (for example involved in the cholinergic system, cell survival or Beta Amyloid&#xD;
      processing) or genes within a genetic region previously linked to disease. Although&#xD;
      significant association does not imply a causal relationship between the presence of the&#xD;
      variant and disease, the pathophysiologic significance should be studied further. The&#xD;
      inevitable problem of false positives within this type of analysis is a real one, which may&#xD;
      be addressed by independent replications and tightly controlled experiments. Undeniably the&#xD;
      analytical effort needed to differentiate positives from false positives is considerable, and&#xD;
      as can be readily seen in Alzheimer s disease, the literature is scattered with positive&#xD;
      associations and subsequent refutations. However, it is important that research groups&#xD;
      continue to identify and replicate these studies.&#xD;
