      Brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease may precede symptoms of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Dementia by over 20 years. The Investigators hope to be able to identify Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      at its very earliest stages when in theory treatments are most likely to be successful in&#xD;
      preventing further spread of the disease in the brain and causing dementia. The aim of EPAD&#xD;
      programme is to develop new treatments more quickly to prevent Alzheimer's dementia. A major&#xD;
      component of the EPAD programme is the EPAD Longitudinal Cohort Study which can provide&#xD;
      subjects for the EPAD trial as well as data to improve understanding of disease before&#xD;
      dementia develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will approach a broad range of people over the age of 50 who have&#xD;
      previously taken part in various research studies and consented to being recontacted for&#xD;
      further research. Participants will be asked questions to assess their memory and other&#xD;
      cognitive function. The participants will also undertake a brain scan, provide a sample of&#xD;
      spinal fluid, blood, urine and saliva to look at markers in these bodily fluids that may&#xD;
      change in Alzheimer's disease. The Investigators will then follow these participants until&#xD;
      December 2019 repeating these tests annually. This will be called the EPAD Longitudinal&#xD;
      Cohort Study (EPAD LCS). The main reasons for EPAD developing a cohort are to help the&#xD;
      Investigators understand more about what happens to people before dementia develops, and to&#xD;
      help recruit people more quickly into the EPAD trials of new medications or other&#xD;
      interventions expected to prevent dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People in the EPAD LCS may be invited to take part in the EPAD Proof of Concept prevention&#xD;
      studies to see if interventions can modify the probability of developing dementia or&#xD;
      cognitive problems (this will be subject to separate ethics approval and consent). Together&#xD;
      EPAD LCS and EPAD PoC make up the full EPAD Programme.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EPAD project has been established to overcome the major hurdles hampering drug&#xD;
      development for secondary prevention of AD dementia, by conducting the EPAD LCS (fed mainly&#xD;
      from existing Parent Cohorts (PC) across Europe) in alignment with the adaptive design EPAD&#xD;
      PoC trial. Both EPAD LCS and EPAD PoC trial will be run in an exclusive network of highly&#xD;
      selected, expert Trial Delivery Centres (TDC) that will be selected on the basis of strictly&#xD;
      applied criteria to ensure the highest possible data quality, successful recruitment and&#xD;
      adherence to the EPAD principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While interventions must start early in the course of AD, accurate disease models covering&#xD;
      the entire course of AD before dementia onset are lacking. Estimating with reasonable&#xD;
      confidence an individual's overall probability of developing AD dementia over a defined time&#xD;
      period must take into account multiple dimensions simultaneously (e.g. cognition, biomarkers,&#xD;
      traditional risk factors - genetic and environmental). This will allow any given individual&#xD;
      to be placed somewhere on a probability spectrum from negligible probability to high&#xD;
      probability. Because individuals with similar overall probability may have very different&#xD;
      contributions from various components in each dimension, flexible algorithms are needed&#xD;
      instead of simple cut-offs to identify a probability-spectrum population adequate for both&#xD;
      disease modelling and for providing a sufficient number of potential trial participants&#xD;
      (especially in adaptive trials with multiple arms testing drugs with different mechanisms of&#xD;
      action).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPAD LCS is designed to address the dual need for development of accurate longitudinal models&#xD;
      for AD covering the entire disease course, and development of adequate infrastructure for&#xD;
      facilitating identification of research participants and clinical trial recruitment. EPAD LCS&#xD;
      will have a probability-spectrum population selected mostly from already existing PCs across&#xD;
      Europe to facilitate fast recruitment. Different types of PCs will be considered (e.g. memory&#xD;
      clinic-based, population-based). Due to the variety of PCs, some EPAD LCS research&#xD;
      participants will be e.g. memory clinic patients without dementia, while others will be e.g.&#xD;
      participants without dementia from the general population. The variety of PC settings will&#xD;
      ensure that the EPAD LCS probability-spectrum population can cover the entire continuum of&#xD;
      probability for AD dementia development. Regular EPAD LCS follow-up with clinical, cognitive&#xD;
      and biomarker assessments will provide a well-phenotyped probability-spectrum population,&#xD;
      generating high-quality data for updating disease models, for easier identification of&#xD;
      individuals suitable for trial inclusion, and for use as trial run-in data and reference for&#xD;
      evaluating intervention efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The flow of research participants from the population at large to the trial is divided into&#xD;
      the following stages: firstly, EPAD will engage existing PCs from across Europe who may have&#xD;
      eligible research participants for the EPAD LCS. The next step is drawing research&#xD;
      participants from the PCs into the EPAD LCS to maintain a suitable population of&#xD;
      approximately 6,000 research participants. Recruitment will be complemented with research&#xD;
      participants who are recruited from a clinical setting by their referring clinician. To&#xD;
      enable access to the EPAD LCS for these potential participants, the referring clinician will&#xD;
      check if they match the flexible algorithm. Finally, research participants in the EPAD LCS&#xD;
      who fulfil trial inclusion criteria (approximately 1,500 research participants), will be&#xD;
      invited to enter the EPAD PoC (PoC) trial for evaluation of treatment for secondary&#xD;
      prevention of AD dementia. This trial is a standing, adaptive, PoC trial that could involve&#xD;
      multiple arms running concurrently. Successful graduation through PoC into phase 3&#xD;
      confirmatory trials of single or combinatorial interventions will be based on success against&#xD;
      an intermediary, target specific biomarker and then success against a cognitive measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once recruitment is completed, at any given time there should be approx. 6,000 research&#xD;
      participants in the EPAD LCS and approx. 1,500 in the EPAD PoC, hence the need to replenish&#xD;
      each from PCs as participants are lost through attrition. EPAD LCS will initially run until&#xD;
      the end of December 2019, and extension of consent will be sought after 4 years.&#xD;

        Research participants will mainly be recruited from existing Parent Cohorts (PC) across&#xD;
        Europe. PCs considered for EPAD are: active cohorts without dementia aged at least 50&#xD;
        years; the PC PI is willing to provide research participants for EPAD trials; with existing&#xD;
        consent for re-contact or possibility to obtain consent to re-contact. Potential research&#xD;
        participants will be identified based on data in the PC, using a flexible search algorithm&#xD;
        adapted to the types of data available in each PC. Recruitment will be complemented with&#xD;
        research participants who are recruited from a clinical setting by their referring&#xD;
        clinician. In case an individual or their referring clinician contacts a TDC, the referring&#xD;
        clinician will check the flexible algorithm to confirm their suitability.&#xD;
