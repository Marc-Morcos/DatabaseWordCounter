  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the ENACT (ENgaging in Advance Care planning Talks) Group Visit intervention&#xD;
      is to integrate a patient-centered advance care planning process into primary care,&#xD;
      ultimately helping patients to receive medical care that is aligned with their values. The&#xD;
      ENACT Group Visit intervention involves two group discussions about advance care planning&#xD;
      with 8-10 patients who meet for 2-hour sessions, one month apart, facilitated by a&#xD;
      geriatrician and a social worker. This study will compare the ENACT Group Visit intervention&#xD;
      to mailed advance care planning materials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot feasibility randomized controlled study will determine the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the ENACT Group Visit intervention compared to a&#xD;
      comparison arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ENACT Group Visit intervention aims to engage patients in an interactive discussion of&#xD;
      key ACP concepts and support patient-initiated ACP actions (i.e. choosing decision-maker(s),&#xD;
      deciding on preferences during serious illness, discussing preferences with decision-makers&#xD;
      and healthcare providers, and documenting advance directives). The group visits involve two&#xD;
      2-hour sessions, one month apart, facilitated by a geriatrician and a social worker. The&#xD;
      ENACT Group Visit is based on an intervention manual that guides the structure, facilitator&#xD;
      considerations, session format, and documentation and billing details. The discussions&#xD;
      include sharing experiences related to ACP, considering values related to serious illness,&#xD;
      choosing a surrogate decision-maker(s), flexibility in decision making, and having&#xD;
      conversations with decision-makers and healthcare providers. The facilitators support an&#xD;
      interactive discussion that promotes opportunities for patients to learn from others'&#xD;
      experiences.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient readiness for Advanced Care Planning (ACP) will be measured via the Advanced Care Planning (ACP) Engagement Survey. The 4-item ACP Engagement Survey assesses ACP readiness for signing papers for a decision maker; talking with a decision maker; talking with the doctor about future care; and signing papers about future care. Possible scores range from Possible scores for each item range from 1-5 and total scores range from 4-20, with higher indicating more planning readiness and a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Clinician documentation of ACP (preferences for future medical care) in electronic health record will be measured using a standardized and double-adjudicated chart review audit process. The number of participants with clinician-documented ACP present in their electronic health records will be reported. Documentation of ACP that is added to the record as part of the ENACT group visits will be excluded.</description>
