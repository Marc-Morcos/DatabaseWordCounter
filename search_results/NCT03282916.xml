      Anti-viral therapy in Alzheimer's disease will investigate the efficacy of treating patients&#xD;
      with mild Alzheimer's disease with the U.S.A marketed generic anti-viral drug Valtrex&#xD;
      (valacyclovir, 500mg oral tablet). Valacyclovir, titrated to 4 grams per day, repurposed to&#xD;
      treat Alzheimer's disease, will be compared to matching placebo in the treatment of 130 mild&#xD;
      AD patients (65 valacyclovir, 65 placebo) who test positive for herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1)&#xD;
      or herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV2). The study will be a randomized, double-blind, 18-month&#xD;
      Phase II proof of concept trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many viruses are latent for decades before being reactivated in the brain by stress, immune&#xD;
      compromise, or other factors. After the initial oral infection, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1)&#xD;
      becomes latent in the trigeminal ganglion and can later enter the brain via retrograde axonal&#xD;
      transport, often targeting the temporal lobes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSV1 can also enter the brain via olfactory neurons directly. HSV1 (oral herpes) and HSV2&#xD;
      (genital herpes) are known to trigger amyloid aggregation and their DNA is commonly found in&#xD;
      amyloid plaques. Anti-HSV drugs reduce Aβ and p-tau accumulation in brains of infected mice.&#xD;
      HSV1 reactivation is associated with tau hyperphosphorylation in mice and may play a role in&#xD;
      tau propagation across neurons. In humans, recurrent reactivation with newly produced HSV1&#xD;
      particles, 'drop by drop,' may produce neuronal damage and eventually lead to&#xD;
      neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, partly due to effects on amyloid&#xD;
      and tau. Clinical studies show cognitive impairment in HSV seropositive patients in different&#xD;
      patient groups and in healthy adults, and antiviral treatments show robust efficacy against&#xD;
      peripheral HSV infection. The study team will conduct the first-ever clinical trial to&#xD;
      directly address the long-standing viral etiology hypothesis of AD which posits that viruses,&#xD;
      particularly the very common HSV1 and HSV2, may be etiologic or contribute to the pathology&#xD;
      of AD. In patients with mild AD who test positive for serum antibodies to HSV1 or HSV2, the&#xD;
      generic antiviral drug valacyclovir, repurposed as an anti-AD drug, will be compared at oral&#xD;
      doses of 4 grams per day, to matching placebo in the treatment of 130 patients (65&#xD;
      valacyclovir, 65 placebo) in a randomized, double-blind, 78-week Phase II proof of concept&#xD;
      trial. Patients treated with valacyclovir are hypothesized to show smaller decline in&#xD;
      cognition and functioning compared to placebo, and, using 18F-Florbetapir PET imaging, to&#xD;
      show less amyloid accumulation than placebo over the 78-week trial. Through the use of tau&#xD;
      PET imaging with the tracer 18F-MK-6240 at baseline and 78 weeks, patients treated with&#xD;
      valacyclovir are hypothesized to show smaller increases in 18F-MK-6240 binding than patients&#xD;
      treated with placebo from baseline to 78 weeks. Apolipoprotein E genotype at baseline, as&#xD;
      well as changes in cortical thinning on structural MRI, olfactory identification deficits,&#xD;
      and antiviral antibody titers from baseline to 78 weeks, will be evaluated in exploratory&#xD;
      analyses. In patients who agree to lumbar puncture, plasma and CSF acyclovir will be assayed&#xD;
      to establish the degree of CNS penetration of valacyclovir in mild AD, and the investigators&#xD;
      will obtain CSF Aβ42, tau, p-tau for subset exploratory analyses with changes in outcome&#xD;
      measures. If this trial is successful, the investigators will apply for funding to conduct a&#xD;
      larger, multicenter, Phase III study using a study design that will be informed by the&#xD;
      results of this Phase II trial. This innovative Phase II proof of concept trial clearly has&#xD;
      exceptionally high reward potential for the treatment of AD.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females. Females must be postmenopausal defined as 12 consecutive months&#xD;
             without menstruation. Patient Report&#xD;

          2. Diagnosis of probable AD by NIA clinical diagnostic criteria. Physician Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Folstein Mini Mental State (MMSE) score 18 to 28 (inclusive) out of 30.&#xD;
             Neuropsychological Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 1 (mild dementia). Physician Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A family member or other individual who is in contact with the patient and consents to&#xD;
             serve as informant during the study Patient Report&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient retains capacity to consent for him/herself or retains the capacity to&#xD;
             identify a surrogate who will consent on his/her behalf. Patient Report&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. At screening, patients must test positive for serum antibodies to HSV1 or HSV2.&#xD;
             Patients that test equivocal (index between 0.90-1.09; &lt; 0.90 is negative and &gt; 1.09&#xD;
             is positive) will repeat the test within 6 weeks at a repeat visit. If the results are&#xD;
             negative at the second test, the patient will not enter the study. If the results are&#xD;
             equivocal or positive at the second test (first test was equivocal), we will enroll&#xD;
             the patient in the study because &quot;equivocal&quot; indicates the presence of antibodies that&#xD;
             do not reach the minimum threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, and concomitant psychotropic&#xD;
             medications (other than high dose benzodiazepines), will be permitted throughout the&#xD;
             trial. Doses of these medications will need to be stable for at least 1 month prior to&#xD;
             study entry. Any changes to the medication will be documented in the participant&#xD;
             research chart. Medications given for other medical reasons, e.g., anti-diabetic or&#xD;
             antihypertensive medications, will not be altered for the purposes of this trial and&#xD;
             the patient's primary physician may adjust such medications as medically indicated&#xD;
             throughout the trial. Details of concomitant medication use will be documented at all&#xD;
             visits and will be available for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For patients diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment and CDR score of 0.5 (&#xD;
             questionable dementia), if these patients have biomarkers of AD neuropathology with&#xD;
             either a positive amyloid PET scan, positive fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scan of the&#xD;
             brain, or positive findings for AD in CSF ( low ABeta42 and high tau, p-tau protein&#xD;
             levels) they will be eligible for the study. This applies to patients who already had&#xD;
             an amyloid PET scan, FDG PET scan of the brain, or lumbar puncture, prior to&#xD;
             recruitment into the protocol.&#xD;

             conducted if there is no lower spinal malformation or other contraindication to lumbar&#xD;
             puncture. Physician Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. For MRI, metal implants and pacemaker, and claustrophobia such that the patient&#xD;
             refuses MRI. In the investigators' experience, these exclusions occur in less than 5%&#xD;
             of patients with mild AD. MRI is required for VALAD. Patient Report/ Physician&#xD;
             Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Radiation exposure in the prior 12 months that, together with 18F-Florbetapir and&#xD;
             18F--MK-6240 PET, will be above the FDA annual radiation exposure threshold. This will&#xD;
             be determined through study staff ( i.e. Principal Investigator, Study Physician)&#xD;
             discussion with potential subjects at Screening, documenting inquiry about radiation&#xD;
             history. If there is any history of additional radiation exposure in the past year; it&#xD;
             will be reviewed with PET Center staff for their approval before proceeding. The&#xD;
             combined radiation exposure from the maximum doses used for 18F-Florbetapir and&#xD;
             18F-MK- 6240 is within the FDA limits for annual radiation exposure and the second&#xD;
             scan in each patient will be done 18 months after the initial PET scan (for both&#xD;
             radioligands). Patient Report/Physician Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Severe vision or hearing impairment that would prevent the participant from performing&#xD;
             the psychometric tests accurately. This will be a clinical determination by the study&#xD;
             physician without formal testing or audiometry Physician Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Olfaction component: current upper respiratory infection (patient tested as soon as&#xD;
             this improves), current smoker &gt; 1 pack daily (past smoking has been shown not to&#xD;
             affect UPSIT scores, UPSIT score &lt; 12/40 (10 out of 40 is scored by chance in this&#xD;
             multiple-choice test) indicating congenital anosmia. In the investigators' experience,&#xD;
             less than 3% of cases are excluded for having one or more of these exclusionary&#xD;
             criteria. If a patient is excluded from the olfaction component, the patient will&#xD;
             still be eligible for the main protocol and all other study procedures. Patient&#xD;
