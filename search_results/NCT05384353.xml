      This study will compare the discriminative power of [18F]-SynVesT-1 PET and the&#xD;
      standard-of-care [18F]-FDG PET in different cognitive disorders (Alzheimer's disease,&#xD;
      Frontotemporal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies and late-life psychiatric disorders).&#xD;
      Moreover, changes in [18F]-SynVesT-1 PET will be evaluated as well as their correlation with&#xD;
      specific symptomatology.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty healthy controls will be included as well as 110 patients that were referred by the UZ&#xD;
      Leuven memory clinic with uncertain diagnosis of cognitive impairment and are already sent&#xD;
      for [18F]-FDG PET imaging in their workup (estimated subgroup size: 30 patients with final&#xD;
      diagnosis AD (aMCI); 20 patients with DLB; 30 patients with FTD; 30 patients with late-life&#xD;
      psychiatric disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans will be acquired on a 3T GE Signa PET-MR scanner, for 90 minutes starting at injection&#xD;
      of 150 MBq [18F]-SynVesT-1 for healthy controls, and from 60 to 90 minutes post injection of&#xD;
      150 MBq [18F]-SynVesT-1 for patients. For healthy controls, discrete arterial blood samples&#xD;
      will be manually collected every 10s from 10 to 90s; every 15s from 90s to 3min; and then at&#xD;
      3.5, 5, 6.5, 8, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90min. Plasma samples for correction of&#xD;
      radiometabolites will be collected at 3, 8, 15, 30, 60 and 90min after injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All healthy controls will also be subjected to a neuropsychological test battery and if&#xD;
      necessary, additional limited neuropsychological testing on top of those from the memory&#xD;
      clinic will be carried out in patients.&#xD;
