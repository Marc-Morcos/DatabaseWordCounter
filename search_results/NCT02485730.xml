  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ALFA study is a long term, prospective, observational study of AD patients' adult&#xD;
      children aimed at studying and characterizing key physio-pathological features of the&#xD;
      preclinical phase of AD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The natural history of AD includes an asymptomatic or preclinical phase characterized by&#xD;
      pathological cerebral alterations without any evident symptoms of the disease. The beginning&#xD;
      of the preclinical phase can be detected using a series of biological and neuroimaging&#xD;
      markers that indicate the presence of AÎ² deposition in the brain. A variety of factors such&#xD;
      as inflammation, genetic load (e.g., APOE4), diet, cardiovascular risk, sleep disorders and&#xD;
      cognitive reserve, produced by endogenous or exogenous factors, vary among individuals and&#xD;
      may determine the beginning and evolution of the preclinical phase of the disease. It is&#xD;
      possible to identify subclinical, biological, cognitive and neuroimaging changes, in the AD&#xD;
      preclinical phase. The longitudinal study of intra-individual changes will be more sensitive&#xD;
      than cross-sectional inter-individual studies to detect the cognitive evolution during the AD&#xD;
      preclinical phase. Similarly, it would be possible to identify factors in subjects at the&#xD;
      preclinical phase that will influence their evolution to the clinical stage of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start with a screening of 3.000 recruited volunteers (NCT01835717) complying&#xD;
      as much as possible with study selection criteria and perfectly aware of the study needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected 400 participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria will undergo detailed&#xD;
      phenotyping consisting in: clinical history, AD family history, full cognitive evaluation,&#xD;
      cognitive reserve determination, CSF sample collection, blood and urine sample collection,&#xD;
      neuroimaging (MRI), quality of life and habits of life questionnaires (physical activity,&#xD;
      diet, sleeping habits, social activity, toxics habits, pollution exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longitudinal study will consist in a every 3-year follow-up visit in which the&#xD;
      participant will undergo a review of the clinical history data, a full cognitive evaluation,&#xD;
      neuroimaging (MRI), samples collection (blood, urine, CSF) and update of the life habits&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
