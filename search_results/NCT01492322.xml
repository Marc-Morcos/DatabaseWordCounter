  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A polymorphism in the dopamine transporter (DAT) may determine how much dopamine is available&#xD;
      at the synapse and this may affect the underlying reasons for relapse in smokers. This&#xD;
      research will use Single-photon emission computed tomography SPECT and the DAT-specific&#xD;
      ligand, TRODAT (Dopamine Transporter Density by [99mTc]), to examine the availability of DAT&#xD;
      in smokers grouped by genotype in the sated (just having smoked) and withdrawal (4 hours&#xD;
      without smoking) conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 2 SPECT scans for each smoker who participates in this research. One SPECT scan&#xD;
      when the smoker is sated with nicotine and one where the smoker is in withdrawal&#xD;

        Subjects will be forty physically-healthy and mentally-stable male and non-pregnant female&#xD;
        subjects between the ages of 18 and 60 who meet the DSM-IV criteria for nicotine&#xD;
        dependence. Subjects will not be excluded based on gender, religion, race, or socioeconomic&#xD;
        status. The subject population of previous smoking studies in our lab was 54% female, 62%&#xD;
        Caucasian, and averaged 15 years of education. This is representative of the urban&#xD;
        population in the northeast region of the United States who seek help for nicotine&#xD;
        dependence. We expect our current population to have similar characteristics.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Physically healthy male or female nicotine dependent patients ages 18-60 without other&#xD;
             current drug dependence (excluding marijuana) or psychiatric diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day for at least 6 months prior to study start date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Females must be non-pregnant, non-lactating and either be of non-childbearing&#xD;
             potential (i.e. sterilized via hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or at least 1&#xD;
             year post-menopausal) or of child bearing potential, but practicing a medically&#xD;
             acceptable method of birth control from at least 48 hours prior to SPECT imaging until&#xD;
             30 days following the scan. Examples of medically acceptable methods for this protocol&#xD;
             include barrier (diaphragm or condom) with spermicide, an intrauterine device (IUD),&#xD;
             oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel implant, or complete abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects provide voluntary informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must read on 8th grade (or above) level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Not using other methods for smoking cessation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participation in clinical trial and receipt of investigational drug(s) during previous&#xD;
             60 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of head trauma or injury causing loss of consciousness, lasting more than&#xD;
             three (3) minutes or associated with skull fracture or inter-cranial bleeding or&#xD;
             abnormal MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. HIV positive on medication for symptoms. This will be determined on an individual&#xD;
             basis by results from the physical examination and final approval by our study&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Symptomatic presence of other hematological disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic (liver), renal (kidney), neurological,&#xD;
             or endocrinological (including Type II diabetes) abnormalities.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. History of psychosis, seizures, or organic brain syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of medications or natural herbs that may cause sedation or may effect the brain&#xD;
             systems that are being studied (medication use will be evaluated by our study&#xD;
             physician on a case-by-case basis).&#xD;
&#xD;

         10. Individuals with an intelligence quotient of 80 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Smoke non-filtered cigarettes&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Treatment for alcohol or drug dependence within the last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. A significant alcohol or drug use history (multiple treatments, 5 years of dependence,&#xD;
             positive urines, etc.).&#xD;
