      This study intends to use Play Intervention for Dementia (PID) to promote cognitive functions&#xD;
      of people with early to moderate dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cluster randomized controlled trial aims to recruit 38 participants from two study&#xD;
      sites. Participants will be randomly allocated into intervention or wait-list controlled&#xD;
      groups. Both groups will receive the same content of PID programme at different time. The PID&#xD;
      consists of 12 weekly sessions. Each session lasts for 45-75 minutes. The PID will be&#xD;
      facilitated by a play specialist, trained elderly volunteers, and centre staffs. Cognitive&#xD;
      functions will be evaluated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Fuld Object Memory Evaluation&#xD;
      and Modified Verbal Fluency Test, conducted by a trained research assistant blinded to group&#xD;
      allocation. Centre staffs (not involved in the PID) will be interviewed. Every alternate&#xD;
      session will be video-taped for understanding the experience of the participants in the PID&#xD;
      programme.&#xD;

      Methodology To investigate the feasibility of using Play Intervention for Dementia for&#xD;
      enhancing the cognitive functions of people with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the feasibility of using Play Intervention for Dementia for enhancing&#xD;
           cognitive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the effects of Play Intervention of Dementia on cognitive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the experience of participating in the play intervention by people with&#xD;
           dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design This study is a feasibility study, designed as a cluster randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. Two study sites (day care centres) have agreed to join this project and&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to either PID group, or wait-list control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed methods design will be employed to address the three research objectives. To evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of Play Intervention, information about the ease of recruitment, attendance,&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse events during play intervention will be collected. Staff perceptions&#xD;
      upon play intervention will be explored through semi-structured interview. To explore the&#xD;
      preliminary effects of Play Intervention, participants' cognitive functions will be measured&#xD;
      at baseline (T0), after 2 months (T1), and post intervention (T2). To examine the experience&#xD;
      of Play Intervention by people with dementia, every alternate session will be videotaped for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Participating centres will recruit and screen the eligibility of participants.&#xD;
      After obtaining initial consent from the potential participants and their next of kin,&#xD;
      his/her eligibility will be verified by the research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are community dwelling, at the age of 65 or above with a medical confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of any type of dementia (such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, etc.).&#xD;
      He/she is at the stage of early to moderate dementia, at the stage of 4-6 screened by Global&#xD;
      Deterioration Scale, and able to sit independently and participate in table activities; and&#xD;
      physically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There was no empirical research conducted on play intervention for dementia. As play&#xD;
      intervention is regarded as a general cognitive stimulation activity in this study, sample&#xD;
      size will be estimated with reference to related literature. Based on the systematic review&#xD;
      of cognitive stimulation on cognitive functions, moderate effect size is found (SMD = 0.41,&#xD;
      95% CI = 0.25, 0.57), with the significance level of 0.05, power 0.8. Assuming of 20%&#xD;
      attrition rate, 188 participants / group will be needed. This study is a feasibility study,&#xD;
      and therefore only 10% of main study will be recruited, i.e. 19 participants/group, 38&#xD;
      participants in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The Play Intervention for Dementia was developed by Prof A. Ka Tat Tsang of the&#xD;
      University of Toronto and his research team in 2013. It was based on the Strategies and&#xD;
      Skills Learning and Development (SSLD) model, for promoting the quality of life of&#xD;
      individuals with dementia. According to the SSLD model, human actions are driven by unmet&#xD;
      needs. Maslow (1943) stated that people are motivated to achieve the needs, including&#xD;
      physiological needs, safety needs, belonging needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization&#xD;
      needs. People with dementia also have these needs, but they have difficulties to satisfy the&#xD;
      needs because of the diminished cognitive abilities. Despite of the neuropathological changes&#xD;
      caused by dementia, in play intervention, needs of belonging can be satisfied through social&#xD;
      interaction in the group activities; needs of esteem can be contented through playing with&#xD;
      toys independently in their own way and being respect throughout the process; and needs of&#xD;
      self-actualization are fulfilled by realizing one's ability and creativity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PID programme has been piloted in Yee Hong Geriatric Centre, Toronto, Canada and Yan Oi&#xD;
      Tong Day Care Centre of Hong Kong. Other than the intended outcomes (i.e. mood and quality of&#xD;
      life), general improvement in cognitive functions (including attention, memory, quantitative&#xD;
      ability, responsiveness, verbal expression) was noted by the family relatives and the&#xD;
      researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will replicate the intervention conducted in the previous trials. Each group will&#xD;
      consist of 12 - 20 elderly, who will be further divided into three to four subgroups. They&#xD;
      will participate in a 12 weekly session for 45 - 75 minutes. In each session, the&#xD;
      participants will have warm up activities and play with toys with the other members in the&#xD;
      subgroup. The toys have different characteristics that would stimulate gross/fine motor&#xD;
      skills, proprioception, neuro-corporeal integration, sensory-motor coordination, cognitive&#xD;
      capacity, and emotional expression. Examples of these toys are Jenga, Domino, Board Games,&#xD;
      beach ball and plush toy. The session will conclude with playing a percussive music&#xD;
      instrument. Play assistant (trained elderly volunteer) will facilitate the play intervention&#xD;
      by setting up the play area, encouraging participation, offering assistance with minimal&#xD;
      instructions, providing attention, and ensuring safety. They will transfer toys between&#xD;
      subgroups every 8 - 10 minutes. It is because Mayer and Griffin (1990) found that people with&#xD;
      dementia would show considerable interest on toys and engage in stimulus-seeking and&#xD;
      exploring behavior within 10 minutes during unstructured active play. Play assistants will be&#xD;
      trained by a Play Specialist. Participants will remain seated at the same table. The&#xD;
      intervention fidelity will be monitored through the programme by a Play Specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Play Specialist possesses a professional qualification in one of the human service&#xD;
      professions by licensing or regulatory authorities (e.g. registered nurse, registered social&#xD;
      workers), and has successfully completed at least 30 hours of SSLD and Play Intervention&#xD;
      training in a recognized or accredited programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wait-list control condition The control group will receive standard care only until the last&#xD;
      data collection was conducted in the experimental group. Standard care consists of medical&#xD;
      and personal care, provision of basic needs, and activities carried out as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Demographic data including age and gender, socioeconomic and educational&#xD;
      background, medical history, living arrangement and marital status will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global cognitive functions of the participants will be assessed with the Hong Kong&#xD;
      version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment which has excellent inter-rater reliability and good&#xD;
      discriminatory ability. It consists of 11 questions and takes around 15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fuld Object Memory Evaluation (FOME) will be used for evaluating memory functions of&#xD;
      encoding, storage, and recall across five recall trials and a delayed recall trial. This&#xD;
      instrument has been validated in the Hong Kong Chinese population with good test-retest&#xD;
      reliability, convergent validity, and discriminative power, and independent to educational&#xD;
      background. Verbal fluency will be assessed by the Modified Fuld Verbal Fluency (MVFT). This&#xD;
      instrument is modified from the original Fuld Verbal Fluency Test with cultural adaptation,&#xD;
      which is a part of the FOME. The FOME and MVFT will take only 15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interview&#xD;
&#xD;
      At post-intervention, semi-structured interviews with staff will be conducted to explore&#xD;
      their perception of play intervention and its effects on participants with the intervention&#xD;
      group. Responsible programme workers or social workers from two study sites will be invited.&#xD;
      The questions will be but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do you think play intervention can have a positive or negative effect on the&#xD;
           participants?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Have you seen a change in participants' symptoms or well-being since they start&#xD;
           receiving play intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video-taped The engagement of participants in the play intervention will be analyzed by&#xD;
      watching the videotapes and filling in a log-sheet by the play assistants. In the log sheet,&#xD;
      (a) total time spent, (b) names of all the activities participants engaged in and time spent&#xD;
      on each toy, (c) level of engagement, (d) assistance participants needed, (e) participants'&#xD;
      verbal and nonverbal reactions, and (f) barriers to engagement in activities will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedure A trained research assistant will be responsible for data&#xD;
      collection and the semi-structured interview. He/she will be blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Ethical approval will be sought from the University and participating&#xD;
      organization. The participation will be entirely voluntary. Verbal explanation and&#xD;
      information sheet will be given to the participants and their next of kin. Written consent&#xD;
      will be sought from next of kin. Staff to be interviewed will also be explained about the&#xD;
      study, and their informed consent will be sought too. Participants and their next-of-kin, and&#xD;
      staff are free to withdraw anytime of the study without any penalty. Before each session,&#xD;
      participates will be invited to join the play intervention. If he/she declined twice, his/her&#xD;
      decision will be respected, but the play assistant and centre staff will invite again in the&#xD;
      later session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The play intervention is regarded safe and no side effect has been reported. However, if&#xD;
      there is emotional upset or any other adverse reaction, the participant will be brought away&#xD;
      from the venue and referred to the centre social worker for follow-up. The participant may&#xD;
      choose to continue or withdraw from the next intervention session. The questions being asked&#xD;
      by the research assistant during data collection are neutral and should not arouse any&#xD;
      negative feeling. However, if emotional upset is observed, the research assistant will try to&#xD;
      comfort the participant and refer to the social worker immediately. All the data collected&#xD;
      will be kept confidential, while only the research team can retrieve. Individual identity&#xD;
      would not be revealed in any published materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical software SPSS 23.0 will be used for data entry and analysis. As this study&#xD;
      will adopt cluster randomization, characteristics of participants from the same centre may be&#xD;
      correlated. The Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model will be used to conduct the&#xD;
      repeated measurement analysis and correct the within cluster correlation. In all analysis, 5%&#xD;
      significance level will be used. 95% Confident interval will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will be audio-taped, transcribed and then subjected to thematic analysis by&#xD;
      two researchers to elicit concisely described patterns and themes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At Baseline, after 2 months (T1)</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item Fuld Object Memory Evaluation was used to measure memory of participants. Three scores were derived from the scale, namely total storage (score range: 0 to 50), total retrieval (score range: 0 to 50) and delayed recall (score range: 0 to 10). Higher scores refer to better memory. The scores reported are the adjusted post-test mean scores using its baseline measures as a covariate in ANCOVA.</description>

        <description>The 10-item Fuld Object Memory Evaluation was used to measure memory of participants. Three scores were derived from the scale, namely total storage (score range: 0 to 50), total retrieval (score range: 0 to 50) and delayed recall (score range: 0 to 10). Higher scores refer to better memory. The scores reported are the adjusted post-test mean scores using its baseline measures as a covariate in ANCOVA.</description>
