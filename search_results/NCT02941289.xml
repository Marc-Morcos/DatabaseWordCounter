      The aim is to understand which components of attentional deployment and selection are&#xD;
      impaired in AD during searching in realistic scenes on a computer screen (Experiment 1) and&#xD;
      in a natural setting (Experiment 2).The investigators will also examine how deficits in&#xD;
      visual exploration may be related to impairments in semantic, long-term memory (LTM) and&#xD;
      working memory (WM) representations by manipulating the semantic consistency between the&#xD;
      target and its visual surroundings, and the type of target cue (abstract vs. precise),&#xD;
      respectively. Perceptual saliency of target and distractor objects will be also manipulated&#xD;
      in Expt.1, In Expt.2, in order to determine how deficits in visual exploration may be&#xD;
      involved in the IADL deficits shown by AD patients, participants at each trial will be&#xD;
      required to search in a natural settings different types of targets and then to perform an&#xD;
      IADL using five objects, among which one of the searched targets. Measures analysed: for the&#xD;
      search tasks (Expt. 1 and 2): eye movements in different search phases, accuracy and response&#xD;
      times; for IADLs tasks (Expt. 2): eye movements during action planning and execution, motor&#xD;
      efficiency (number and types of action performed), time to terminate the activity. Compared&#xD;
      to controls, the investigators expect that AD patients will have reduced ability using scene&#xD;
      semantic LTM in order to locate the objects, greater attentional capture from highly salient&#xD;
      features and greater search performance impairment when higher WM resources are required&#xD;
      (abstract target cues). The investigators also expect that their performance at IADLs will be&#xD;
      less efficient and, in particular, less organized than control, with reduced advantage of eye&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been well established that visual attention declines early in Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      (AD). Little is known about visual search in AD, in particular in relation with functional&#xD;
      autonomy. The crucial role of the parietal cortex in visuospatial attention and instrumental&#xD;
      activities of daily living (IADLs), and the presence of early parietal damage in AD suggest&#xD;
      that IADLs may also be impaired early. The aim is to understand which components of&#xD;
      attentional deployment and selection are specifically impaired in AD during searching in&#xD;
      static realistic scenes presented on a computer screen (Experiment 1) and in a natural&#xD;
      setting (Experiment 2: different regions of a room, furnished with different types of objects&#xD;
      indicating different possible daily-living environments, like a kitchen or an office). More&#xD;
      precisely, the investigators will examine how deficits in visual exploration during search&#xD;
      for a target objects may be related to impairments in semantic, long-term memory (LTM) and in&#xD;
      working memory (WM) representations by manipulating, respectively, semantic consistency&#xD;
      between the target and type of its visual surrounding (scene context, in Expt. 1, or type of&#xD;
      co-occurring objects, in Expt 2).and the type of prior information supplied about the target&#xD;
      object (abstract - i.e., verbal - or precise, - i.e., pictorial), In Expt. 1 the&#xD;
      investigators will also manipulate the perceptual salience (low-level feature: luminance,&#xD;
      colour, orientation, etc.) of the target and the distractor objects within the scene. Second,&#xD;
      to determine how deficits in visual exploration during search for specific objects may be&#xD;
      involved in the deficits of IADL in AD, the investigators will analyse search behaviour in&#xD;
      the natural setting, requiring location of three different targets (semantically&#xD;
      consistent/related to an IADL, semantically consistent/ non-related to an IADL, semantically&#xD;
      inconsistent/non-related). The investigators will required participants to perform an IADL&#xD;
      after each search (four trial in total) using, among other four objects, the IADL-related&#xD;
      searched target). In Expt. 1 the investigators will test three groups of participants: the AD&#xD;
      group (at early stage of the disease), a matched control group of healthy elderly people and&#xD;
      a control group of young, healthy individuals. The investigators will examine search&#xD;
      performance (accuracy and response time) and oculomotor behaviour during the different search&#xD;
      phases (initiation, scene scanning, target verification). They expect that AD patients will&#xD;
      have reduced search performance compared to both control groups, which will be also reflected&#xD;
      by reduced oculomotor efficiency during the overall search process. Moreover, they&#xD;
      hypothesize that patients will be less able to use semantic memory of the type of scene in&#xD;
      order to locate the target (reduced benefit of scene consistency), will be strongly&#xD;
      disadvantaged in case of higher WM load (abstract target cue) and, finally, will be more&#xD;
      influence by perceptual, low-level factors (stronger effect of salience). In Exp. 2, they&#xD;
      will test an AD group and a control group of healthy, matched, old controls. With respect to&#xD;
      the search tasks, they will analyse the effect of target semantic consistency, target&#xD;
      relatedness to IADL and type of target cue (abstract vs. precise). In doing so, they will&#xD;
      consider search performance (accuracy and response times) and oculomotor behaviour during&#xD;
      search in terms of order and number of object fixated, and duration of their fixation. With&#xD;
      respect to the IADLs, they will analyse eye guidance on current action and efficiency of the&#xD;
      whole IADL in terms of type and number of actions performed and time to perform the overall&#xD;
      activity. They expect that the patterns of eye movements in AD patients will be similar&#xD;
      during search and IADLs, with numerous intrusions of distractors and frequent reselections of&#xD;
      the same objects. Moreover, they expect that their performance at IADLs will be less&#xD;
      efficient than controls, in terms of both action speed and organisation. The use of a natural&#xD;
      setting and the analysis of spontaneous oculomotor behavior of patients will improve the&#xD;
      ecological validity of research on attentional deficits in AD. This study can also contribute&#xD;
      to innovative solutions for diagnosis and treatment, and help research on subjective change&#xD;
      in attention and visuospatial function in AD&#xD;
