  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is commonly associated with behavioural changes such as agitation.&#xD;
      Severe agitation is important to treat because it not only increases progression of AD and&#xD;
      physical health problems (increased falls and weight loss), but it also decreases quality of&#xD;
      life and increases caregiver stress. Currently prescribed treatments (i.e., antipsychotics)&#xD;
      for agitation in AD do not work in everybody and when they do work the effect is small and&#xD;
      they increase the risk of harmful side effects, including death. As a result, there is an&#xD;
      urgent need for safer medication options. The cannabinoid nabilone can now be prescribed in&#xD;
      capsule form for appetite and pain killing effects. Nabilone's calming effects may benefit&#xD;
      those with agitation, and help the weight loss and untreated pain frequently associated with&#xD;
      agitation. Through a clinical trial, the investigators hope identify the benefits of nabilone&#xD;
      in the treatment of agitation in AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators objective is to determine whether nabilone is an efficacious and safe&#xD;
      treatment for agitation, as well as having benefits for pain, weight and behavioural&#xD;
      symptoms. This will be a 14 week clinical trial (participants take nabilone for 6 weeks,&#xD;
      placebo for 6 weeks (order randomized) with 1 week between treatments). The investigators&#xD;
      will assess and compare agitation, weight, pain, memory, behaviour and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nabilone is a new class of medication that may be a safe and effective treatment for&#xD;
      agitation in AD, with added benefits on appetite and pain. Reducing these symptoms would&#xD;
      increase quality-of-life and reduce caregiver stress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: The investigators objective is to provide pilot data addressing whether the&#xD;
      ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) analogue nabilone is a pharmacological option for managing&#xD;
      agitation, a particularly difficult to treat neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS), as well as&#xD;
      having benefits for pain, weight and overall NPS, and gather double-blind information on&#xD;
      tolerability and safety. This group of symptoms is particularly prevalent in patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: The high prevalence and impact of agitation in patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) makes this neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) a key determinant of&#xD;
      decreased quality of life. Associated with agitation are weight loss, and pain, both of which&#xD;
      lead to additional loss of quality of life. Agitation frequently necessitates use of&#xD;
      antipsychotics, which, while well-studied, have modest efficacy and severe side effects&#xD;
      including increased mortality. With the development of synthetic THC analogues, the&#xD;
      therapeutic potential of cannabinoids can now be evaluated. Cannabinoids can be prescribed as&#xD;
      capsules to treat anorexia and pain in certain patient groups. In addition to these&#xD;
      potentially beneficial effects on appetite and pain, a recent study suggested positive&#xD;
      effects of nabilone on agitation in dementia. Importantly, in addition to psychotropic&#xD;
      effects, emerging evidence suggests neuroprotective (inhibit Aβ-induced microglial activation&#xD;
      and excitotoxicity) and anti-inflammatory abilities, which can decrease oxidative stress, in&#xD;
      stark contrast to the negative effects of antipsychotics. As such, this system is of high&#xD;
      potential relevance in agitated patients with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: This will be a randomized cross-over study comparing 6 weeks of nabilone and&#xD;
      placebo, with a 1 week placebo washout preceding each treatment phase in Long-term care (LTC)&#xD;
      patients, and outpatients with moderate to severe AD and agitation. Study outcomes will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline and end of treatment for each treatment phase. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure will be the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). The secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      be the weight (kg), overall NPS (Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)), NPI agitation/aggression&#xD;
      subscale, nutrition (Mini Nutritional Assessment - Short Form (MNA-SF), body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), skin fold thickness), pain (The Pain Assessment In Advanced Dementia (PAINAD)),&#xD;
      cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); Severe Impairment Battery (SIB)) and&#xD;
      clinical significance (Alzheimer's Cooperative Study-Clinician Global Impression of change&#xD;
      (ADCS-CGIC). Safety (heart rate, blood pressure, and adverse events) will also be assessed at&#xD;
      every visit.&#xD;
