  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This longitudinal cohort study investigates cognitively normal participants with and without&#xD;
      preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) in order to examine: (1) the relationship between falls&#xD;
      and functional mobility in preclinical stages of AD; and (2) a hypothesized model of central&#xD;
      and peripheral mechanism(s) underlying falls and functional mobility in preclinical stages of&#xD;
      AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer disease (AD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease. Conversion to&#xD;
      symptomatic AD occurs slowly over years through a series of preclinical stages marked by&#xD;
      changes in molecular biomarkers. It is unknown whether functional mobility and falls are&#xD;
      preclinical markers of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This longitudinal clinical study evaluates a cohort of cognitively normal individuals who are&#xD;
      currently undergoing comprehensive clinical, neuropsychological, and biomarker evaluations at&#xD;
      the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC). They receive an annual in-home&#xD;
      evaluation of fall risks and functional mobility and prospective ascertainment of falls.&#xD;
      Comparisons of assessments of functional mobility will be performed with regard to measures&#xD;
      of brain pathology (i.e., amyloidosis, tau, and neurodegeneration) to allow researchers to&#xD;
      characterize when changes in falls and functional mobility occur during preclinical stages of&#xD;
      AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also examines the central and peripheral system mechanism(s) underlying falls and&#xD;
      functional mobility in preclinical AD using structural equation modeling.&#xD;

Constructs that will be included are: vision, alcohol abuse, urinary incontinence, depression, pain, medication, functional capacity with activities of daily living, previous falls, home hazards, and self-efficacy.</description>
