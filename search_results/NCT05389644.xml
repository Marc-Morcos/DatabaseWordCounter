      This proposal will demonstrate that non-invasive brain stimulation is able to modulate&#xD;
      cortico-striatal circuits in neurodegenerative patients with apathy, and that doing so&#xD;
      results in circuit-specific increases in FC and DA availability. These circuit changes will&#xD;
      be accompanied by changes in specific behavioral dimensions of apathy. This work will lead to&#xD;
      larger studies which develop personalized, circuit-specific neuromodulation strategies for AD&#xD;
      patients suffering from this intractable neuropsychiatric symptom.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apathy is among the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), with&#xD;
      prevalence estimates up to 72%. Apathy in AD is associated with significant morbidity, high&#xD;
      caregiver burden, and is correlated with disease severity. While other behavioral symptoms&#xD;
      are clinically addressable in AD, there are currently no effective treatments for apathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Executive aspects of apathy involve deficits in goal-directed planning, rule maintenance,&#xD;
      cognitive flexibility, and set-shifting. Motivational aspects of apathy involve reward&#xD;
      anticipation, valuation of the effort needed to achieve a goal, and the consummatory&#xD;
      experience once a goal is achieved. Importantly, these discrete cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      dimensions can be mapped onto discrete fronto-striatal circuits. For example, executive&#xD;
      deficits are likely to map onto dorsolateral prefrontal-striatal loops (a dorsal&#xD;
      apathy-related circuit). In contrast, motivational processing is localizable to projections&#xD;
      between the ventral striatum (VS) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventromedial&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (a ventral apathy-related circuit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dopamine (DA) supports processing in both the dorsal and ventral circuits, and there is&#xD;
      voluminous evidence that DA plays roles in encoding reward prediction/valuation and&#xD;
      motivation. For example, the ventral circuit receives dense monosynaptic dopaminergic&#xD;
      projections from the ventral tegmental area, and several studies have invoked this pathway in&#xD;
      reward processing. DA also plays a role in executive function. Moreover, apathy is observed&#xD;
      in patients with disorders of DA availability, in patients taking DA antagonists and with&#xD;
      lesions in the meso-cortico-limbic pathway. More specifically, AD patients exhibit decreased&#xD;
      striatal DA availability. Taken together, decreased DA transmission in the dorsal and ventral&#xD;
      circuits represent putative neurochemical mechanisms for apathy in AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is capable of modulating fMRI&#xD;
      resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in a circuit-specific manner. For example, our&#xD;
      group, as well as others, have demonstrated the feasibility of modulating network FC through&#xD;
      stimulation of a cortically accessible network node. Other studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      behavioral changes with circuit-specific neuromodulation. Prefrontal rTMS can also modulate&#xD;
      monoaminergic neurotransmitter release in a regionally specific way. For example,&#xD;
      intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS, a form of rTMS) increases tonic endogenous DA&#xD;
      release in animal models, and this effect can be blocked by DA receptor antagonists. There is&#xD;
      also evidence in humans that topographically specific changes in DA release can be elicited&#xD;
      based on the circuit stimulated. For instance, Strafella and colleagues used an rTMS-11C-&#xD;
      raclopride paradigm to show regionally specific changes in DA availability following&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) stimulation and primary motor cortex stimulation,&#xD;
      respectively. We recently extended this work by employing a combined MRI-PET paradigm with&#xD;
      11C-raclopride. In that protocol, three subjects underwent iTBS to two adjacent dlPFC&#xD;
      targets. These targets were functionally identified by the maximal FC with two dorsal&#xD;
      striatal regions: the left caudate and left putamen, and these were seeded based on&#xD;
      coordinates derived from large datasets. Targets were stimulated based on modeled E- field&#xD;
      distributions. As predicted, iTBS induced regionally specific changes in striatal DA&#xD;
      availability, with changes in 11C- raclopride binding potentials (BPND) occurring at the&#xD;
      sites of maximal FC with the respective iTBS targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To optimize rTMS targeting of apathy-relevant circuits in AD patients with apathy:&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: FC estimates, acquired with accelerated multi-band imaging, will identify, on&#xD;
      an individualized basis, rTMS accessible cortical targets (e.g., in vmPFC/mOFC and in dlPFC)&#xD;
      which are most functionally coupled to relevant striatal regions (e.g., the VS and dorsal&#xD;
      caudate) in a group of AD patients with apathy. Hypothesis 1.2: State-of-the-art E-field&#xD;
      modeling will optimize coil position and orientation needed to best stimulate the&#xD;
      apathy-relevant circuits. Modeling will be informed by (a) structural estimates of cortical&#xD;
      atrophy, (b) diffusion MRI tractography estimates of white matter fiber bundles from cortical&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To use rTMS to differentially modulate FC in apathy-relevant circuits in AD patients&#xD;
      with apathy: Hypothesis 2.1: rTMS to the dorsal circuit will increase FC specifically in the&#xD;
      dorsal circuit. Hypothesis 2.2: rTMS to the ventral circuit will increase FC specifically in&#xD;
      the ventral circuit. Hypothesis 2.3: Sham rTMS will not affect FC in either circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To use rTMS to differentially modulate DA in apathy-relevant circuits in AD patients&#xD;
      with apathy: Hypothesis 3.1: rTMS to the dorsal circuit will increase DA availability, (as&#xD;
      measured by changes in 11C- raclopride binding potential (BPND)), specifically in the dorsal&#xD;
      circuit. Hypothesis 3.2: rTMS to the ventral circuit will increase DA availability&#xD;
      specifically in the ventral circuit. Hypothesis 3.3: Sham rTMS will not affect DA&#xD;
      availability in either circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To assess behavioral changes induced by modulation of apathy-relevant circuits in AD&#xD;
      patients: Hypothesis 4.1: rTMS to the dorsal circuit will selectively improve executive&#xD;
      measures of goal-directed behavior, as assessed by fMRI task performance on planning portions&#xD;
      of the PACT. Hypothesis 4.2: rTMS to the vental circuit will selectively improve motivation&#xD;
      and reward anticipation, as assessed by fMRI task performance and activation on motivational&#xD;
      parts of the PACT, and on mood scales. Hypothesis 4.3: Sham rTMS will have no impact on fMRI&#xD;
      task performance or activation, nor on mood scales.&#xD;

    <description>iTBS is a form of repetitive TMS. TMS is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation. In this modality, a current is rapidly passed through a TMS coil. This coil is placed on a subject's scalp. The rapidly discharging current creates a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the coil. This magnetic field diffuses through the subject's scalp and skull until it reaches the brain parenchyma. There, it causes focal neuronal depolarization.</description>
