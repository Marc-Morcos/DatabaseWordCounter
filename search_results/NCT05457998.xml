  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study aims to examine biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease as early as possible&#xD;
      which could potentially be a screening tool for the general population. This observational&#xD;
      study will take place at the Memory and Aging Program at Butler Hospital. The study will&#xD;
      enroll up to 200 cognitively healthy subjects aged 50 to 80 years with ongoing recruitment&#xD;
      and enrollment for 2 years and participant participation lasting approximately 5 years.&#xD;
      Disclosure of AD risk assessments will be an optional procedure. Two PET imaging sub-studies&#xD;
      will also be optional.&#xD;

    <description>This study will be conducted in up to 200 subjects between the ages of 50-80 who are cognitively unimpaired with ongoing recruitment and enrollment for 2 years and participant follow-up for 5 years.&#xD;
Following analysis of blood plasma at screening, all p-tau 217 plasma positive participants will be enrolled and scheduled for the baseline visit. A randomly selected 1/10 of all p-tau 217 plasma negative participants will also be enrolled. We will enroll participants until we have reached a sample size where 3/4 of participants are amyloid positive.&#xD;
FOLLOW-UP FOR 5 YEARS: Cognitive testing, blood draws and retinal imaging will be conducted at baseline and 12 months. Cognitive testing and blood draws will be conducted at 24 months and 36 months.&#xD;
MRI and Amyloid PET scans will be performed at baseline and 24 months. An additional amyloid PET scan will be performed at 48 months.</description>

    <description>An optional tau PET imaging sub-study will be conducted in 70 subjects from the main study population who elect to participate.&#xD;
If enrolled in the optional tau PET imaging sub-study, participants will have three tau PET scans with [18F]RO-948: at baseline, 24 months, and 48 months.</description>

    <description>An optional tau PET tracer comparison sub-study will be conducted in 30 subjects from the main study population who elect to participate. These individuals will be amyloid positive as determined by Flutemetamol amyloid PET scan.&#xD;
Tau PET scans with 3 tracers ([18F]RO-948, [18F]MK-6240, and [18F]GTP-1) will be performed at baseline and 24 months. An additional Tau PET scan with [18F]RO-948 will be performed at 48 months.</description>
