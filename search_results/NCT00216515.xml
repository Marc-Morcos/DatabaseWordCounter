      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of galantamine on the attention of&#xD;
      patients with Alzheimer's Disease, how an improvement of attention of Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      patients affects their activities of daily living, and the global benefit of galantamine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest that an attention deficit occurs at early stage of Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      and affects patients' activities of daily living. In other words, some patients without&#xD;
      language or visuospatial dysfunction have severe impairment of activities of daily living,&#xD;
      which might result from attention deficit. Another recent clinical study showed that&#xD;
      galantamine is more effective in attention and vigilance of Alzheimer's disease patients than&#xD;
      donepezil. The study hypothesis is that galantamine will improve attention and frontal&#xD;
      executive function in Alzheimer's disease patients and is well-tolerated. 8 mg/day for the&#xD;
      first 4 weeks, 16 mg for the next 8 weeks&#xD;
