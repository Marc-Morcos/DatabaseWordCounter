  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is to evaluate initial efficacy and safety of the BBB disruption with&#xD;
      transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound (ExAblate 4000 type 2.0) in patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study iw designed as a prospective, single-site, single-aarm, nonrandomized study.&#xD;
      Assessments will be made before and three months after 2 sessions of BBB disruption with&#xD;
      radiologic, nuclear medicine imaging and neurophysiological examinations. Relative safety&#xD;
      will be evaluated using a common description of Significant Clinical Complications for&#xD;
      patients treated in this study.&#xD;
