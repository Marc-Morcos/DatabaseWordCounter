    <textblock>
      This study is being done to research the usefulness of PET/CT imaging for measuring brain&#xD;
      inflammation and its relation to Alzheimer's Disease. Additionally, researchers as looking to&#xD;
      learn more about the side effects of a new radioactive tracer (radiotracer) C-11 ER176.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is a devastating illness with no cure. Treatments targeting&#xD;
      known pathologic hallmarks of AD, such as amyloid-beta (AB), in symptomatic individuals have&#xD;
      proved largely fruitless so other potential disease targets warrant exploration.&#xD;
      Neuroinflammation has interesting possible associations with AD dementia and may contribute&#xD;
      to AD dementia in different ways among different individuals. Previous PET neuroinflammation&#xD;
      data are not entirely consistent and new methods of PET imaging and studies with larger&#xD;
      cohorts are needed to further investigate the role of neuroinflammation in AD dementia and&#xD;
      the utility of PET as a biomarker. This project seeks to test new PET neuroinflammation&#xD;
      imaging methods in unimpaired and AD dementia individuals with biomarker-identified brain&#xD;
      pathology to help address these gaps in knowledge in the field.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine if neuroinflammation, as measured by C-11 ER176 SUVr and inflammatory blood test measurements, is correlated with an increase in AB plaque, as measured by C-11 PiB SUVr.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 year</time_frame>
    <description>Rationale: Biomarkers that are surrogates of AD pathology are needed to provide methods to select appropriate treatment strategies. We hypothesize that increased neuroinflammation PET signal is seen in AD A+ and MCI A+ as compared to CU A+ participants and is also increased in CU A+ vs. CU A- participants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine if neuroinflammation, as measured by C-11 ER176 SUVr, is correlated with a history of increased cognitive decline in the 5 years preceding PET imaging, as measured by z scores from neuropsychiatric test results (memory, etc.).</measure>
    <time_frame>4 year</time_frame>
    <description>Rationale: Surrogate biomarkers of AD pathology, beyond amyloid and tau, are needed to better assess disease progression and prognosis in AD dementia patients. We hypothesize that increased ER176 PET signal in amyloid positive participants is associated with the rate of cognitive decline preceding the neuroinflammation PET scan.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine if neuroinflammation, as measured by PET imaging, is associated with plasma biomarkers of inflammation.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 year</time_frame>
    <description>Rationale: Plasma biomarkers are advantageous over imaging and CSF biomarkers with regards to cost, invasiveness, and feasibility in community settings. However, they may be less specific. We need to determine how plasma biomarkers correlate with PET neuroinflammation imaging as markers of disease progression, which markers are most highly correlated, and which may be specific to AD pathology. We hypothesize that hsCRP, IL-1B, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, G-CSF, IFN-g, and TNF-a will correlate with increased PET neuroinflammation imaging signal.</description>

    <description>C-11 ER176 is an investigational radiopharmaceutical that will be produced under cGMP in the Mayo Clinic Cyclotron Facility. The imaging agent (C-11 ER176) will be administered on an outpatient basis. It will be administered at a single time IV prior to the PET imaging.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males or females 60 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet the requirements for one of the four groups (CU A-, CU A+, MCI A+, AD A+).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergoing neurologic evaluation procedures with cognitive testing in the MCSA or -&#xD;
             ADRC for a minimum of about 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must have had an amyloid PiB PET scan and MRI brain scan within the&#xD;
             previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capacity to sign consent or have a legally authorized representative to sign the&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants unable to lie down without moving for 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or cannot stop breast feeding for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Actively taking daily anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs, corticosteroids, etc.)&#xD;
             except for a small control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Generalized inflammatory condition and treatment with immunosuppressive,&#xD;
             corticoid/glucocorticoid, steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication&#xD;
             within 2 weeks of scanning (only acute medication use as an exclusion so as to limit&#xD;
             medication interaction but preserve possible chronic systemic inflammation&#xD;
             interaction).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Standard safety exclusionary criteria for MRI such as metallic foreign bodies,&#xD;
             pacemaker, etc., since the quantitative PET data analysis is based on anatomic&#xD;
             criteria that are established uniquely for each subject by registration to his/her&#xD;
             MRI.&#xD;
