  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall study methods are as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Clinical Trials Schedules] The study consists of a screening period(Visit 1) of up to 30 to&#xD;
      50 days, blood collection visits(Visit 2) for IP generation and administration visits for IP&#xD;
      administration(Visit 3), with a follow-up(FU) period of 90 days(Visit 4~7). During the&#xD;
      Follow-up(FU) Period, subjects will visit 4 times for safety, tolerability and efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation, with 90 Day being the End of Study(EOS) Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Subject screening and blood collection for IP generation] During Screening Period, subjects&#xD;
      will be informed about the study and asked if they want to participate. The subjects and&#xD;
      representatives and the caregiver/study partner will be asked to sign consent forms before&#xD;
      any study-specific procedures are performed. Screening procedures will be performed to assess&#xD;
      whether the subject is eligible to participate in the study. A minimum of approximately 200&#xD;
      mL of the subject's blood will be collected ≥30 days before Baseline and shipped to the IP&#xD;
      Manufacturing Agency for generation of the IP. Subjects are required to refrain from&#xD;
      consuming alcohol ≥3 days before any blood samples for IP generation are collected. If&#xD;
      required (e.g. due to contamination), additional blood samples for IP generation may be&#xD;
      collected during an unscheduled visit.&#xD;
