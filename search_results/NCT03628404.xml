  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators established the Faroese Alzheimer's Cohort with the aim to unravel genetic&#xD;
      and environmental factors that influence the risk and/or susceptibility of Alzheimers disease&#xD;
      (AD). It is believed the Faroese population represents a unique opportunity due to its&#xD;
      characteristics as a geographic, environmental and genetic isolate with a homogeneous genetic&#xD;
      background and founder effects. It has an 'engaged' population with superbly detailed&#xD;
      genealogy going 400 years back, unfettered patient access to health care, traditionally high&#xD;
      participation rates in research and low probability of losing subjects to follow-up, and&#xD;
      presents a unique opportunity to more readily identify genetic and environmental factors&#xD;
      involved in AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enrolment of patients with AD, incl.1st degree family members of selected familial&#xD;
           patients and age and gender matched control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Detailed genealogical investigation of patients with Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify genes influencing risk and/or susceptibility of AD in the Faroese population&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to unravel genetic and environmental factors that influence the risk&#xD;
      and/or susceptibility of AD. Thus, subjects with AD and family members when there is a strong&#xD;
      history of AD are being recruited. Data collection includes a blood sample, clinical&#xD;
      phenotype data from hospital records, standardized assessment scales (e.g. Geriatric&#xD;
      Depression Scale (GDS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Functional&#xD;
      Activities Questionnaire (FAQ-IADL), tests of mental function (Mini Mental State Examination&#xD;
      (MMSE) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE)) and family and lifestyle/environmental&#xD;
      questionnaire. Furthermore are control subjects being recruited where data includes a blood&#xD;
      sample, MMSE and a lifestyle/environmental questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial genetic analyses will focus on known genetic risk factors for AD by looking at the&#xD;
      most highly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in loci harboring e.g. apolipoprotein&#xD;
      E (APOE)/Translocase Of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 40 (TOMM40), MAPT, Phosphatidylinositol&#xD;
      Binding Clathrin Assembly Protein (PICALM). Subsequent analyses will focus on genome-wide&#xD;
      array genotyping of ~ 1.8 million markers, e.g. to accommodate the population structure.&#xD;
      Finally, patients with a family history of AD who cannot be explained by the before mentioned&#xD;
      analysis will be subject to exome sequencing. Exposure analyses will focus on persistant&#xD;
      organic pollutants, e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), perfluorinated alkylated&#xD;
      substances (PFAS) and also mercury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe the Faroese population presents a unique opportunity to more&#xD;
      readily identify genetic and environmental factors involved in AD due to its characteristics&#xD;
      as a geographic, environmental and genetic isolate with a homogeneous genetic background.&#xD;

        This is a population based study conducted in the Faroe Islands, a small island population&#xD;
        with approximately 50.000 inhabitants. Individuals diagnosed with dementia are being&#xD;
        recruited from the only Dementia Clinic on the islands. Family members are also recruited.&#xD;
        Control subjects are randomly selected from the Faroese Population Registry, matched by sex&#xD;
        and age to the cases. Te&#xD;
