  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this project is to investigate the safety and efficacy of repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on cognition in patients with mild to moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. rTMS is considered a safe, well tolerated and relatively cheap&#xD;
      treatment. The appealing idea of the intervention is to improve memory by directly modulating&#xD;
      the activity of precuneus, key area linked to memory impairment. Patients will be treated&#xD;
      with rTMS in two phases: a 2-week intensive phase followed by a maintenance phase for a total&#xD;
      of 52 weeks. This project aims to provide a valid treatment to slow the worsening of symptoms&#xD;
      and improve quality of life for those with Alzheimer's and their caregivers.&#xD;

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe&#xD;
      disruption of large-scale brain networks connectivity. AD pathophysiology has been mainly&#xD;
      associated with a breakdown of the Default Mode Network (DMN) and with a structural&#xD;
      disconnection of parietal nodes. It has been shown that the precuneus (PC), a central hub of&#xD;
      the DMN, is involved in successful episodic memory retrieval, working as a key area of the&#xD;
      network activated by recognition memory. Recent anatomical works have shown that medial&#xD;
      parietal regions are interconnected with the medial temporal region, which is implicated in&#xD;
      memory retrieval. In particular, the PC was identified as a region demonstrating strong&#xD;
      functional interconnectivity with the hippocampal formation. This is of particular relevance&#xD;
      because PC is altered in AD. At early clinical stages of AD, PC is selectively vulnerable to&#xD;
      early amyloid deposition, and plays a critical role in the conversion towards dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: a novel therapeutic intervention for AD is repetitive Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (rTMS). rTMS is a non- invasive approach that can be used to induce long lasting&#xD;
      modulation of specific brain functions, inducing neuroplastic changes not only in the&#xD;
      cortical site of stimulation, but also in remote interconnected areas. In a recent double&#xD;
      blind randomized cross-over clinical pilot study, the investigators found that a two-week&#xD;
      course of daily high-frequency rTMS (20 Hz) treatment targeting the DMN (Stimulation site:&#xD;
      PC) was able to induce an improvement in episodic memory compared to placebo. Indeed, TMS-EEG&#xD;
      measurements showed that rTMS treatment, applied over the DMN, was capable to modulate the&#xD;
      cortical activity in both the targeted areas (PC) as well as in functional connected regions&#xD;
      of the DMN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims: to investigate clinical efficacy and safety of DMN rTMS applied during 12&#xD;
      months in mild to moderate AD patients. To provide novel evidence that non-invasive treatment&#xD;
      of network dysfunction, through stimulation of the PC, will represent an effective strategy&#xD;
      to enhance cognitive functions and lead to substantial slowing of cognitive and functional&#xD;
      decline in patients with mild AD. The findings yielded by the present project will have a&#xD;
      potential strong impact on clinical practice of AD patients. Since rTMS is well tolerated and&#xD;
      relatively low-priced, a positive result could lead to a fast application of the present&#xD;
      proposal to the clinical experience. If successful, the proposed project will provide support&#xD;
      for a novel treatment for cognitive dysfunction in AD patients.&#xD;
