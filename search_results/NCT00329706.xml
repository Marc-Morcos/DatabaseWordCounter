  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A brain PET scan is recognized as &quot;reasonable and necessary&quot; for some patients with &quot;a&#xD;
      recently established diagnosis of dementia&quot; (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,&#xD;
      Decision Memo CAG-00088R, 2004), but evidence is less clear for patients having less severe&#xD;
      cognitive problems. A substantial portion of such patients will develop Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      and other forms of dementia, which affect millions of people in the U.S., costing us over&#xD;
      $100 billion annually. This project employs a prospective randomized protocol to determine&#xD;
      whether PET scanning can help distinguish those patients with early Alzheimer's changes in&#xD;
      their brains from those having other causes of cognitive impairment more accurately than is&#xD;
      done with current clinical practices alone, and lead to earlier, more effective therapies&#xD;
      which extend patients' abilities to think and function independently.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People experiencing mild cognitive changes represent an epidemiologically major segment of&#xD;
      the geriatric patient population. In the present proposal, we aim to measure how knowledge of&#xD;
      cerebral metabolic information 1) influences working diagnoses and management of patients&#xD;
      being evaluated for symptoms of early cognitive decline, and 2) impacts upon long-term&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, particularly of subjects having metabolic patterns consistent with&#xD;
      presence of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like changes in their brains. A total of 710 patients&#xD;
      suffering from documentable decline of cognitive function in the absence of overt dementia&#xD;
      will be studied at nine U.S. institutions with extensive experience and infrastructure in&#xD;
      place for the evaluation of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, and for neuroimaging.&#xD;
      In this prospective, investigation, subjects will undergo baseline neuropsychologic testing&#xD;
      and neuroimaging with MRI and FDGPET. PET scan reports will be sealed and randomized with&#xD;
      respect to whether they are released to patients' managing physicians at the time of&#xD;
      interpretation, or two years after the time that scanning is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working diagnoses of managing physicians will be recorded, as will the treatment decisions&#xD;
      made by the managing physicians and their patients. Cognitive abilities, functional status,&#xD;
      utilization of healthcare resources, and other clinical and social contact parameters will be&#xD;
      assessed every six months. Our major hypotheses are that among patients whose PET results are&#xD;
      immediately conveyed to their referring physicians, diagnoses and management plans will be&#xD;
      positively affected, leading to more effective utilization of healthcare resources and to&#xD;
      maintenance of cognitive and functional abilities at a higher level. This project will also&#xD;
      provide a rich source of data that can be used to address questions outside of its major&#xD;
      focus (e.g., prognostic accuracy of volumetric MRI data used instead of, or in conjunction&#xD;
      with, FDG-PET data; incremental predictive value of applying statistically parameterizing&#xD;
      and/or quantifying software tools to imaging data).&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive deficit and/or personality change is present, as observable by physician&#xD;
             and/or close contact(s) of the patient; or in the absence of this, the patient&#xD;
             provides a clear history of decline which the patient's physician deems to be&#xD;
             reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If history or neurologic exam reveals findings suspicious for stroke, tumor, bleed,&#xD;
             ictal activity, or hydrocephalus, then CT/MRI and appropriate neurological or&#xD;
             neurosurgical consultation must have been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Standard history, physical, and laboratory screen have been performed to identify&#xD;
             possible presence of depression, substance abuse, malnourishment, medication effects&#xD;
             and interactions, cardiopulmonary compromise, electrolyte/calcium imbalance, anemia,&#xD;
             hypoxemia, infection, thyroid dysfunction, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, or&#xD;
             glucose dysregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any positive findings revealed in 2) or 3) above have been appropriately treated,&#xD;
             wherever possible, but cognitive/behavioral deficit persists post-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects under age 65 will not be recruited, in order to enhance the clinical&#xD;
             relevance of the project by focusing on the age groups in whom serious concerns about&#xD;
             early signs and symptoms of senile onset dementia are most typically emerging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Overt dementia, as discussed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive dysfunction has impaired subject's ability to perform activities of daily&#xD;
             living.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Present or past history of thyroid disease (due to effects of both the disease and&#xD;
             thyroid hormone replacement therapy on brain metabolism that we and others have begun&#xD;
             to identify, but which remain incompletely characterized.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claustrophobia or metal in body or other condition that would preclude PET or MRI from&#xD;
             being acquired, or visual, auditory or motor deficits that would preclude accurate&#xD;
             neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cholinesterase inhibition therapy already initiated.&#xD;
