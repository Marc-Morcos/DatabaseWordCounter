      This study focuses on the population of Alzheimer disease (AD). Based on&#xD;
      Aβ(A)-Tau(T)-Vascular(V)-Neurodegeneration(N) (ATV(N))-AD evaluation system of NIA-AA&#xD;
      Association, it can accurately diagnose and predict early AD. Positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) - magnetic resonance (MR) was used to perform Aβ、Tau molecular imaging, representing A&#xD;
      and T in the system respectively; The quantitative detection of glucose metabolism in the&#xD;
      brain by fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) can reflect the degree of neuronal damage (N); In&#xD;
      addition, PET-MR can be used to synchronously evaluate the patients' vascular comorbidity&#xD;
      (SVD load score) (V). Through the preliminary construction of this system, to clarify the&#xD;
      central deposition pattern of Aβ、tau protein and the characteristics of FDG metabolism; To&#xD;
      clarify the correlation between PET-MR imaging indexes and the progression of early cognitive&#xD;
      impairment in AD, and to clarify the role of degeneration and vascular factors in the&#xD;
      occurrence and development of AD; To provide a preliminary basis for the subsequent&#xD;
      establishment of a molecular imaging model for the prognosis of early AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cognitive impairment disease, which is mainly&#xD;
      manifested in memory loss, language function and logical thinking disorder, and ultimately&#xD;
      leads to the loss of independent living ability of patients. China has become the country&#xD;
      with the largest number of AD patients in the world. At present, it has reached more than 8&#xD;
      million. The AD incidence rate of the elderly over 65 years old is 4%-6%, which seriously&#xD;
      affects the health of the elderly. At present, the medicines used in clinical practice are&#xD;
      only symptomatic treatment, and have no effect on reversing the course of disease. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that AD has a preclinical period of more than 10 years. In this period, patients&#xD;
      have specific pathological changes in the brain, but there are no obvious clinical symptoms.&#xD;
      However, if the intervention is started after significant cognitive impairment, irreversible&#xD;
      changes have taken place in the brain, and the intervention effect is limited. In recent&#xD;
      years, many drug clinical studies on ad specific pathophysiological processes have not&#xD;
      achieved positive results, which may be one of the important reasons why the study failed to&#xD;
      include subjects in the early stage of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, in 2011, the National Institute of Aging and the Alzheimer's Association&#xD;
      (NIA-AA) developed diagnostic criteria for preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI)&#xD;
      due to AD, and dementia due to AD, which are based on AD specific biomarkers, transform the&#xD;
      prenatal diagnosis of AD from clinical symptomatology architecture to central biomarker&#xD;
      architecture (gold standard). The latter refers to β Amyloid protein（Aβ), Phosphorylated tau&#xD;
      (p-tau) and secondary neurodegenerative injury (neurodegeneration), the so-called AT(N)&#xD;
      architecture, in which &quot;A&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are AD specific lesions, and &quot;A&quot; is the earliest landmark&#xD;
      change. Through in vivo detection of AD specific central markers to identify AD as early as&#xD;
      possible and carry out targeted intervention, it is expected to provide the possibility for&#xD;
      AD reversal. On the other hand, it is well known that AD tends to occur in the elderly, and&#xD;
      there are often small vessel disease (SVD) coexisting in varying degrees. Both can work&#xD;
      together to lead to AD progression. How to define the interaction between the two in the&#xD;
      occurrence and progression of disease is also the focus of clinical research on AD. In this&#xD;
      context, the 2018 NIA-AA standard update pointed out that the AT(N) architecture can be&#xD;
      extended according to the AD comorbidity. For example, if AD is complicated with&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease, AT (N) can be correspondingly extended to ATV (N). The international&#xD;
      clinical research based on AT(N) is very limited, while the research on ATV (N) is blank at&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, PET-CT or PET-MR can be used to perform aβ and Tau molecular imaging and FDG-PET&#xD;
      can reflect the damage degree of neurons through the quantitative detection of brain glucose&#xD;
      metabolism, and realize the early accurate individual diagnosis of AD based on AT(N)&#xD;
      architecture. PET-MR can also realize the simultaneous evaluation of patients' vascular&#xD;
      comorbidity. For example, the SVD load score of MRI images is often used in clinical&#xD;
      evaluation. Therefore, PET-MR research is carried out on patients with AD-MCI, It can realize&#xD;
      the early accurate identification and comprehensive evaluation of AD based on AT(V) N&#xD;
      architecture, and help to explore the contribution of degenerative factors and vascular load&#xD;
      to the occurrence and development of cognition. It is a hot spot in clinical research in the&#xD;
      field of AD at present, and it is in urgent need of breakthrough. At present, the research on&#xD;
      the central biomarkers of early clinical AD is very limited, especially the longitudinal&#xD;
      study which is combination of Aβ、 Tau and FDG multimodal PET images.&#xD;
