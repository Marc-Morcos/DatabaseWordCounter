  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to a) assess the feasibility and preliminary validity&#xD;
      of home-based delivery of TeleNP to patients with suspected Alzheimer's Disease (AD),&#xD;
      referred for cognitive assessments in a Neurology Clinic; and b) elucidate whether TeleNP is&#xD;
      equivalent to face-to-face evaluation (FF) for diagnostic adjudication of atypical versus&#xD;
      typical AD.&#xD;

    <description>Neuropsychologist-determined severity (i.e., subjective cognitive concerns; MCI; mild dementia) will be compared across both conditions whether TeleNP alters assessment of patient severity.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability and Feasibility of Intervention Measures as measured by 4-item Acceptability and Feasibility of Intervention Measures Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>After the exposure to each health delivery conditions, Face-to-face evaluation (FF) and TeleNP evaluation, at Week 1 and Weeks 5-7</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-item Acceptability and Feasibility of Intervention Measures Scale is used for rating all participants and care partners' perspective on the acceptability and feasibility of the Face-to-face evaluation (FF) and TeleNP evaluation as assessed using a 5-point Likert scale at Week 1 or Weeks 5-7, depending on randomization. Scores range from &quot;Completely disagree&quot; (1) to &quot;Completely agree&quot; (5).</description>

    <measure>Acceptability and Feasibility of Intervention Measures as Measured by 19-item UTAUT questionnaire adapted to TeleNP</measure>
    <time_frame>After the exposure to the TeleNP evaluation (up to Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>The 19-item UTAUT questionnaire adapted to TeleNP is used for rating all participants and care partners' perspective on the acceptability and feasibility of TeleNP evaluation as assessed using a 5-point Likert scale at Week 1 or Weeks 5-7, depending on randomization. Scores range from &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; (1) to &quot;Strongly agree&quot; (5).</description>

    <measure>User experience of patient and any associated care partners for each health delivery conditions, Face-to-face evaluation (FF) and TeleNP evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after the exposure to each health delivery conditions, Face-to-face evaluation (FF) and TeleNP evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>A subset of diverse patients (n=20) and any associated care partners will be invited to participate in semi-structured interviews with the research coordinator within one week of completing both FF and TeleNP conditions. These interviews will focus on the participant's user experience, guided by UTAUT domains and specific attention to home setting and potential care partner involvement.</description>

    <measure>User experience of neuropsychologist for each health delivery conditions, Face-to-face evaluation (FF) and TeleNP evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two years</time_frame>
    <description>The neuropsychologists will also participate in brief, separate interviews to garner information regarding feasibility, acceptability, and strengths/weaknesses of TeleNP after the completion of 20, 40, 60, and 80 TeleNP evaluations.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to two years</time_frame>
    <description>The psychometrist will also participate in brief, separate interviews to garner information regarding feasibility, acceptability, and strengths/weaknesses of TeleNP; these interviews will be conducted by Dr. Hillary Lum after the completion of 20, 40, 60, and 80 TeleNP evaluations.</description>
