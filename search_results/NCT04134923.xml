  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate adult children of parents with and without&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease which represent an ideal population for investigating the biological&#xD;
      changes that precede the clinical onset of AD. The investigators will be imaging the brain to&#xD;
      detect the presence of amyloid deposits (plaques in the brain). Amyloid is a protein that may&#xD;
      be related to dementia of Alzheimer's disease (DAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a radioactive tracer called [11C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (11C]PIB), which&#xD;
      is a tracer that binds to beta amyloid protein in the brain. This compound is considered&#xD;
      investigational, which means that it has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA).&#xD;

    <description>the annual rate of CDR progression will accelerate due to the aging of the ACS cohort., and estimate that among ~375 ACS participants who either remain CDR 0 currently and will continue to be clinically assessed or will be the new future enrollees, a total of 45 individuals will progress to CDR&gt;0 by the end of next funding cycle.</description>
