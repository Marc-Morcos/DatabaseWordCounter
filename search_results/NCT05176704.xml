    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop and validate a sensitive and non-invasive eye-tracking software&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will obtain participant responses to brief cognitive tests designed to evaluate&#xD;
      several key functions known to be affected by Alzheimer's Disease and non-invasive eye&#xD;
      movement measurements in response to visually presented stimuli during specifically designed&#xD;
      eye-tracking tests. The study data will be used to develop machine learning algorithms and&#xD;
      validate a software application intended to track the progressive component of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease and associated cognitive changes.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score, one time, at the day of enrollment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a global rating scale for staging patients diagnosed with Alzheimer disease and other dementias and monitoring changes in the level of there disabilities over time. The CDR scale is a 0-3 point numeric scale (0.5 unit increments) derived from clinician rating of cognition and daily function in the domains of memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, one time, at the day of enrollment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief 30-question cognitive screening test designed to assist Health Professionals in the detection of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation.&#xD;
Scores on the MoCA range from zero to 30, with a score of 26 and higher generally considered normal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score, one time, at the day of enrollment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) is a widely used test of cognitive function among the elderly, it includes tests of orientation, attention, memory, language and visual-spatial skills. It consists of a series of questions and tests that can be used by clinicians to help diagnose dementia and to help assess its progression and severity.</description>

        For this study, we will recruit 250 participants. 200 will be AD patients (including&#xD;
        predominant AD with mixed vascular and MCI due to AD), who will subsequently be divided&#xD;
        into 4 sub-groups of 50 based on their CDR score (questionable/very mild dementia (CDR =&#xD;
        0.5), mild dementia/MCI (CDR = 1), moderate dementia (CDR = 2), and severe dementia (CDR =&#xD;
        3)), and 50 will be healthy cognitively intact age-matched control participants.&#xD;
