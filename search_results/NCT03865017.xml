    <description>13-item ADAS-Cog assesses a range of cognitive abilities including memory, comprehension, orientation in time and place, and spontaneous speech. Most items are evaluated by tests, but some are dependent on clinician ratings on a 5-point scale. The ADAS-Cog-13 is the ADAS-Cog-11 with 2 additional items: delayed word recall and total digit cancellation. Scores for the ADAS-Cog-13 range from 0 to 85 with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction.</description>
