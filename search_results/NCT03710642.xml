      Prazosin for Disruptive Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease (PEACE-AD) is a Phase IIb&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 12-weeks treatment with&#xD;
      the brain active alpha-1 adrenoreceptor (AR) antagonist prazosin for disruptive agitation in&#xD;
      35 Alzheimer's disease (AD) residents in a long-term care (LTC) setting or living at home&#xD;
      with full-time caregiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distruptive agitation defined as having one or more of the following behaviors nearly daily&#xD;
      during the previous week and at least intermittently for four weeks prior to screening: a)&#xD;
      irritability, b) physically and/or verbally aggressive behavior, c) physically resistive to&#xD;
      necessary care, d) and/or pressured motor activity (e.g., pressured pacing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LTC is defined as assisted living or skilled nursing facility. Home dwelling participants&#xD;
      require full-time caregiving defined as having continuous daily caregiving and a Study&#xD;
      Partner who will assist in providing protocol specific information to the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous single site pilot study addressing disruptive agitation in 22 predominantly&#xD;
      LTC-residing AD participants demonstrated efficacy of prazosin on all three primary outcome&#xD;
      measures.1 The current multicenter study is funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA),&#xD;
      and coordinated through the NIA-funded Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS).&#xD;

    <measure>ADAS-Clinical Global Impression of Change in Agitation (CGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks.Time will be treated as categorical.</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS-CGIC-A is the primary outcome measure. It will be anchored to disruptive agitation, the target behaviors in this study. It measures whether the effects of active treatment are substantial enough to be detected by a skilled and experienced clinician on the basis of a direct examination of the participant and an interview of the participant's primary caregiver and other LTC facility staff. The participant is rated on a 7-point Likert scale. Scores can range from 1 (improvement) to 7 (worsening).</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI was designed to characterize the neuropsychiatric symptoms and psychopathology of patients with AD and other dementias residing in the community about which information was obtained from family caregivers. The content of the questions and their scoring in the NPI-NH are identical to those of the NPI except for some slight rephrasing to be consistent with the LTC environment where information is gathered from professional caregivers. Assessment of the impact of behavioral disturbances on family and professional caregivers, is assessed by a caregiver distress scale in the NPI and an occupational disruptiveness scale in the NPI-NH; scoring of this component remains identical.</description>

    <measure>ADCS-ADL-Severe</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS-ADL-Severe questionnaire is a secondary outcome measure aimed at detecting functional decline in people with severe AD. It was developed as a result of a research project funded by the NIA and conducted by the ADCS to develop cognitive and functional instruments for the assessment of participants with AD with relevance to clinical trials. This scale is best suited for evaluating people with MMSE scores below 15/30, or equivalent. Questions are administered to a qualified caregiver informant about a set of 19 basic and instrumental ADL. Instrumental ADL are selected to be relevant to this level of severity of dementia, e.g., obtaining a beverage, turning lights on and off, turning a faucet on and off. Performance of each of these activities during the past 4 weeks, as well as the level of performance, are rated. A total score is derived by summing scores across items, and ranges from 0 (maximal impairment) to 54 (maximally independent function).</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CMAI is an exploratory outcome measure for estimating frequency of agitated behaviors. The CMAI assesses the frequency of agitated behaviors in elderly persons and was developed for use in the LTC facility. The CMAI will be administered by the Clinician Rater who interviews LTC staff for LTC residents and the Study Partner for home-dwelling participants.The CMAI rates 29 agitated behaviors, each on a 7-point scale of frequency ranging from never to several times per hour. Ratings pertain to the 2-week period preceding the rating. The CMAI will be completed at baseline and study termination.</description>

&#xD;
        Participants must meet all of the following criteria be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men and women with probable or possible AD by NINCDS-ADRDA criteria utilizing history;&#xD;
             medical records review; physical and neurological exam; and laboratory tests (as&#xD;
             applicable). Brain neuroimaging is not a requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants must either reside in an LTC that is associated with the study site or at&#xD;
             home with full-time caregiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must have disruptive agitation significant enough to disrupt caregiving&#xD;
             and, in the opinion of the Site Principal Investigator, to justify treatment.&#xD;
             Disruptive agitation, defined as having any combination of the following target&#xD;
             behaviors, must have occurred nearly daily during the previous week and at least&#xD;
             intermittently for 4 weeks prior to screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. irritability,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. physically and/or verbally aggressive behavior,&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. physical resistiveness to necessary care&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. pressured motor activity (e.g., pressured pacing) These behaviors must be&#xD;
                  problematic in that they cause participant and caregiver distress and/or&#xD;
                  interfere with essential care or disrupt their living environment. Target&#xD;
                  behaviors may be any combination of the listed domains. Disruptive agitation must&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. If taking cholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine, must be on stable dose for 3&#xD;
             months prior t o randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. During the week before randomization, the above-described behaviors of eligible&#xD;
             participants must be rated as of at least moderate severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Data sharing is integral to the ADCS's mission to develop and execute innovative clinical trials focused on interventions that may prevent, delay, or treat the expression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The ADCS is committed to sharing resources and tools, including data, biospecimens, trial designs, outcome and analysis measures following NIH guidelines.&#xD;
DATA SHARING: The ADCS Data and Sample Sharing Committee (DSSC) grants access to de-identified data to individuals who complete the request process and agree to the conditions in an ADCS/UCSD Data Use Agreement (DUA). After approval and receipt of the fully executed DUA, applicants are authorized to acquire data. Non-compliance with the DUA, including the requirement to provide requested updates will jeopardize further access to data.</ipd_description>
