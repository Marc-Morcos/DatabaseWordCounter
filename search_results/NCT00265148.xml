    <measure>Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Global and Regional Indices of Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Glucose (CMRglu) at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Global CMRGlu index was related to grey matter of brain. Regional CMRGlu index was related to assessment of different regions of brain namely posterior cingulate gyrus, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, posterior temporal lobe, cerebellum, and medial temporal lobe. Evaluation of medial temporal lobe CMRGlu included assessment of medial anterior temporal lobe, paraHippocampal Ambiens gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus. The regional CMRGlu index is directly proportional to the true metabolic rate of glucose. Baseline was defined as Day 1 of the 12 months treatment period. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Data has been presented for arithmetic mean; however, statistical analysis has been presented for adjusted or least square (LS) mean.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Delayed Free Recall Words at Months 1, 6, and 12 by Buschke Selective Reminding (BSR) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), and Months 1, 6, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BSR test included evaluating short-term memory of a participant to remember a list of unrelated words, to learn the words over 8 trials and to remember these words over 8 trials, and to remember these words during a 20 minute delay. The number of words recalled in delayed free recalls were analyzed. Other parameters analyzed included number recalled Trial 1 immediate, number recalled Trial 8 immediate, total number for all 8 immediate trials, and total number of uncued words recalled. Higher number of words recalled indicated better short term memory and positive treatment differences in these number of words recalled were indicative of superiority of drug over placebo. Baseline measurement was performed on Day 1. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Statistical analysis is presented for difference of means.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Delayed Free Recall Items Over Period by Stroop Colour Word Interference (SCWI) at Months 1, 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Months1, 6, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>It is a measure of change from Baseline (Day 1) in clinical scale of AD status. A 3-card version test includes all card containing 50 items each. Participants were asked to complete all items and time in seconds was recorded. Participants first read color words printed in black, then named the printed color of the colored patches, and finally named the printed color of the colored words. The word condition was used to verify that participants were able to read colored words and time to perform color condition was considered as ' control'. The dependent variable was the time to complete the interference condition and the test could have presented in pencil and paper or on screen, both the ways. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Statistical analysis is presented for difference of means.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Simplified Spatial Paired Associate Learning (SSPAL) Response Over Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Months 1, 6, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline = value at the indicated time point minus the Baseline(Day1) value. SSPAL is a cognitive test that involves object-location memory and learning. It is used to examine cognitive deficits in AD. Participants were asked to sit 50 cm away from screen and different pictures (target and distracter) were shown on a monitor. Responses were acquired from response box. Participants were informed by visual feedback whether the response was correct or incorrect and the accuracy was collected automatically. SSPAL responses were captured as new accuracy and global accuracy. New accuracy was defined as proportion of accurate responses per participant for recall of any new item (picture). Global accuracy was defined as proportion of accurate responses per participant for recall of all new items and their displayed locations (i.e. right or left position on the screen). The possible range for new and global accuracy is 0(worst) to 1(best). Higher values indicate better performance.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Accuracy by Choice Reaction Time (CRT) Test Over Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A motor reaction task was presented 4 runs of 50 trials each. In each trial, presentation of a central crosshair for 200 milliseconds (ms) was followed by display of a grey square for 800 ms. The square appeared in two of five possible positions relative to the crosshair (leftmost or rightmost). When the grey square became white, the participant was trained to press the a button. In each trial of the Simple Reaction Time Task, presentation of a central crosshair for 200 ms was followed by display of one square for 800 ms. For both simple and choice versions of the task, trial duration was 4000 ms maximum. The participant was immediately informed (by color changes of the white square) whether the response to each trial was correct or incorrect, and accuracy and reaction time (RT) are automatically calculated. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Global and Regional Indices of Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Glucose (CMRglu) at Month 12</title>
        <description>Global CMRGlu index was related to grey matter of brain. Regional CMRGlu index was related to assessment of different regions of brain namely posterior cingulate gyrus, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, posterior temporal lobe, cerebellum, and medial temporal lobe. Evaluation of medial temporal lobe CMRGlu included assessment of medial anterior temporal lobe, paraHippocampal Ambiens gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus. The regional CMRGlu index is directly proportional to the true metabolic rate of glucose. Baseline was defined as Day 1 of the 12 months treatment period. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Data has been presented for arithmetic mean; however, statistical analysis has been presented for adjusted or least square (LS) mean.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Delayed Free Recall Words at Months 1, 6, and 12 by Buschke Selective Reminding (BSR) Test</title>
        <description>The BSR test included evaluating short-term memory of a participant to remember a list of unrelated words, to learn the words over 8 trials and to remember these words over 8 trials, and to remember these words during a 20 minute delay. The number of words recalled in delayed free recalls were analyzed. Other parameters analyzed included number recalled Trial 1 immediate, number recalled Trial 8 immediate, total number for all 8 immediate trials, and total number of uncued words recalled. Higher number of words recalled indicated better short term memory and positive treatment differences in these number of words recalled were indicative of superiority of drug over placebo. Baseline measurement was performed on Day 1. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Statistical analysis is presented for difference of means.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Delayed Free Recall Items Over Period by Stroop Colour Word Interference (SCWI) at Months 1, 6 and 12</title>
        <description>It is a measure of change from Baseline (Day 1) in clinical scale of AD status. A 3-card version test includes all card containing 50 items each. Participants were asked to complete all items and time in seconds was recorded. Participants first read color words printed in black, then named the printed color of the colored patches, and finally named the printed color of the colored words. The word condition was used to verify that participants were able to read colored words and time to perform color condition was considered as ' control'. The dependent variable was the time to complete the interference condition and the test could have presented in pencil and paper or on screen, both the ways. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Statistical analysis is presented for difference of means.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Delayed Free Recall Items Over Period by Stroop Colour Word Interference (SCWI) at Months 1, 6 and 12</title>
          <description>It is a measure of change from Baseline (Day 1) in clinical scale of AD status. A 3-card version test includes all card containing 50 items each. Participants were asked to complete all items and time in seconds was recorded. Participants first read color words printed in black, then named the printed color of the colored patches, and finally named the printed color of the colored words. The word condition was used to verify that participants were able to read colored words and time to perform color condition was considered as ' control'. The dependent variable was the time to complete the interference condition and the test could have presented in pencil and paper or on screen, both the ways. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Statistical analysis is presented for difference of means.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Simplified Spatial Paired Associate Learning (SSPAL) Response Over Period</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline = value at the indicated time point minus the Baseline(Day1) value. SSPAL is a cognitive test that involves object-location memory and learning. It is used to examine cognitive deficits in AD. Participants were asked to sit 50 cm away from screen and different pictures (target and distracter) were shown on a monitor. Responses were acquired from response box. Participants were informed by visual feedback whether the response was correct or incorrect and the accuracy was collected automatically. SSPAL responses were captured as new accuracy and global accuracy. New accuracy was defined as proportion of accurate responses per participant for recall of any new item (picture). Global accuracy was defined as proportion of accurate responses per participant for recall of all new items and their displayed locations (i.e. right or left position on the screen). The possible range for new and global accuracy is 0(worst) to 1(best). Higher values indicate better performance.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Accuracy by Choice Reaction Time (CRT) Test Over Period</title>
        <description>A motor reaction task was presented 4 runs of 50 trials each. In each trial, presentation of a central crosshair for 200 milliseconds (ms) was followed by display of a grey square for 800 ms. The square appeared in two of five possible positions relative to the crosshair (leftmost or rightmost). When the grey square became white, the participant was trained to press the a button. In each trial of the Simple Reaction Time Task, presentation of a central crosshair for 200 ms was followed by display of one square for 800 ms. For both simple and choice versions of the task, trial duration was 4000 ms maximum. The participant was immediately informed (by color changes of the white square) whether the response to each trial was correct or incorrect, and accuracy and reaction time (RT) are automatically calculated. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. ADAS-COG is a 13 item, 11 questionnaire assessment of range of cognitive abilities including memory, comprehension, orientation in time and place, and spontaneous speech. The scale ranges from 0 to 70, with negative changes from Baseline indicating the improvement and positive changes indicating worsening of condition. Arithmetic means are presented as raw data; however, statistical analysis is based on LS means.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Scale (ADAS-COG) Total Score Over Period</title>
          <description>Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. ADAS-COG is a 13 item, 11 questionnaire assessment of range of cognitive abilities including memory, comprehension, orientation in time and place, and spontaneous speech. The scale ranges from 0 to 70, with negative changes from Baseline indicating the improvement and positive changes indicating worsening of condition. Arithmetic means are presented as raw data; however, statistical analysis is based on LS means.</description>

        <description>The CBIC+ assessment for global functioning consists of a 7 point rating scale of severity and change with 1 indicating marked improvement and 7 indicating marked worsening. This scale was used to analyze clinically relevant effect. This was supposed to be performed by an independent investigator who is not a part of the ongoing study. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. This scale was used to decide clinical status of AD. Arithmetic means are presented as raw data; however, statistical analysis has been presented for LS means.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory Score Over Period</title>
        <description>The NPI assesses the frequency and severity of behavioral disturbances in dementia across 10 domains. The total NPI score was calculated by adding all individual domains cores. The scale ranges from 0 to 120 , 0 indicating no / least burden and 120 indicating maximum burden. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement. Baseline measurement was performed on Day 1. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>This is a measure of assessing insulin sensitivity. HOMA IR was calculated by multiplying fasting insulin by fasting plasma glucose and dividing the multiplied digit by 22.5. All samples were collected under fasting condition. Baseline measurement was performed on Day 1. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Adverse event (AE) is an unfavorable change in the health of a participant, including abnormal laboratory findings, that happens during a clinical study or within a certain time period after the study has ended. This change may or may not be caused by the intervention being studied. Serious adverse event (SAE) is an adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or extends a current hospital stay, results in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interferes substantially with normal life functions, or causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events if they put the participant in danger or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above.</description>

          <population>PGx ITT population included all participants in ITT population who had evaluable PGx data (who consented to genotyping, provided an identified blood sample for genotyping and were successfully genotyped for at least one of the genetic markers under study. Only the participants available at the time of assessment were analyzed.</population>
