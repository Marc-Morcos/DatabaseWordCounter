  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-11-item Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog11) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline at week 12 is assessed for ADAS-Cog11 score. The ADAS-Cog11 is a structured scale that evaluates memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and constructional praxis. ADAS-Cog11 measures cognition by assessing 11 metrics impaired in AD: word recall; commands; constructional praxis; naming objects and fingers; ideational praxis; orientation; word recognition; remembering test instructions; spoken language ability; word-finding difficulty; and comprehension of spoken language. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~ 14 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Medication due to an Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~ 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) Overall Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ADCS-CGIC scores are assessed at week 12. The ADCS-CGIC is a global scale assessing cognition and function based on structured interviews of both the participant and study partner. The ADCS-CGIC focuses on clinicians' observations of change in the patient's cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of the study. Improvement in the ADCS-CGIC overall score, with a score of 1, 2, or 3 indicates improvement. The ADCS-CGIC is a clinician-rated measure of: global severity at baseline scored from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients); and global change at follow-up scored from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening), where 4 indicates no change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Total Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline at week 12 is assessed for ADCS-ADL score. The ADCS-ADL is an informant-based measure of the patient's functional ability in activities of daily living (ADL). The ADCS-ADL assesses the competence of participants with AD dementia in basic and instrumental ADLs. The ADCS-ADL is a 23 item scale that includes 6 basic ADL tems and 17 instrumental ADL items that provide a total score from 0-78, with a lower score indicating greater severity.</description>
