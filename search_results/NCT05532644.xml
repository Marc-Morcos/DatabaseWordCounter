  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of the proposed study concerns the understanding of the way in which each drug&#xD;
      acts in each organism separately, both at the genome level and at the microbiome level. It is&#xD;
      often observed that various treatments do not have the expected results in all patients,&#xD;
      while, at the same time, new pathophysiological mechanisms for each disease are found. The&#xD;
      involvement of the intestinal microbiome is one of these mechanisms and as it affects not&#xD;
      only the progression of the disease but also the way in which drugs are metabolized (hence&#xD;
      their action) should now be considered in every possible case. This led to the emergence of a&#xD;
      new field of study related to personalized medicine, pharmacomicrobiomics. It includes&#xD;
      microbiology, genomics, and pharmacology, and studies the changes that the human microbiome&#xD;
      shows in drug exposure, action, and toxicity. However, this field is relatively new, and&#xD;
      although there have been several reports of microbial biotransformation, there has been&#xD;
      little in-depth research into the specificity of bacterial strains or the factors that can&#xD;
      predict drug transformations. Therefore, this study will give the impetus for the&#xD;
      individualized treatment, which will not only concern the genome (which is constantly&#xD;
      evolving in recent years) but also the intestinal microbiome, which as mentioned above, is&#xD;
      involved in many pathological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a considerable number of studies have focused on the relationship between the&#xD;
      microbiome and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), we have not seen any studies on&#xD;
      the effect of drugs currently used in the treatment of AD (which are primarily cholinesterase&#xD;
      inhibitors), such as rivastigmine, galantamine and donepezil and the NMDA&#xD;
      (N-methyl-D-aspartate) glutamate receptor antagonist (memantine). There is also no reference&#xD;
      to the composition and / or activity of the microbiome or to the effect of the latter on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and / or pharmacodynamics of these drugs. Also, although the human&#xD;
      microbiome is influenced by genetic factors in the body, the effect of polymorphisms on the&#xD;
      P-gp gene, which is involved in the pathophysiology of AD, the microbiome or its metabolites,&#xD;
      has not been studied.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study, the patients will be divided into those receiving cholinesterase&#xD;
      inhibitors (rivastigmine, galantamine and donepezil) and those receiving NMDA receptor&#xD;
      antagonist therapy (memantine), based on the treatment they follow for AD. . A medical&#xD;
      history of patients and controls, neuropsychological assessments using the respective&#xD;
      questionnaires used in AD (which will be repeated at the end of the study-3 months) and a&#xD;
      stool sample will be taken. Finally, a blood sample will be taken at the beginning of&#xD;
      treatment to study P-gp ABCB1 gene polymorphisms and RLs and LPSs levels, and one at the end&#xD;
      of the study to examinate drug levels RLs and LPSs levels in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the required number of samples (patients and controls) the collection of these will&#xD;
      last 6 months. Laboratory tests will take place in the next 12 months. Therefore, the main&#xD;
      part of the study (sampling, laboratory analyzes) is expected to be completed in 18 months,&#xD;
      while the stage of processing, analysis and verification of results is expected to last 6&#xD;
      months. The total duration of the study is expected to be 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      135 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  45 patients receiving treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine,&#xD;
           galantamine and donepezil).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  45 patients receiving NMDA receptor antagonist (memantine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  45 healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Eligibility Screening Form (ESF):&#xD;
&#xD;
      An eligibility form documenting the patient's fulfillment of the entry criteria will be&#xD;
      completed by the assessor. The following information will be included in the ESF:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient identification: Initials (First initial of first name and first initial of&#xD;
           surname), date of birth and Patient Identification Number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written informed consent will be obtained from the subject. The informed consent form&#xD;
           must be co-signed by the physician. The nature of the study and the potential risks&#xD;
           associated with the trial will be explained to all subject candidates and their&#xD;
           responsible informants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signature and date: the ESF may be completed by an assessor but it is required that the&#xD;
           principal investigator/study clinician sign and date the ESF to verify eligibility of&#xD;
           the patient for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient who will participate in the study there should be a record of personal&#xD;
      history that will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Place of residence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eating habits (Mediterranean diet will be recommended)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication followed in the last year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other pathological conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neuropsychological assessment will include the following questionnaires, which are&#xD;
      validated in Greek elderly population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Geriatrics Depression Scale (GDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional or Cognitive Assessment scale (FUCAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The finding of P-gp ABCB1 gene polymorphisms will be performed with isolation of DNA&#xD;
           with appropriate kits from the blood sample and will follow PCR technique with suitable&#xD;
           primers and DNA electrophoresis or techniques real time PCR (taqman assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Levels of RLs and LPs will be measured by the method ELISA and the use of corresponding&#xD;
           antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug levels in the blood will be measured by fluid high performance chromatography&#xD;
           coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC / MS).&#xD;
