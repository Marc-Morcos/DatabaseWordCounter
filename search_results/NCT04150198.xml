  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Alzheimer's disease and with early onset of symptoms (&lt;65 years) (AD-Y) have a&#xD;
      multi-domain cognitive deficit, whereas memory disorders (typical of the elderly patient's&#xD;
      AD) are less often in the foreground. In addition, some MA-J have an atypical phenotype&#xD;
      indicating focal brain damage, although they have the same pathological lesions: amyloid&#xD;
      deposits and tau protein deposition (DNF). This is the case of posterior cortical atrophy&#xD;
      (PCA) characterized by complex visual disturbances and atrophy affecting the more posterior&#xD;
      regions of the brain. Based on the clinical profile of PCA patients, a more refined&#xD;
      anatomo-clinical classification was proposed, distinguishing a rather &quot;ventral&quot; form and a&#xD;
      rather &quot;dorsal&quot; form. The recent arrival of tau-specific PET tracers now makes it possible to&#xD;
      evaluate in vivo fibrillary neurodegeneration (FND), which is well correlated with the&#xD;
      severity of cognitive disorders. Advances in MRI have shown that each neurodegenerative&#xD;
      syndrome targets a large-scale neural network, which in turn shows a vulnerability for a&#xD;
      specific biological disease. In the case of AD, the reason for such a difference in cognitive&#xD;
      and anatomical impairment between patients with diffuse involvement and others with more&#xD;
      focal involvement is not known. One possible explanation is the existence, in focal forms, of&#xD;
      neuronal mechanisms that oppose vulnerability. These mechanisms may correspond to the&#xD;
      so-called &quot;resilience&quot; phenomenon, defined as resistance to a neuropathological process by&#xD;
      the ability to optimize cognitive performance via the efficient recruitment of neural&#xD;
      networks. The mechanisms underlying resilience in neurodegeneration are unknown. Their&#xD;
      identification is very important for the management and treatment of AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Working hypotheses We hypothesize that &quot;focal&quot; patients (PCA) versus &quot;diffuse&quot; patients&#xD;
      (AD-Y) have (i) less severe white matter involvement; (ii) effective reorganization of the&#xD;
      functional brain networks; iii) pathologically, a different topography and lesion load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has no redundancy with the work already done in our team and in other teams at&#xD;
      the international level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits This study will highlight the neural mechanisms underlying resiliency in a&#xD;
      group of AD patients who, although having the same disease, present with a very different&#xD;
      clinical and cognitive profile. Demonstration of these specific mechanisms of resilience in&#xD;
      the diseased brain is essential to better understand the pathophysiological processes of AD.&#xD;
      We consider that the pharmacological approach and the functional reeducation to this disease&#xD;
      depend essentially on a better knowledge of both the topographic distribution of the&#xD;
      underlying histopathology (in particular, the tau protein), and the response capacity from&#xD;
      the brain to these lesions (state of connection of networks, functional reorganization). In&#xD;
      addition, when treatments for AD are available, a precise definition of phenotypic variants&#xD;
      will be essential for the selection of patients for these therapies and for therapeutic&#xD;
      follow-up. In the longer term, resilient neural circuits could be modulated and strengthened&#xD;
      through transcranial stimulation. Indeed, promising results have been obtained showing that&#xD;
      these techniques can improve the performance of altered cognitive functions in patients with&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For all subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Affiliation to a social security insurance or beneficiary&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Informed consent form signed by the participant or his / her legal representative&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants aged 40 to 80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Selection of AD-Y group&#xD;
&#xD;
             - In vivo proof of Alzheimer's pathology:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Determination of specific proteins on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, a routine&#xD;
                  care procedure). The values considered pathological (AD) are Aβ1-42 peptide &lt;500&#xD;
                  (μg / ml), and / or tau protein&gt; 450 and phosphorylated tau protein&gt; 60, IATI&#xD;
                  index &lt;1, tau / Aβ protein ratios &gt; 1.23 as well as phosphorylated tau protein /&#xD;
                  Aβ1-42&gt; 0.211.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  And / or a positive PET-amyloid imaging test.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Early-onset episodic memory deficit (&lt;65 years), progressive onset with evidence&#xD;
                  of hippocampal amnesic syndrome at neuropsychological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             In memory tests, the amnesic hippocampal syndrome is defined by: a deficit of the free&#xD;
             recall despite a reinforced encoding, an effectiveness of the indexing or an&#xD;
             impairment of the recognition capabilities, the presence of intrusions. The presence&#xD;
             during the tests of false memories spontaneous (intrusions) or provoked (false&#xD;
             recognitions) is also very contributive to the definition of amnesic syndrome of the&#xD;
             hippocampal type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. PCA group selection&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients with a clinical and cognitive profile suggestive of PCA, characterized by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  an in vivo proof of the Alzheimer pathology (see selection of the AD-Y group)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a specific impairment of neuro-visual abilities, in the absence of major&#xD;
                  disorders of episodic memory (hippocampal) and executive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Two possible variants:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  occipito-temporal variant: visuo-perceptive deficit in the foreground, early&#xD;
                  onset and progressive worsening; lack of visual identification of objects,&#xD;
                  symbols, words or faces;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  biparietal variant: visuospatial deficit in the foreground, early settlement and&#xD;
                  progressive worsening; Gerstmann syndrome; Balint syndrome; gestural apraxia;&#xD;
                  visual-spatial neglect.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Selection of the control subjects group&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Normal neurological and neuropsychological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Control subjects will be matched in age to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. General non-inclusion criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
             For precautions of safety of use of the radiopharmaceutical, a blood sample allowing&#xD;
             to check the renal and hepatic functions will be realized before imagery. The delay&#xD;
             between the sampling and the neuroimaging visit is left to the investigator's&#xD;
             discretion based on the patient's biological results. In particular, the glomerular&#xD;
             filtration rate will be calculated from the results obtained.&#xD;

             or any other biological anomaly of grade 3 or higher detected during these analyzes,&#xD;
             the participant will not be able to carry out PET imaging. In this case, the results&#xD;
             of the analyzes will be sent to the doctor indicated by the participant. This&#xD;
             evaluation, which involves a determination of serum creatinine, is part of the&#xD;
             standard routine biological assessment performed in the context of cognitive disorders&#xD;

                  implanted equipment activated by an electrical, magnetic or mechanical system,&#xD;

                  higher&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Person suffering from claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnancy (for women of childbearing age, a urine pregnancy test will be&#xD;
                  performed on the day of the inclusion visit and the PET-MRI examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any symptoms or biological values suggestive of a systemic disorder (renal,&#xD;
                  hepatic, cardiovascular, pulmonary) or any other medical conditions that could&#xD;
                  interfere with the interpretation of test results or compromise the health of&#xD;
                  patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Person subject to a legal safeguard.&#xD;
