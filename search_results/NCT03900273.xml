  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol focuses on novel measures of cognition and everyday function that have robust&#xD;
      psychometrics and reduced practiced effects. They will be deployed in a parallel group study&#xD;
      in which participants are randomized to assessment type (novel vs established) and receive&#xD;
      serial assessments over a one year period in order to highlight contrasts between novel and&#xD;
      established measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol has the goal of validating novel cognitive and everyday functional measures&#xD;
      that have sharply attenuated practice effects and are not prone to ceiling effects for use in&#xD;
      preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) trials in which participants are cognitively within&#xD;
      normal limits. To implement this, we will conduct an innovative parallel group study in which&#xD;
      400 healthy, non-cognitively impaired older subjects are randomized to one of two groups&#xD;
      based on assessment type (novel instruments vs. established) and receive three serial&#xD;
      assessments over a one year period. Novel cognitive measures include tests of executive&#xD;
      function, episodic memory, and processing speed combined into a single composite. Novel&#xD;
      functional measures involve computerized performance based, ecologically relevant&#xD;
      instrumental activities. We will compare our novel No Practice Effects (NPE) cognitive&#xD;
      battery and Miami Computerized Functional Assessment Scale (CFAS) against established&#xD;
      measures that include the ADAS-COG in order to determine which battery (novel or established)&#xD;
      has better psychometric properties and is less sensitive to practice effects in this clinical&#xD;
      trials structure.&#xD;

    <description>Novel computerized measure of everyday function. Testing format is a set of simulations (ATM use, Kiosk ticket purchase , Prescription refill , and Doctor's visit ). We will construct a z score based on the &quot;rate&quot; measure which accounts for both speed and accuracy. Higher scores suggest greater cognitive function while lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.</description>

    <description>Novel measure of cognitive function. Scores can be age-adjusted by decade. The majority of the subtests ( including tests of Cognitive Control/Executive Processes, Working Memory,Speed of Processing,Verbal Fluency and Episodic Memory)are computerized or partially computerized. All tests have three equivalent alternate forms. We will construct a z-score averaged composite based on scores of the subtests at baseline. Higher scores suggest greater cognitive function while lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.</description>
