  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NorAD is a clinical trial funded by the UK National Institute of Health Research. In this&#xD;
      trial the investigators will assess whether a long-acting preparation of guanfacine, a drug&#xD;
      used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in children, can improve thinking&#xD;
      (particularly attention) in Alzheimer's Disease when it is added to the standard&#xD;
      NICE-approved drugs that are normally used in this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of extended-release&#xD;
      guanfacine as an add-on therapy in AD, and whether it improves cognition compared to standard&#xD;
      cholinergic therapy alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence suggesting that both noradrenaline and acetylcholine have key roles to play&#xD;
      in attention. Guanfacine acts by increasing levels of noradrenaline, a substance in the brain&#xD;
      which is closely linked with attention, both noradrenaline levels and attentional performance&#xD;
      have been shown to be reduced in Alzheimer's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators propose that modulation of the noradrenergic deficit that has&#xD;
      been described in Alzheimer's Disease in addition to standard cholinergic treatment could&#xD;
      have significant positive effects on cognition, particularly in those patients who suffer&#xD;
      from attentional impairments. The investigators want to assess whether long-acting guanfacine&#xD;
      should be used in addition to NICE-approved drugs that are currently being used in AD as part&#xD;
      of combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a single-centre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind controlled Phase 3 trial to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of standard cholinergic therapy (Donepezil, Rivastigmine or Galantamine)&#xD;
      plus extended release guanfacine (2mg GXR) versus standard cholinergic therapy plus placebo&#xD;
      on Cognition (as measured by the ADAS-Cog) in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial, which will recruit 160 patients (80 randomised to GXR add-on therapy and 80&#xD;
      randomised to placebo), based at Imperial College London - Imperial College Healthcare NHS&#xD;
      Trust.&#xD;
