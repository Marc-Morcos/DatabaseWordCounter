      Dementia refers to a condition in which individuals with brain damage have multiple cognitive&#xD;
      deficits with impairment in activities of daily living (ADL). Therefore, the assessment of&#xD;
      ADL is one of the main criteria for evaluating dementia. ADL disorders are often observed by&#xD;
      caregivers before they are identified by psychometric testing, thus suggesting that ADL&#xD;
      assessment can contribute to the early detection of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of ADL has become increasingly important with the introduction of new drugs for&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as being a helpful tool in diagnosis. Current guidelines&#xD;
      have recognized the need for therapeutic intervention in AD to measure and document treatment&#xD;
      effects on ADL. It has been emphasized that internationally validated and approved test tools&#xD;
      to evaluate dementia are important for multinational clinical drug trials that evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of anti-dementia drugs. Therefore, it is of great importance to find ADL scales that&#xD;
      can be used internationally. Various ADL scales have been developed, such as Lawton's&#xD;
      instrumental ADL (IADL), functional activities questionnaire (FAQ), ADCS-ADL, and Bayer ADL&#xD;
      (B-ADL). Of these, W-ADL was developed based on an international pilot study to evaluate ADL&#xD;
      deficits in patients from different cultural backgrounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, through a collaborative study conducted in four different countries during the&#xD;
      development of the RDA, the researchers prepared 141 items and selected 25 of them that could&#xD;
      be used internationally. The target group of the scale included elderly patients suffering&#xD;
      from mild to moderate dementia or cognitive impairment. European countries: In the United&#xD;
      Kingdom, Germany, and Spain, the validation study of the B-ADL was carried out in three&#xD;
      stages. The aim of our research is to verify the validity and reliability of the Turkish&#xD;
      version of B-ADL.&#xD;

    <description>For the first time, Folstein et al. [12] and found to be valid and reliable in the diagnosis of mild dementia in the Turkish population will be used. SMMT, which measures mental state, is a scale that evaluates cognitive functions in five separate sections (orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language). The test can be easily applied in daily medical practice and is very suitable for screening cognitive function in the elderly. The total score is 30. The cut-off point of the scale was determined as 24.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Dementia Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale was developed by Woolf in 2016 in order to have information about the participant's memory, orientation, judgment and problem-solving ability, functionality outside the home, home life, hobbies and personal care. An evaluation will be made by asking detailed questions about all the areas specified in this test, which will be applied to the patient and their relatives. According to the answers given in each field, it will be scored as 0-0.5-1-2-3 by using the score table in the front of the test. It is a general assessment made to determine the dementia stage of the person. 0.5-1 mild, 1-2 moderate, 2-3 advanced stages of dementia.</description>
