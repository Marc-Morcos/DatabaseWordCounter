    <textblock>
      How do different health self-management interventions (resourcefulness training or&#xD;
      biofeedback training) compare to usual care (dementia education) in affecting the health&#xD;
      risks, and physical and mental health, of family caregivers of people with dementia? And, how&#xD;
      do those health outcomes compare with similar measures for family caregivers of people with&#xD;
      bipolar disorder? This one-year supplement study will exam these two aims as part of a larger&#xD;
      four-year parent grant (NCT03023332). Caregivers enrolled in the study will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of the three self-management interventions, with two data collections time points pre-&#xD;
      and post-intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With every passing minute, a family member in the United States becomes an informal caregiver&#xD;
      for an elder with Alzheimer's disease or another related dementia, which can be highly&#xD;
      distressing and adversely affect the caregiver's mental and physical health. Similar to&#xD;
      caregivers of persons with bipolar disorder, who are currently participating in the parent&#xD;
      study for which this supplement is proposed, caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's or&#xD;
      related dementia have been found to experience greater distress than caregivers of persons&#xD;
      with other chronic conditions. They have significantly more mental and physical health&#xD;
      problems than the general population, leading to greater use of mental health and primary&#xD;
      care services and resulting in their inability to continue to provide care for their family&#xD;
      members. Thus, although the trajectories of the two conditions (bipolar disorder versus&#xD;
      dementia) may differ, we propose that caregivers of persons with dementia may benefit&#xD;
      similarly from tailored health self-management interventions, including resourcefulness&#xD;
      skills or biofeedback training, more than the educational materials or programs they are&#xD;
      typically offered. Therefore, the caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease or related&#xD;
      dementia to be sampled in this administrative supplement will comprise an additional study&#xD;
      arm for the randomized controlled trial constituting the parent study. They will be&#xD;
      randomized to: 1) usual care (education program), 2) resourcefulness training, or 3)&#xD;
      biofeedback. Three outcomes (health risk, mental health, and physical health) will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the effectiveness of resourcefulness training and biofeedback versus usual care&#xD;
           (education program) in family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease or related&#xD;
           dementia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the effects of usual care, resourcefulness training, and biofeedback obtained in&#xD;
           caregivers of persons with dementia with those of the caregivers of persons with bipolar&#xD;
           disorder from the parent study; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore differences between the two types of caregivers on their needs (determined by&#xD;
           their lowest baseline cut score on measures of knowledge, resourcefulness, and heart&#xD;
           rate variability) and preferences (determined by asking which intervention they would&#xD;
           have chosen) among education, resourcefulness training, or biofeedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated measures analyses and descriptive statistics will address the study aims. Our&#xD;
      findings will generate new scientific knowledge about the effectiveness of novel, easy to&#xD;
      use, independently performed interventions that can be individualized and self-tailored to&#xD;
      promote the health of Alzheimer's caregivers and other comparably distressed family&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;

    <description>Use of a heart-rate variability (HRV) tracking device to enable one to learn to alter physiology to improve health. Devices are used to measure physiological activity, e.g., breathing and heart function, and provide rapid, accurate &quot;feedback&quot; to the user, thereby enabling desired physiological changes that can endure over time without continued use of the device and to continue to influence behavior.</description>
