  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of gantenerumab (RO4909832) on cognition and functioning and the safety&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics in participants with prodromal Alzheimer's Disease. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of either gantenerumab or placebo.&#xD;
      Participants who consent to be part of the sub study will undergo positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) scanning to assess brain amyloid. The anticipated time on study treatment is&#xD;
      104 weeks in Part 1, with an option for an additional up to 2 years of treatment in Part 2,&#xD;
      followed by an open-label extension (Part 3) until July 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing for Parts 1 and 2 was stopped after a planned futility interim analysis showed a&#xD;
      low probability of meeting the primary outcome measure with the doses studied. The study has&#xD;
      converted to open-label to investigate higher gantenerumab doses.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) Total Score at Week 104 (Double-Blind Treatment Phase)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating) is obtained through semi-structured interviews of participants and informants, and cognitive functioning is rated in six domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on a five-point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment. The CDR-SOB (Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes) is based on summing each of the domain box scores with total scores ranging from 0-18, where lower total scores represent better outcomes and higher total scores represent worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (OLE Phase)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up until a maximum of 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAS-Cog-11 assesses multiple cognitive domains including memory, comprehension, praxis, orientation, and spontaneous speech. Most of these are assessed by tests although some are rated by the clinician on a 5-point scale. The score range for ADAS-Cog-11 is from 0 to 70 with higher scores representing severe dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) Score at Week 104 (Double-Blind Treatment Phase)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>FCSRT assesses verbal episodic memory. Performances in free recalls, cued recalls and in a recognition task were analyzed, as the process of encoding is controlled. Participants were asked to remember a list of 16 words. Three tasks of free and cued recalls, as well as 1 recognition task and one delayed recall give the scores. Total recall was obtained by the addition of cued recalls to free recalls. Maximum score is 48 for immediate: 16 words multiplied by (*) 3 corresponding to immediate free recall + immediate cued recall + immediate recognition test. Maximum score is 64 (better score) when delayed recall: 16 words*4. The minimum score is 0 (worse).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Questionnaire Score at Week 104 (Double-Blind Treatment Phase)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI is a retrospective (to 1 month) caregiver-informant interview assessing frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric symptom domains. The NPI score is based on the sum of the severity ratings (0=absent, 1=mild, 3=severe). The 12 symptom domains include delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, euphoria/elation, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behaviors, nighttime behavioral disturbances, and appetite/eating abnormalities. The NPI severity score is based on severity ratings (0=absent, 1=mild to 3=severe).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) Total Score at Week 104 (Double-Blind Treatment Phase)</title>
        <description>The CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating) is obtained through semi-structured interviews of participants and informants, and cognitive functioning is rated in six domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on a five-point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment. The CDR-SOB (Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes) is based on summing each of the domain box scores with total scores ranging from 0-18, where lower total scores represent better outcomes and higher total scores represent worse outcomes.</description>

        <population>The Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population was defined as all participants who had received any dose of study treatment and had at least one post-baseline assessment of CDR-SOB. Data presented below is only for participants included in the actual analysis.</population>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) Total Score at Week 104 (Double-Blind Treatment Phase)</title>
          <description>The CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating) is obtained through semi-structured interviews of participants and informants, and cognitive functioning is rated in six domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on a five-point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment. The CDR-SOB (Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes) is based on summing each of the domain box scores with total scores ranging from 0-18, where lower total scores represent better outcomes and higher total scores represent worse outcomes.</description>
          <population>The Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population was defined as all participants who had received any dose of study treatment and had at least one post-baseline assessment of CDR-SOB. Data presented below is only for participants included in the actual analysis.</population>

        <description>An Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Composite Score at Week 104 (Double-Blind Treatment Phase)</title>
          <description>The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) ® is a cognitive test battery that incorporates a variety of executive and memory tasks in order to assess neuropsychological function. The end outcome as reported below, is a Z-Composite Score. The score range of the Z-Composite Score is from (-) infinity to (+) infinity with a score of zero representing the population mean, lower (negative) scores representing poorer cognitive outcomes and higher (positive) scores representing better cognitive outcomes.</description>

        <description>FCSRT assesses verbal episodic memory. Performances in free recalls, cued recalls and in a recognition task were analyzed, as the process of encoding is controlled. Participants were asked to remember a list of 16 words. Three tasks of free and cued recalls, as well as 1 recognition task and one delayed recall give the scores. Total recall was obtained by the addition of cued recalls to free recalls. Maximum score is 48 for immediate: 16 words multiplied by (*) 3 corresponding to immediate free recall + immediate cued recall + immediate recognition test. Maximum score is 64 (better score) when delayed recall: 16 words*4. The minimum score is 0 (worse).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Questionnaire Score at Week 104 (Double-Blind Treatment Phase)</title>
        <description>The NPI is a retrospective (to 1 month) caregiver-informant interview assessing frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric symptom domains. The NPI score is based on the sum of the severity ratings (0=absent, 1=mild, 3=severe). The 12 symptom domains include delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, euphoria/elation, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behaviors, nighttime behavioral disturbances, and appetite/eating abnormalities. The NPI severity score is based on severity ratings (0=absent, 1=mild to 3=severe).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) Score at Week 104 (Double-Blind Treatment Phase)</title>
        <description>The MMSE is a brief, practical screening test for cognitive dysfunction. The test consists of five sections (orientation, registration, attention-calculation, recall, and language); the total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function. A positive change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

        <description>Participants were considered positive or negative for ADA based on their baseline and post-baseline sample results. The number and percentage of participants with confirmed positive ADA levels were determined for Gantenerumab and Placebo groups. The prevalence of ADA at baseline was calculated as the proportion of participants with confirmed positive ADA levels at baseline relative to the total number of participants with a sample available at baseline. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs was determined as the proportion of participants with confirmed post-baseline positive ADAs relative to the total number of participants that had at least one post-baseline sample available for ADA analysis.</description>

        <description>The ADAS-Cog-11 assesses multiple cognitive domains including memory, comprehension, praxis, orientation, and spontaneous speech. Most of these are assessed by tests although some are rated by the clinician on a 5-point scale. The score range for ADAS-Cog-11 is from 0 to 70 with higher scores representing severe dysfunction.</description>

        <description>The CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating) is obtained through semi-structured interviews of participants and informants, and cognitive functioning is rated in six domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on a five-point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment. The CDR-SOB (Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes) is based on summing each of the domain box scores with total scores ranging from 0-18, where lower total scores represent better outcomes and higher total scores represent worse outcomes.</description>

        <description>FCSRT assesses verbal episodic memory. Performances in free recalls, cued recalls and in a recognition task were analyzed, as the process of encoding is controlled. Participants were asked to remember a list of 16 words. Three tasks of free and cued recalls, as well as 1 recognition task and one delayed recall give the scores. Total recall was obtained by the addition of cued recalls to free recalls. Maximum score is 48 for immediate: 16 words multiplied by (*) 3 corresponding to immediate free recall + immediate cued recall + immediate recognition test. Maximum score is 64 (better score) when delayed recall: 16 words*4. The minimum score is 0 (worse).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) Score at Week 156 (OLE Phase)</title>
        <description>The MMSE is a brief, practical screening test for cognitive dysfunction. The test consists of five sections (orientation, registration, attention-calculation, recall, and language); the total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function. A positive change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>Participants were considered positive or negative for ADA based on their baseline and post-baseline sample results. The number and percentage of participants with confirmed positive ADA levels were determined. The prevalence of ADA at baseline was calculated as the proportion of participants with confirmed positive ADA levels at baseline relative to the total number of participants with a sample available at baseline. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs was determined as the proportion of participants with confirmed post-baseline positive ADAs relative to the total number of participants that had at least one post-baseline sample available for ADA analysis.</description>
