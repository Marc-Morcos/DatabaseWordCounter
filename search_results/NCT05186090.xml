      AGUEDA (Active Gains in brain using Exercise During Aging) is a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      designed to examine the effects of a 24-week resistance exercise program on brain health in&#xD;
      cognitively normal adults between 65-80 years of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has emerged as the most promising non-pharmacologic intervention for improving brain&#xD;
      health in older adults. The main aim of AGUEDA (Active Gains in brain using Exercise During&#xD;
      Aging) trial is to examine the effects of a 6-month resistance exercise program on executive&#xD;
      function in cognitively normal older adults. The secondary aims are (i) to examine the&#xD;
      effects of exercise on central and peripheral brain markers, and (ii) to investigate&#xD;
      mediators and moderators of the exercise-derived improvements observed in executive function&#xD;
      and brain markers. AGUEDA is a randomized controlled trial in which 90 cognitively normal&#xD;
      older adults, aged 65-80 years old, will be randomized into an exercise group (n=45) or a&#xD;
      wait-list control group (n=45). Participants assigned to the exercise group will participate&#xD;
      in a 24-week resistance exercise program (3 sessions/week, 60 min/session), while the control&#xD;
      group will be asked to maintain their usual lifestyle. A comprehensive neuropsychological&#xD;
      test battery, amyloid PET scan, cutting-edge MRI scan, DXA scan, physical ﬁtness, physical&#xD;
      function and physical activity measures will be used. Blood, saliva and fecal samples will be&#xD;
      collected. Mental health and psychosocial variables will be self-reported.&#xD;

    <description>This group will perform a 24-week resistance exercise program. Participants will engage in 180 minutes/week of resistance exercise (3 supervised sessions peer week, 60 min/session). The training will consist of a combination of upper and lower body exercises using elastic bands and participants' body weight as the primary resistance. Exercise load and intensity will be based on the number of repetitions (i.e.,10-12 repetitions), resistance of the elastic bands, in ascending order with seven intensities, and also on the exercises' difficulty (i.e., three levels). The prescribed targeted intensity will reach 70-80% of the participants' maximum rating perceived exertion (i.e., 7-8 RPE).The progression (horizontal) will be standardized according to the execution time and RPE, and individualized according to execution speed and band resistance. Heart rate will be monitored in all sessions. Further, intrinsic motivation before and after session and sleep quality will be registered.</description>
