  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, cross-over study to measure global and clinical impact and level of&#xD;
      arousal in subjects suffering from moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease when exposed to&#xD;
      emotionally impactful music compared to control intervention. In partnership with the study&#xD;
      partner (a person who spends 10 hours or more a week with the subject and can reliably report&#xD;
      on the subject's condition), three tunes will be chosen for the purposes of the study. The&#xD;
      tunes chosen will need to be related to a past meaningful, positive experience of the&#xD;
      subject, as determined by the subject and the subject's study partner. The pieces will be&#xD;
      restricted in duration to between 1.5 and 2 minutes each. A piece will be chosen at random&#xD;
      and will be saved on a portable device, and subjects will be asked to listen to the melody&#xD;
      using high quality, over-ear headphones. The total exposure time will be 10 minutes each hour&#xD;
      over a three-hour period. The melody will be repeated as many times as necessary to complete&#xD;
      the 10-minute period. The control intervention will involve listening to nature sounds at the&#xD;
      same duration and administration scheme. Functional magnetic resonance imaging will be used&#xD;
      to identify how brain networks are modulated via exposure to this music and how they&#xD;
      associate with the clinical findings.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>This study will be part of the Alzheimer's Clinical Trials Consortium (ACTC). The study abides by the principles for sharing of research data as described in the NIH Public Access Policy on data sharing. The researchers endorse the sharing of final de-identified research data to serve important scientific goals. This project will facilitate sharing of software, archived study datasets (including images), assessment instruments, forms, and procedures through the web-based tools of the ACTC. The ACTC web portal will include access to inventories of resources and request procedures. All ACTC archival datasets will be included on the Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network (GAAIN); ACTC data can be accessed via the GAAIN platform; full or partial archived datasets can be shared via the dedicated ACTC Dataset- Sharing Portal.</ipd_description>
