  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a randomized controlled trial design to evaluate the effect of two&#xD;
      evidence-based treatments for adults with mild Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). The aim of&#xD;
      the study is to help us better understand the effects of speech language therapy on&#xD;
      communication abilities in individuals with PPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be&#xD;
      involved in the study for 12 months. Each participant will receive a laptop equipped with the&#xD;
      necessary applications and features for the study. Participants will receive 5 evaluations&#xD;
      and 15 speech therapy sessions with a licensed speech therapist, as well as access to&#xD;
      Communication Bridge, a personalized web application to practice home exercises that&#xD;
      reinforce treatment strategies. There are no costs to participate in this study.&#xD;

    <description>Participants receive Communication Bridge™, a multi-component, participation-focused, dyadic intervention in which both the person with PPA and their co-enrolled communication partner are intervention recipients. Communication Bridge™ is modelled on the Living with Aphasia: Framework for Outcome Measurement (A-FROM) and the Care Pathway Model that was developed for persons living with primary progressive aphasia. Consistent with participation-focused intervention models personally salient training stimuli are incorporated into all therapy activities in the Experimental arm.</description>

    <description>The Control arm includes a non-dyadic intervention in which the person with PPA is the active intervention recipient and their communication partner is in a supporting role. In the Control arm, participants receive a speech-language intervention designed to address impairment and functional limitations, comprised of activities that address word retrieval and 'automatic' speech production using fixed, non-personalized, stimuli across participants.</description>
