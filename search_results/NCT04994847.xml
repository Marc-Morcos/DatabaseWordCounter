      The purpose of this study is to track changes in the brain related to Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
      The results from this study will be used to develop new approaches to prevent or delay the&#xD;
      onset of memory and thinking problems associated with Alzheimer's.&#xD;

      This study aims to establish, use, and extensively share a comprehensive longitudinal&#xD;
      resource of genetic, non-genetic, and cognitive data, brain imaging and fluid biomarker&#xD;
      measurements of amyloid-Î², tau pathophysiology, neurodegeneration, and inflammation and&#xD;
      biological samples to advance the study of cognitively unimpaired older adults at six levels&#xD;
      of genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease due to their APOE genotype including understudied&#xD;
      APOE2 and APOE4 homozygotes (HMs) at the lowest and highest risk and those APOE4 HMs and&#xD;
      heterozygotes (HTs) who remain unimpaired at older ages due to unknown protective factors and&#xD;
      spared pathophysiological effects despite their genetic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will provide blood samples for clinical lab analysis, DNA, RNA, plasma,&#xD;
      serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) every 12 months; amyloid and tau PET&#xD;
      scans, a nearly one hour battery of MRIs, a lumbar puncture (LP) for the collection of CSF&#xD;
      samples, and a comprehensive battery of cognitive, behavioral, risk factor, and other&#xD;
      assessments every 24 months. Extracted DNA will be used to characterize the participant's&#xD;
      APOE genotype, screen for rare APOE variants that might make them eligible for other studies,&#xD;
      and perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) and genome-wide genotyping.&#xD;

        For the Arizona APOE Cohort, we will establish a new longitudinal cohort of 300 cognitively&#xD;
        unimpaired males and non-pregnant females, 50-90 years of age at the time of enrollment who&#xD;
        will be enrolled based on their APOE genotype, age, other eligibility criteria, consent to&#xD;
        participate in virtually all study procedures, and consent to provide a shared resource of&#xD;
        anonymized data and biological samples for the research community. Participants will&#xD;
        include 50 individuals with each of the six common APOE genotypes (known as 2/2, 2/3, 3/3,&#xD;
        2/4, 3/4, and 4/4) who are matched by age decile, sex, and educational level. Participants&#xD;
        will not receive information about their APOE genotype from this project97 and will be&#xD;
        studied under the auspicious of a single Institutional Review Board (IRB).&#xD;
