  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In clinical trials of preclinical pharmacodynamic studies, Flos Gossypii Flavonoids Tablet&#xD;
      has been proved to significantly improve the learning and memory ability of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease model. Phase I clinical tolerance test is to observe the human body's tolerance to&#xD;
      Flos Gossypii Flavonoids Tablet, and provide a basis for the formulation of safe and&#xD;
      reasonable dosing regimens for phase II clinical trials. Therefore, a Phase II clinical trial&#xD;
      is now being conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of the Flos Gossypii Flavonoids&#xD;
      Tablet in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (marinus sea deficiency/brain&#xD;
      collateral stasis syndrome). In this study, the researchers will use a multicenter,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel method to recruit AD patients to&#xD;
      confirm the efficacy and safety of Flos Gossypii Flavonoids Tablet. Confirmation of drug&#xD;
      efficacy will be observed through changes in AD patients' general cognitive and different&#xD;
      cognitive domain functions, daily living activities, and symptom severities.&#xD;

      Cotton flower is a Xinjiang Uygur ethnic medicine, and its main active ingredients are&#xD;
      flavonoids. Studies have proved that flavonoids have strong characteristics of antioxidant&#xD;
      stress and anti-inflammatory response. Preclinical pharmacodynamic studies on rats showed&#xD;
      that the Flos Gossypii Flavonoids Tablet could significantly improve the learning and memory&#xD;
      ability of AD model caused by different factors, and the mechanism may be related to its&#xD;
      inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory response. A total of 57 subjects were&#xD;
      enrolled in the Phase I tolerance clinical study. The results showed that the experimental&#xD;
      drug may temporarily increase the three indexes of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase,&#xD;
      creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, which can self-recovery in a short time. Combined&#xD;
      with the safety evaluation results of phase I clinical trial, Flos Gossypii Flavonoids Tablet&#xD;
      is a drug with high safety.&#xD;

    <description>Differences between the low-dose and high-dose groups in changes in ADAS cog/11 scores (relative to baseline) at weeks 13 and 26 were compared with the placebo group.&#xD;
The ADAS-cog assesses cognitive function in seven components: word recall, instruction, structural practice, naming, conceptual practice, orientation, and word recognition. The total score ranges from 0 to 70, with lower scores representing milder disease.</description>

    <description>Differences in changes in 12-item behavioral domain scores (relative to baseline) on the NPI scale at weeks 13 and 26 between the low-dose and high-dose groups compared with placebo.&#xD;
The NPI scale is an interview conducted by the research doctor based on the patient's caregiver to ask the patient's mental and emotional changes. The questions included 12 items including delusions, hallucinations, depression, and anxiety, each of which identified the severity, frequency, and psychological stress of the caregiver.</description>
