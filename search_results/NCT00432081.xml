  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine whether indomethacin is able to retard disease&#xD;
      progression in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research indicates that inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may retard the progression of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison(s): Cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate AD receiving the NSAID&#xD;
      indomethacin, compared to cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate AD receiving&#xD;
      placebo, during a one-year period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient will satisfy the DSM-IV criteria for dementia of the Alzheimer's type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient will satisfy the NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for the clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
             probable Alzheimer's disease (Appendix I).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The severity of dementia for each patient will be quantified by a Mini-Mental State&#xD;
             Examination (MMSE) score between 10 and 26 (both inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is living at home or in a home for the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a responsible caregiver who is able to provide information about the&#xD;
             patient's functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent is obtained from the patient or the legally accepted&#xD;
             representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient satisfies the NINDS-AIREN criteria for probable vascular dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A known exaggerated pharmacological sensitivity or allergy to NSAID's.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of peptic ulceration, gastric surgery or gastrointestinal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current diagnosis of active peptic ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current diagnosis of severe and unstable cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current diagnosis of renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced, severe and unstable disease of any type, other than Alzheimer's disease,&#xD;
             that may interfere with primary and secondary variable evaluations, including a&#xD;
             medical condition which should be expected to progress, recur, or change to such an&#xD;
             extent that it may bias the assessment of the clinical or mental status of the patient&#xD;
             to a significant degree or put the patient at special risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intake of any of the following concomitant medications: salicylates, coumarin&#xD;
             derivatives, ACE-inhibitors, loop diuretics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intake of any of the following concomitant medications more than two months&#xD;
             immediately prior or during the study: NSAID's, systemic corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intake of any of the following concomitant medications with a possible effect on&#xD;
             cognition: estrogen, deprenyl, vitamin E, neuroleptics, anticholinergics. Patients&#xD;
             using stable doses of cholinesterase inhibitors were eligible, with the provision that&#xD;
             the dose should not be changed during the study. Cholinesterase inhibitors could not&#xD;
             be initiated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Excessive use of alcohol (more than 5 units per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is, either alone or with the aid of a caregiver, not able to reliably take&#xD;
             the medication.&#xD;
