                  questions, follow instructions, and complete questionnaires and detailed&#xD;
                  neuropsychological test.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have results of clinical laboratory tests/physical examination, vital signs, and&#xD;
                  ECG within normal limits (at 90 days prior to [18F]PI-2620 positron emission&#xD;
                  computed tomography) or clinically acceptable to the investigator at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If female, not be of childbearing potential as indicated by one of the following&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Each subject (or legal representative) must sign the informed consent form in&#xD;
                  accordance with local requirements after the scope and nature of the&#xD;
                  investigation have been explained to them, and before screening assessments.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  The patient has contraindications to undergo positron emission computed&#xD;
                  tomography or MRI, which include but are not restricted to the examples below:&#xD;
                  claustrophobia, cardiac pacemaker, metal devices around the eye or spinal cord,&#xD;
                  cochlear implant, etc.) at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient has been treated with any investigational medicinal product (IMP)&#xD;
                  within 30 days prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
