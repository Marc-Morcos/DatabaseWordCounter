  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 35,000 people each year in the UK have a type of stroke, called 'lacunar' or 'small&#xD;
      vessel' stroke, which is different to other common types of stroke and for which there is no&#xD;
      proven treatment. It is thought that small vessel stroke is caused by damage to the lining of&#xD;
      the tiny blood vessels deep inside the brain that stops them functioning normally. This not&#xD;
      only causes stroke but, perhaps more importantly, causes problems with thinking and walking,&#xD;
      possibly causing up to 45% of all dementias either on its own, or mixed with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (about 350,000 patients in the UK). Some drugs that are commonly used in other blood&#xD;
      vessel diseases may help improve small vessel function and prevent worsening of brain damage.&#xD;
      One drug (cilostazol) has been tested in patients with stroke in the Asia Pacific countries&#xD;
      but not on dementia; the other drug (isosorbide mononitrate) is widely used in the UK for&#xD;
      heart disease but not stroke. The investigators want to set up a clinical trial to test if&#xD;
      the study methods are practical so that patients and trial centres can follow the procedures,&#xD;
      and to confirm how many patients have more stroke-like symptoms or experience worsening of&#xD;
      their thinking skills. This information is needed to be sure that a very large clinical trial&#xD;
      to find out if these drugs can prevent worsening of small vessel disease will be possible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A quarter of all ischaemic strokes (about 35000 per annum in the UK) are lacunar (small&#xD;
      vessel) in type, mainly caused by an intrinsic, non-atheromatous, non-cardioembolic disease&#xD;
      of the small deep perforating cerebral arterioles. More diffuse cerebral small vessel disease&#xD;
      also causes up to 45% of dementias (350,000+ patients estimated currently in the UK), either&#xD;
      alone or in association with Alzheimer's disease. There is no proven treatment for cerebral&#xD;
      small vessel disease: conventional antiplatelet drugs may be ineffective or even hazardous,&#xD;
      whilst antihypertensive treatment and statins may not have an effect. The disease mechanism&#xD;
      is poorly understood but endothelial dysfunction, blood-brain barrier failure and vessel&#xD;
      stiffness appear to contribute to the pathogenesis. Promising data available for licensed&#xD;
      drugs with relevant modes of action, cilostazol (&gt;6000 stroke patients in the Asia Pacific&#xD;
      Region) and isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN, widely used in cardiac disease) support their&#xD;
      testing in cerebral small vessel disease. This trial will be an Phase IIb preparatory to&#xD;
      Phase III, randomised, partial factorial, open label, blinded end-point trial, testing&#xD;
      cilostazol, ISMN, both, or neither, to assess the feasibility of recruitment, drug&#xD;
      tolerability, trial procedures, safety and event rates in 400 patients recruited in UK stroke&#xD;
      centres and followed-up to one year (primary endpoint). This trial is preparatory to a large,&#xD;
      definitive, Phase III randomised controlled trial to prevent recurrent lacunar stroke and&#xD;
      progressive small vessel disease-related physical and cognitive impairments after lacunar&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical lacunar stroke syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain scanning* with MR including diffusion imaging wherever possible, and obtained&#xD;
             soon after the presentation with stroke, shows either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a recent, relevant (in time and location) acute lacunar infarct on diffusion MR&#xD;
                  imaging1,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  or, if no visible acute lacunar infarct on diffusion MR imaging2 then there is no&#xD;
                  competing pathology as a cause for stroke (e.g. no acute cortical infarct, no&#xD;
                  acute intra-cerebral haemorrhage, no stroke mimic such as tumour, subdural&#xD;
                  haematoma);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  or, if only a CT brain scan is available2 as in section 3 above, then there is a&#xD;
                  small relevant (in age and location) subcortical infarct, or if no infarct then&#xD;
                  there is no competing pathology as a cause for stroke (e.g. no acute cortical&#xD;
                  infarct, no acute intra-cerebral haemorrhage, no stroke mimic such as tumour,&#xD;
                  subdural haematoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Note that if there is no acute lacunar infarct on MR diffusion imaging but&#xD;
                       there is a recent-appearing lacunar infarct on FLAIR, T2, or T1 (i.e. no&#xD;
                       cavitation or ex-vacuo effect; may be slightly swollen, ill-defined edges;&#xD;
                       or scan in the few weeks before the stroke does not show a lesion but there&#xD;
                       is an acute lacunar infarct on MR T2, FLAIR, T1 scanning after the stroke in&#xD;
                       an appropriate area of the brain for symptoms), then the T2, FLAIR, T1&#xD;
                       lesion may be counted as the acute lacunar infarct in the absence of a&#xD;
                       diffusion lesion. Similarly, on CT2 a recent relevant small subcortical&#xD;
                       infarct would not show cavitation or shrinkage/ex vacuo effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Note that about a third of patients with a clinically definite lacunar&#xD;
                       syndrome do not have a corresponding recent infarct visible on MRI but&#xD;
                       should still be classed as 'lacunar stroke' if no other explanation can be&#xD;
                       found for the symptoms. The presence of a recent cortical infarct on FLAIR,&#xD;
                       T2, T1, the recent timing being indicated by the characteristics above,&#xD;
                       would count as a competing pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note that the complete absence of any abnormality on MR or CT brain imaging (no acute&#xD;
        subcortical infarct or pre-existing SVD such as white matter hyperintensities, lacunes,&#xD;
        etc.) while occasionally seen in lacunar stroke is unusual and should question the&#xD;
        diagnosis of lacunar ischaemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 30 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Independent in activities of daily living (modified Rankin ≤2)&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other significant active neurological illness present since suffering stroke (e.g.&#xD;
             recurrent seizures, multiple sclerosis, brain tumour). Well-controlled epilepsy&#xD;
             present prior to the stroke, a single seizure at onset of the stroke or provoked&#xD;
             seizure is not an exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requiring assistance with activities of daily living (Modified Rankin ≥3)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has been diagnosed as having dementia on formal clinical assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active cardiac disease (atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction in past 6 months,&#xD;
             active angina, symptomatic cardiac failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of hypotension, defined as sitting systolic blood pressure less than 100mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Definite indication for (i.e. already prescribed) either trial medication, or definite&#xD;
             contraindication to a trial drug as per SPCs - lactose intolerance is a&#xD;
             contraindication to ISMN preparations which contain lactose monohydrate - (indication&#xD;
             for or contraindication to one of the trial drugs still allows randomisation to the&#xD;
             other trial drug)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bleeding tendency (e.g. known platelets&lt;100, active peptic ulcer, history of&#xD;
             intracranial haemorrhage such as subdural haematoma, subarachnoid haemorrhage,&#xD;
             intracerebral haemorrhage, but not asymptomatic haemorrhagic transformation of&#xD;
             infarction or a few microbleeds, taking anticoagulant medication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned surgery during the trial period including carotid endarterectomy. Note prior&#xD;
             and apparently successful carotid endarterectomy (or other surgery) is not an&#xD;
             exclusion criterion and patients who would otherwise be eligible but require&#xD;
             endarterectomy first may be randomised after recovery from successful endarterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other concurrent life threatening illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unlikely to be available for follow-up (e.g. moving outside or visitor to the area)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, women of childbearing age not taking contraception.&#xD;
             Acceptable contraception in women of childbearing age is a &quot;highly effective&quot;&#xD;
             contraceptive measure as defined by the Clinical Trials Facilitation Group&#xD;
             (http://www.hma.eu/fileadmin/dateien/Human_Medicines/01-About_HMA/Working_Groups/CTFG/&#xD;
             2014_09_HMA_CTFG_Contraception.pdf) and includes combined (oestrogen and progesterone&#xD;
             containing) or progesterone-only contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
             ovulation, or intrauterine device or bilateral tubal occlusion. Contraception must be&#xD;
             continued for up to 30 days after the end of the IMP dosing schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prohibited medications to either trial drug (see sections 4.5 of the appended SPCs and&#xD;
             protocol section 6.6.3, plus no anticoagulant drugs); (prohibited medications to one&#xD;
             of the trial drugs still allows randomisation to the other trial drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;25 ml/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic impairment&#xD;
