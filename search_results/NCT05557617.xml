      The study is designed to inquire whether the presence of periodontitis and different&#xD;
      periodontopathogenic bacterial strains are associated with dementia diagnosis and with the&#xD;
      degree of cognitive impairment in patients evaluated at a Memory clinic (Minnesmottagning).&#xD;
      Specifically, by analyzing CSF samples, we intend to clarify whether the alleged mechanisms&#xD;
      for P. gingivalis in the aetiology of AD are supported in a Swedish population and whether&#xD;
      they are specific for P. gingivalis (as compared to other periodontopathogenic bacteria) and&#xD;
      Alzheimer type dementia (as compared to other etiological dementia types), respectively.&#xD;

      Purpose and aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to inquire whether the presence of periodontitis and different&#xD;
      periodontopathogenic bacterial strains are associated with dementia diagnosis and with the&#xD;
      degree of cognitive impairment in patients evaluated at a Memory clinic (Minnesmottagning).&#xD;
      Specifically, by analyzing CSF samples, we intend to clarify whether the alleged mechanisms&#xD;
      for P. gingivalis in the aetiology of AD are supported in a Swedish population and whether&#xD;
      they are specific for P. gingivalis (as compared to other periodontopathogenic bacteria) and&#xD;
      Alzheimer type dementia (as compared to other etiological dementia types), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      In what proportion of Swedish dementia patients is bacterial DNA from periodontal pathogens,&#xD;
      antibodies against periodontal pathogens, gingipain protein from P. gingivalis and gingipain&#xD;
      enzyme activity found in CSF? Are these bacteriological findings in the CSF more common or&#xD;
      more elevated in patients that received a diagnosis of dementia, as compared to patients with&#xD;
      a lower level of cognitive dysfunction (e.g. mild cognitive impairment, subjective cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, or no diagnosis)? Are measurements of cognitive function, e.g. mini-mental state&#xD;
      examination (MMSE) scores, correlated with bacteriological findings in the CSF, including&#xD;
      gingipain activity? Is the prevalence of periodontitis higher in patients that received a&#xD;
      diagnosis of dementia, as compared to patients with a lower level of cognitive dysfunction?&#xD;
      Was the prevalence of periodontitis, 5 - 15 years prior to the diagnostic evaluation, higher&#xD;
      in patients that received a diagnosis of dementia, as compared to patients with a lower level&#xD;
      of cognitive dysfunction? Are measurements of cognitive function, e.g. mini-mental state&#xD;
      examination (MMSE) scores, correlated with periodontitis-related findings? In that case, does&#xD;
      the correlation depend on the time interval between the periodontal and the cognitive&#xD;
      assessments? Are the above bacteriological findings in the CSF more common or more elevated&#xD;
      in patients with severe periodontitis, as compared to patients with mild or no periodontitis?&#xD;
      Are periodontitis-related findings correlated with bacteriological findings in the CSF,&#xD;
      including gingipain activity? In that case, does the correlation depend on the time interval&#xD;
      between the periodontal assessments and the CSF sample? Are P. gingivalis-related findings&#xD;
      more common or more pronounced than findings related to other periodontal pathogens in any of&#xD;
      these potential relationships? Are P. gingivalis-related findings and other bacteriological&#xD;
      findings in the CSF more common or more elevated in patients with AD, as compared to patients&#xD;
      with non-Alzheimer dementias? Are P. gingivalis-related findings and other bacteriological&#xD;
      findings in the CSF correlated with AD-markers in the CSF, such as β-amyloid, tau and&#xD;
      phospho-tau?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is based on a cohort of patients that has been investigated for assumed cognitive&#xD;
      impairment at the Memory Clinic (Minnesmottagningen), Department of Geriatric Medicine,&#xD;
      Örebro University Hospital. The clinical examination includes cognitive tests, brain imaging,&#xD;
      etc. A diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment may be given, but other cases will&#xD;
      not receive any of these diagnoses. As a part of these investigations, a lumbar puncture is&#xD;
      usually performed to analyze AD-markers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Approximately 200&#xD;
      lumbar punctures are performed annually, and an aliquot of each sample (1 - 2 mL) is&#xD;
      routinely stored in a biobank for 5 years or longer. To our knowledge, at least 300 samples&#xD;
      are stored. A retrospective analysis of these CSF samples will form the basis for our&#xD;
      biochemical investigations. From these approximately 300 patients we will select 120 patients&#xD;
      to include in our study. Those that received a diagnosis of dementia will be the case group,&#xD;
      those that did not fulfil dementia criteria (around 25 %) will serve as a control group. We&#xD;
      will include patients with the most complete available clinical data until we reach 120&#xD;
      inclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive function and existing CSF data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical records from Minnesmottagningen include results from cognitive tests, e.g. MMSE,&#xD;
      Clock Drawing Test, Trail Making Tests, etc. These will be retrieved and registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnoses given at Minnesmottagningen, i.e. dementia (if available, also the etiological&#xD;
      type of dementia), minor cognitive impairment, other or no diagnosis, will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The documented results of CSF-analyses of AD-markers, such as β-amyloid, tau and phospho-tau&#xD;
      will be retrieved and registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and periodontitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the patients' medical records, information on known risk factors for AD and&#xD;
      periodontitis will be collected, notably hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, coronary heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental records, including radiographs from the patients' dentists up to 15 years back will be&#xD;
      searched for and reviewed. Periodontal status will be assessed by research dentists based on&#xD;
      radiographs and clinical examinations extracted from the study participants' dental records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSF analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      These analyses are viewed as explorative. Therefore, we plan interim evaluations after the&#xD;
      first 30 results (for each analysis), to estimate the feasibility of continued analysis. Some&#xD;
      of the analyses will be performed at laboratories available to the research group, other&#xD;
      analyses will be sent to established research laboratories. Analyses will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial DNA from selected species by PCR. Gingipain analyses with ELISA and with a specific&#xD;
      sensor. Antibodies against selected bacteria with ELISA. Cytokines, chemokines and growth&#xD;
      factors with ELISA / Multiplex. The study is planned to include e.g Aggregatibacter&#xD;
      actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola, however, focusing on P.&#xD;
      gingivalis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power analysis can be based on data from Dominy et al. 2019. In CSF from 10 patients with&#xD;
      AD, P. gingivalis DNA was detected in seven, but no control CSFs were included. However, in&#xD;
      their post-mortem brain parenchyma analyses, P. gingivalis toxins were present in 91-96 % of&#xD;
      AD brains and 39-52 % of control brains. We may envisage 70 % positive CSF findings in our&#xD;
      dementia patients versus 30 % in our controls based on this. For 80 % statistical power and α&#xD;
      set at 0.05, we would need a minimum sample size of 61 patients. Due to the explorative&#xD;
      nature of our study and a number of uncertainties concerning these calculations, we want to&#xD;
      include 120 patients in the study, with an interim evaluation of the CSF analyses after 30&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyzes will be carried out in the computer program SPSS and will include&#xD;
      established standard analyzes, e.g. T-tests, Mann-Whitney tests, Pearson and Spearman&#xD;
      correlations, logistic and multivariate regressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and scientific novelty&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from this study could provide support for the theory that periodontitis and&#xD;
      specific bacteria, implicated in the development of periodontitis, are involved in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis and development of dementia. Clarifying the disease mechanisms of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease and other types of dementia is an important step toward finding more efficient&#xD;
      strategies to prevent and treat these diseases in the future.&#xD;
