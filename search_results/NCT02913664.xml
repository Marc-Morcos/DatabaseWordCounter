  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity, high blood pressure and dyslipidemia are risk factors for Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD) and vascular dementia. Importantly, these risk factors are modifiable with&#xD;
      lifestyle changes, pharmacological treatment, or both. The rrAD study will determine effects&#xD;
      of aerobic exercise training and intensive vascular risk reduction on cognitive performance&#xD;
      in older adults who have high risk for AD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous lines of evidence suggest that interventions that confer therapeutic benefits for&#xD;
      cardiovascular health are also associated with improvements in, or preservation of, cognitive&#xD;
      function. Many believe &quot;What's good for the heart is good for the brain.&quot; However, stronge&#xD;
      scientific evidence is needed to prove this hypothesis. The rrAD study is a 4-arm,&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized trial to assess the effects of aerobic exercise training and&#xD;
      intensive pharmacological reduction of vascular risk factors on cognitive performance in&#xD;
      older adults who have high risk for AD, that is, those who have high blood pressure, family&#xD;
      history of dementia or subjective memory complaints. Furthermore, rrAD will examine effects&#xD;
      of exercise and vascular risk reduction on brain volume, perfusion, and neural network&#xD;
      connectivity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
