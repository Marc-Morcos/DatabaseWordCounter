  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human fibroblasts and possibly other human somatic cells may be reprogrammed into induced&#xD;
      pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by the forced expression of transcription factors (1-5). The iPS&#xD;
      cells seem to share many properties with human embryonic stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induced pluripotent stem cells potentially may be useful in the future as an unlimited source&#xD;
      of cells for transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major goal of the project is to develop human iPS cells from cell cultures from skin&#xD;
      biopsies or the patient's hair. The iPS cells will be developed primarily for modeling&#xD;
      diseases and drug discovery as well as basic research, and for developing the technology that&#xD;
      may eventually allow the use of iPS cells for future transplantation therapy. The iPS cells&#xD;
      developed in the course of this application are not intended for use in transplantation&#xD;
      therapy. Future development of iPS cells for clinical transplantation therapies will be&#xD;
      subjected to the appropriate authorization by ethical and regulatory committees.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The derivation of human iPS cells (1-5) open new avenues to model human diseases since it may&#xD;
      now be possible to develop iPS cells from the fibroblasts or other somatic cells of patients&#xD;
      with various conditions. These iPS cells may be directed to differentiate into the cells&#xD;
      which are affected in specific conditions. Abnormalities in the development of the affected&#xD;
      cells as well as altered survival or function of the cells may be studied. Thus iPS cells may&#xD;
      serve as an invaluable model for the study of the pathogenesis of human diseases and may also&#xD;
      serve for the development of new drugs, and high throughput screening of molecules for toxic&#xD;
      or therapeutic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the great potential of iPS cells for disease modelling and transplantation&#xD;
      therapy, the cells may have broad applications in basic research in various areas such as&#xD;
      reprogramming, basic development and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, it is still unclear whether the properties of iPS cells are identical to those of&#xD;
      hESCs. Initial data suggest that human iPS cells are indeed similar to hESCs in their&#xD;
      phenotype, epigenetic status of pluripotent self-specific genes, telomerase activity, gene&#xD;
      expression profile and in their capability to differentiate into progeny of the three germ&#xD;
      layers both in vitro and in vivo in teratomas (2, 3, 5). In the mouse system, directed&#xD;
      differentiation of iPS cells into bone marrow repopulating hematopoietic stem cells and&#xD;
      functional dopaminergic neurons was demonstrated (6, 7). However, incomplete silencing of the&#xD;
      constitutive expression of the transcription factors that were used to induce reprogramming&#xD;
      can probably interfere with differentiation (1). Further studies are required to confirm that&#xD;
      the developmental potential and biological properties of iPS cells are identical to hESC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, retroviral vectors are most commonly used to introduce and express the transgenes&#xD;
      which reprogram the somatic nucleus (1-5). The use of retroviral vectors, which integrate&#xD;
      into the host cell genome, may cause hazardous insertion mutagenesis. Moreover, the use of&#xD;
      potentially oncogenic transcription factors, such as c-Myc, significantly limits the clinical&#xD;
      use of human iPS cells for future cell therapy. However, successful derivation of iPS cells&#xD;
      was demonstrated without the forced expression of c-Myc. The decreased efficiency of&#xD;
      reprogramming, in the absence of overexpressed c-Myc, may be improved by molecules which act&#xD;
      via epigenetic mechanisms. Moreover, successful derivation of iPS cells was recently reported&#xD;
      with the use of non-integrating adeno viral vectors or repeated transfections. Thus it&#xD;
      appears that with further developments, it may be possible in the future to safely induce&#xD;
      pluripotent cells from somatic cells for therapeutic applications.&#xD;
