      disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of neurodegenerative&#xD;
      dementia. In its early stages, the differential diagnosis of DLB and Alzheimer's disease (AD)&#xD;
      can be challenging. The differential diagnosis is particularly important given that patients&#xD;
      with DLB respond well to cholinesterase inhibitors but show sensitivity to neuroleptic&#xD;
      medications which are contraindicated in DLB. DLB tends to progress more quickly than&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. Diagnostic accuracy may be improved. Oculomotor recording, easy to&#xD;
      perform could be helpful in order to identify and reliably assess fluctuating attention&#xD;
      performance in DLB patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - to improve differential diagnosis between DLB and AD in the early stages of the disease&#xD;
      with oculomotor measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to examine the association between the oculomotor records and neuropsychological&#xD;
           examination assessing attention abilities and their fluctuations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the benefit of complementary neuropsychological tests in the distinction&#xD;
           between DLB and AD cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to examine the relationship between hippocampal volume and neuropsychological&#xD;
           examination in DLB cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to examine the diagnostic performance of MRI (Support Vector Machine) between DLB and AD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to examine the interest of CSF alpha synuclein concentration to discriminate DLB from AD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess at one year variations in oculomotor test scores and neuropsychological test&#xD;
           scores Method and design Longitudinal multicenter study including 100 patients with a&#xD;
           DLB or AD diagnosis. Clinical examination at one year.&#xD;
