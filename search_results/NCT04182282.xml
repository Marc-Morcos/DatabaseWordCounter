      This research study will evaluate the CARES Dementia-Friendly Hospitals online training and&#xD;
      certification program for Allied Health Workers (nursing assistants, dietary aides,&#xD;
      housekeeping employees, hospital transporters, lab/x-ray techs, and unit secretaries) who&#xD;
      work in a hospital or medical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who sign up for this study will complete two 1-hour assessments (on day 1 and&#xD;
      day 45). Participants will be randomly assigned into either an &quot;immediate group&quot; (where&#xD;
      Participants complete the online training as part of the research study) or a &quot;control group&quot;&#xD;
      (where Participants receive access to the online training at the end of the study). The&#xD;
      online training and certification will take Participants approximately 6 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To participate, Participants must be an allied health worker working at a hospital or medical&#xD;
      center, have access to a computer/tablet/smart phone with Internet access, be comfortable&#xD;
      reading and speaking in English, and age 21 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deadline to begin the study: January 31, 2020&#xD;

      Workers (nursing assistants, dietary aides, housekeeping employees, hospital transporters,&#xD;
      lab/x-ray techs, and unit secretaries) to enroll as research participants from a minimum of&#xD;
      12 hospitals in three different states.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Immediate training group participants will complete a consent form, an intake evaluation, and&#xD;
      have one month to complete the training. At day 45, they will complete an a follow-up&#xD;
      evaluation (identical to the intake evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group participants will complete a consent form and an intake evaluation. At day 45,&#xD;
      they will complete an a follow-up evaluation (identical to the intake evaluation). Once the&#xD;
      study is completed, each Control participant will be giving full access to the CARES&#xD;
      Dementia-Friendly Hospitals online training program (at no cost).&#xD;
&#xD;

      valid published scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIME TO COMPLETE THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take immediate participants approximately 8 hours to complete. The study will&#xD;
      take control participants approximately 2 hours to complete (each will be given voluntary&#xD;
      access to the 6-hour program at the end of the study, although this is not a study&#xD;
      requirement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL RISKS:&#xD;

      There are no anticipated associated risks to participants if they sign up for this study.&#xD;
      This is an educational program focusing on dementia-friendly hospital strategies.&#xD;
