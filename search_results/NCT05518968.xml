  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the pilot study is to assess the effects of an 8-week program on improving&#xD;
      mental health in depressed family caregivers of people with dementia. The program will&#xD;
      involve 8 weekly coach-guided videoconferencing sessions and the use of a web app based on&#xD;
      acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for 8 weeks. Also, the study aims to understand these&#xD;
      caregivers' experiences in the program, including their perspectives on the app features and&#xD;
      contents. We aim to recruit 8-10 people for this pilot project. Outcomes regarding&#xD;
      caregivers' mental health and ACT processes will be collected at pretest and posttest (after&#xD;
      the completion of the 8-week program) and compared over time (i.e., posttest scores compared&#xD;
      to pretest). At posttest, acceptability and perceived usability of the app will be evaluated&#xD;
      using the 10-item System Usability Scale and 30-40 minute individual interviews.&#xD;

      using the 10-item System Usability Scale and 30-40 minute individual interviews.&#xD;
      Participants' characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Either the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed-rank test (a non-parametric test) or the paired sample t-test (a parametric&#xD;
      test) will be performed to test the exploratory hypothesis that participants' scores for the&#xD;
      outcome measures would significantly improve at posttest compared to pretest. Because of the&#xD;
      exploratory nature of the study, no adjustment of p values will be conducted for multiple&#xD;
      statistical comparisons of the outcome measures. Statistical significance will be set at p&#xD;
      &lt;.05, and the effect sizes derived from this pilot study will form a basis for determining a&#xD;
      sample size with sufficient statistical power required for a subsequent clinical trial.&#xD;
      Caregivers' experiences in the app use and perspectives on the developed app will be explored&#xD;
      using individual Zoom interviews. Interpretative phenomenological analysis will be used to&#xD;
      analyze the interview data.&#xD;
