  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our central hypothesis is that the early metabolic lesions of MCI can be reliably detected in&#xD;
      individual subjects by objective analysis of [18]F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) brain images, earlier and more accurately than by subjective clinician&#xD;
      rating.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our goal with this proposal is a prospective, longitudinal study that will examine subjects&#xD;
      over a three-year span to establish the presence of MCI, evaluate progression of disease, and&#xD;
      determine the validity of this method in detecting early MCI. Specifically, we predict that&#xD;
      by using our Cognitive Decline Index (CDI) method of objective examination of FDG PET brain&#xD;
      images from patients diagnosed with MCI or mild AD, we can accurately discriminate very early&#xD;
      abnormalities in cerebral metabolism, and that this research method can be validated and&#xD;
      translated into a clinically useful tool for the early detection of MCI. Our long-range goals&#xD;
      are the development of methods and tools that enable the detection of pathology in individual&#xD;
      patients at risk for cognitive impairment.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        MCI Inclusion Criteria (patients):&#xD;
&#xD;
        MCI criteria met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Memory complaint, preferably corroborated by an informant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Objective memory impairment (based on cognitive test scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Normal general cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Intact ADL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Not demented.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 10 years of education, or GED, or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with ApoE4 positive homozygous or heterozygous status and/or&#xD;
                  first-degree relative with probable AD are preferred, but patients who meet all&#xD;
                  other criteria including well-defined MCI criteria will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age: 55-85&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have normal or clinically unimportant physical exam, beyond those consistent with&#xD;
                  a diagnosis of MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Able to give informed consent, or assent and informed consent from a legal&#xD;
                  representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Centrally acting medications will be closely tracked, patients on any such&#xD;
                  medications will be PET-scanned only after a 24-hour washout, with meds restarted&#xD;
                  immediately after the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because depression and depressive pseudodementia are often prodromal to cognitive&#xD;
                  decline, these diagnoses will not be exclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  MRI findings must be normal or unremarkable for the age of the patient. Examples&#xD;
                  of abnormal (exclusory) findings are occult lacunar infarct, arteriovenous&#xD;
                  malformation) Examples of non-exclusory findings include mild atrophy, mild to&#xD;
                  moderate periventricular white matter changes. Other MRI findings will be&#xD;
                  evaluated in consultation with coinvestigator neuroradiologists and clinical&#xD;
                  judgment will be used to determine if the subject can continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MCI Exclusion Criteria (patients):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other neuropsychiatric diagnoses (e.g., stroke, head trauma, any psychotic disorder,&#xD;
             Parkinson's) other than MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major medical illness (e.g., diabetes, severe or uncontrolled hypertension),&#xD;
             especially potential secondary causes of cognitive decline (e.g., hypothyroidism).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease, combination of disease, or presentation that, in the clinician's judgment,&#xD;
             could introduce intolerable variance into the PET brain scan image (example: coronary&#xD;
             artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, on 5 medications, HTN 2 yrs controlled with&#xD;
             meds, random glucose of 125, but no Dx of DM, Hx of ?TIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current substance or alcohol dependence or history of same, and no alcohol or&#xD;
             substance abuse within the last eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Inclusion criteria (patients):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. You must have a Mini Mental State Examination score of greater than 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. You must have one or more of these signs and symptoms of mild AD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cognitive impairment manifested as memory problems, problems with language, difficulty&#xD;
        carrying out motor activities, difficulty naming things, and/or problems planning or&#xD;
        organizing, all of which impair function and are worsening over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  You must have at least 10 years of education, or a GED, or its equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will be drawing blood to determine your ApoE genotype. ApoE4 is a risk factor for&#xD;
             Alzheimer's disease. We will share these results with you, if you desire to know the&#xD;
             results. ApoE4 is only a risk factor. That means it is possible to get Alzheimer's&#xD;
             without being ApoE4 positive, and it is possible to be ApoE4 positive and not get&#xD;
             Alzheimer's. If you are positive for the ApoE4 genetic marker, you can be included. If&#xD;
             you do NOT have the ApoE4 genetic marker, then you must have all other criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 55-85.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal or clinically unimportant physical exam, beyond those consistent with a&#xD;
             diagnosis of mild AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to give informed consent, or assent and informed consent from a legal&#xD;
             representative. You will be assessed for capacity and assent/consent obtained as&#xD;
             appropriate based on the Consensus Recommendations for Research Consent for&#xD;
             Cognitively Impaired Adults (2004, Alzheimer's Disease Association Disorder, 18&#xD;
             (3):171-175).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If you take medications that have an effect on the brain, they will be closely&#xD;
             monitored. You will be PET-scanned only after a 24-hour washout of this medication(s),&#xD;
             but this medication(s) will be restarted immediately after the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any problems related to the brain or mental disorders (e.g., stroke, head trauma, any&#xD;
             psychotic disorder, Parkinson's) other than mild AD. Some mood disorders will be&#xD;
             acceptable because depression is often a precursor to mild AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  You will get an MRI of your brain taken on the second visit, and a radiologist will&#xD;
             read it. If there are any abnormal findings, you will be told, and these findings will&#xD;
             be forwarded to your medical doctor. These findings may or may not result in your&#xD;
             exclusion from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any major medical illness (e.g., diabetes, severe or uncontrolled hypertension),&#xD;
             especially potential secondary causes of cognitive decline (e.g., hypothyroidism).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any disease, combination of disease, or presentation that, in the clinician's&#xD;
             judgment, could introduce intolerable variance into the PET brain scan image.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current diagnosis of substance or alcohol dependence or a history of same, and no&#xD;
             alcohol or substance abuse within the last eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MCI Inclusion criteria (controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal cognitive screening exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 55-85.&#xD;

          -  At least 10 years of education or GED, or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Socioeconomic status, age, and sex matched. Able to give informed consent, or assent&#xD;
             and informed consent from a legal representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Centrally acting medications will be closely tracked, patients on any such medications&#xD;
             will be PET-scanned only after a 24-hour washout, with meds restarted immediately&#xD;
             after the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MCI Exclusion criteria (controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First-degree relative with dementia or clinically relevant memory problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neuropsychiatric diagnoses (e.g., stroke, head trauma, depression, any psychoses).&#xD;

          -  Major medical illness (e.g., diabetes, severe /uncontrolled hypertension,&#xD;
             hypothyroidism).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current substance or alcohol dependence or history of same, and no alcohol or&#xD;
             substance abuse within the last eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI findings must be normal or unremarkable for the age of the patient. Examples of&#xD;
             abnormal (exclusory) findings are occult lacunar infarct, arteriovenous malformation)&#xD;
             Examples of non-exclusory findings include mild atrophy, mild to moderate&#xD;
             periventricular white matter changes. Other MRI findings will be evaluated in&#xD;
             consultation with coinvestigator neuroradiologists and clinical judgment will be used&#xD;
             to determine if the subject can continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Disease, combination of disease, or presentation that, in the clinician's&#xD;

          -  Adverse events intolerable to the patient that prevent continued involvement in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New onset medical disorder of such significance as to prohibit further involvement.&#xD;
