  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque buildup and phosphorylated&#xD;
      tau (p-tau) in the brain, as well as widespread neurodegeneration. Amyloid-β and tau are&#xD;
      proteins that build up in the brain that may contribute to memory problems. The evidence&#xD;
      suggests that both amyloid and tau play a critical role in AD and interventions that reliably&#xD;
      and safely decrease the intracerebral burden of amyloid or tau could potentially be of marked&#xD;
      clinical importance. Currently, therapeutic options are very limited and while there are&#xD;
      pharmacologic interventions that transiently improve cognitive function, there are no&#xD;
      treatments that alter disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if multiple daily sessions of non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation can affect brain activity to decrease the amount of amyloid and tau in people&#xD;
      with AD as compared to Sham (placebo) stimulation. The type of brain stimulation that will be&#xD;
      used is called transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). This study will&#xD;
      investigate different doses of tACS (2-4 weeks) and assess safety. The hope is that tACS will&#xD;
      decrease the amount of amyloid and tau and improve memory and thinking in people with AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, sham controlled, double-blind study in patients with early to&#xD;
      moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The study will enroll approximately 55 individuals with&#xD;
      amyloid positive Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or AD. Each subject will undergo a 1-2 visit&#xD;
      screening period consisting of a physical and neurological exam, medical history and&#xD;
      medication review, safety questionnaires, and cognitive testing. Each subject will then&#xD;
      undergo 5-7 baseline visits including neuropsychological testing (memory and thinking tests),&#xD;
      amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging if one is not available or it has been&#xD;
      greater than 6 months, tau PET imaging, tACS-EEG (transcranial alternating current&#xD;
      stimulation and electroencephalogram) assessment, TMS-EEG (transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      and electroencephalogram) plasticity assessment, functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI), blood and saliva sample collection, and optional lumbar puncture (LP). Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: stimulation for 2 weeks or 4 weeks, once a&#xD;
      day or twice a day. One of the groups is a sham group. This means that this group will not&#xD;
      receive actual tACS. Each session will be one hour of either individualized gamma-frequency&#xD;
      (40 Hz) tACS or sham tACS, depending on the assigned group. Subjects will be assessed for any&#xD;
      side effects before and after each session and complete a short memory and thinking test&#xD;
      either daily or weekly. At the end of the daily sessions, 5-7 follow up visits will include a&#xD;
      repeat of the baseline measures including amyloid and tau PET scans. Long-term follow-up&#xD;
      visits will include an EEG, cognitive testing and an amyloid PET scan. The PET imaging&#xD;
      studies will be conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital and up to 5 PET scans will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

    <description>tACS is a non-invasive way of stimulating the brain externally using weak electric currents. Electrodes are placed into a cap that you wear on your head. A weak electrical current travels back and forth through the electrodes to your head. tACS will be applied at a frequency of 40Hz and targeting the area of maximal tracer uptake on amyloid PET imaging using an individualized multielectrode design to maximize the induced electrical current to the target region.</description>
