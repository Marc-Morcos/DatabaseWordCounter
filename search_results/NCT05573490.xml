  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to generate preliminary data on the benefit of computerized&#xD;
      cognitive training and Tai Chi- Qi Gong training in participants with Early-Onset Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease. It is hypothesized that participants in the experimental training condition will&#xD;
      perform better on outcomes related to cognition, functioning, and mood at follow-up compared&#xD;
      to participants assigned to the active control condition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to generate preliminary data regarding the efficacy of a combined&#xD;
      cognitive-training and Tai Chi- Qi Gong exercise lifestyle intervention in participants&#xD;
      diagnosed with Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease. Participants will complete a series of&#xD;
      cognitive, functional, and mood assessments at a remotely-assessed baseline visit, and then&#xD;
      be randomized into one of two conditions: (1) Computerized Cognitive Training + Tai Chi&#xD;
      Exercise or (2) Active Control. Outcome measures will be repeated immediately Post-Treatment&#xD;
      and at 6-months post-treatment Follow-Up. Specific Aim 1 will examine the feasibility of this&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention and outcome assessments when applied to participants with EOAD.&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 will investigate if this lifestyle intervention improves short- and long-term&#xD;
      cognition, functioning, and mood. Specific Aim 3 will be exploratory to assess whether&#xD;
      individual differences in training or clinical/ demographic characteristics moderate the&#xD;
      degree of benefit from this intervention; owing to sample size limitations in this&#xD;
      feasibility study, focus of this latter aim will be on determining effect sizes and&#xD;
      sample-size magnitude needed for future work.&#xD;
