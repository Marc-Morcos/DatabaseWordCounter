  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) for an evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention for people with moderate to severe dementia. The psychosocial intervention is&#xD;
      adapted from Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) and developed within the Medical Research&#xD;
      Council (MRC) framework.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization calls for an increase of psychosocial interventions for&#xD;
      dementia-a global epidemic. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is the only&#xD;
      non-pharmacological therapy recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care&#xD;
      Excellence for improving cognition for mild to moderate dementia. However, there is little&#xD;
      guidance on how to maximise cognition for severe dementia. Advanced Cognitive Stimulation&#xD;
      Therapy (ACST) will be the first evidence-based complex intervention for moderate to severe&#xD;
      dementia developed within the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework and building upon&#xD;
      CST's key principles. This feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to 1) evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of ACST 2) explore if ACST can improve the cognitive function, and QoL, as&#xD;
      well as other outcomes including behaviour, engagement, and communication, for people with&#xD;
      moderate to severe dementia. A sample of 32 participants will be recruited, where 16 will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to ACST, and 16 to treatment as usual (TAU). Data will be collected pre&#xD;
      and post the 7-week intervention period. Improving cognition and QoL for people with moderate&#xD;
      to severe dementia is vital because dementia's prevalence is projected to reach 152 million&#xD;
      by 2050, resulting in excessive excess disability.&#xD;

    <description>Exploratory primary outcome; measured pre and post intervention with Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination (Molloy &amp; Standish, 1997) and Test for Severe Impairment (Albert &amp; Cohen, 1992). SMMSE has 11 questions with scores from 0 to 30, where a low score indicates poor performance. TSI has six domains: motor performance, language comprehension, language production, memory, general knowledge, and conceptualisation. Each domain has a maximum score of 4, and a higher score indicates better cognitive ability.</description>

    <description>Exploratory primary outcome; measured pre and post test with Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) (Logsdon et al., 2002). QoL-AD has 13-items, and a sum score range from 13 to 52; higher score denotes better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Exploratory secondary outcome; measured pre and post test with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (Cummings et al., 1997). NPI consists of 12 domains. Each question asks for a frequency of symptoms on a 4-point score, severity on a 3-point score, and distress on a 5-point scale. Higher score denotes higher frequency and severity.</description>

    <description>Exploratory secondary outcome; measured with the Group Observational Measurement of Engagement Tool (Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2017). GOME consists of 5-domains: attendance, engagement, active participation, attitude, and sleep.

    <description>Advanced Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (ACST), a psychosocial intervention, is the modified version of CST for people with moderate and severe dementia. Activities consist of more multisensory stimulation elements than the original CST. ACST will be prescribed to participants 45-minutes per week, biweekly for 7 weeks. The intervention will be delivered by two facilitators, such as a research staff, clinical psychologist trainee or care home staff.</description>
