  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study the investigators want to find out if a non-invasive electrical brain&#xD;
      stimulation method called RAVANS (also called tVNS) can have a beneficial effect on cognition&#xD;
      in older individuals. The investigators also want to understand whether certain individual&#xD;
      factors contribute to the effect of RAVANS on cognition. RAVANS is only used in research&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will be studied in 140 older individuals using a randomized cross-over&#xD;
      design of sham versus RAVANS stimulation (2 sessions separated by 4 weeks) during a&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task. Participants will then be randomized to&#xD;
      daily tVNS or sham sessions during 10 visits within two weeks, and two follow-up cognitive&#xD;
      assessments each after 2 months of the last intervention session. The face-name association&#xD;
      task will be the main outcome measure. The investigators will also draw blood twice to&#xD;
      examine whether the response on the outcome is dependent on Alzheimer's disease related&#xD;
      biomarker, and whether RAVANS has effects on inflammatory responses.&#xD;
