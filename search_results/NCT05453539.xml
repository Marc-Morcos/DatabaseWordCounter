      This study is a Phase 1, first-in-human, multi-center study to establish safety of ADx-001 in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers, and safety and proof of concept in patients with confirmed amyloid&#xD;
      plaques in the brain (confirmed by amyloid positron emission tomography (PET)). ADx-001 is a&#xD;
      novel, intravenously delivered, Gd- containing molecularly targeted liposomal product that is&#xD;
      being developed for use in contrast-enabled MR imaging of amyloid plaques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder of the brain and the&#xD;
      most common cause of dementia. It is characterized by the development of amyloid plaques and&#xD;
      neurofibrillary tangles. The A/T/N diagnostic criteria for AD, published by the National&#xD;
      Institutes for Aging and the Alzheimer's Association (2018) identify amyloid plaques as a&#xD;
      necessary condition for Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential neuroimaging examination for patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. MRI allows for the exclusion of other causes of dementia, such as normal&#xD;
      pressure hydrocephalus, brain tumors, subdural hematoma, or cerebrovascular disease. MRI also&#xD;
      permits the assessment of the atrophy pattern which may provide additional diagnostic or&#xD;
      predictive information. To date, however, MRI cannot prove the existence of amyloid plaques&#xD;
      in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, amyloid-targeting radiopharmaceuticals have been approved by several Regulatory&#xD;
      Authorities for use with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. Amyloid PET imaging is a&#xD;
      sensitive imaging biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, but PET is associated with radiation&#xD;
      exposure and has limited availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADx-001 is a novel, intravenously delivered, macrocyclic gadolinium (Gd)-based molecularly&#xD;
      targeted liposomal product that is being developed for use in contrast-enabled MR imaging of&#xD;
      amyloid plaques. ADx-001-enabled MRI is expected to allow the detection of amyloid plaques in&#xD;
      the human brain with sensitivity that is comparable to amyloid PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase 1, first-in-human, study to collect safety data and obtain&#xD;
      proof-of-concept of ADx-001 in healthy volunteers and subjects with proven amyloid plaques.&#xD;
      Data from this study will be used to support future clinical studies with ADx-001 in AD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The study is designed in 2 parts. The first part in healthy volunteers is supposed to&#xD;
      assess safety and tolerability in humans. In this study phase, 6 healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      included and receive a single dose of 0.016 mmol Gd/kg body weight, each. The first volunteer&#xD;
      will be a sentinel and observed for 14 days before the next volunteers will be included.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be recruited one-by-one with at least 24 h between the inclusion of&#xD;
      subsequent volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part in patients with proven amyloid plaques (proven by amyloid PET) is supposed&#xD;
      to provide proof of concept of ADx-001 MR signal enhancement in amyloid-rich brain regions&#xD;
      and to identify the lowest ADx-001 dose able to delineate amyloid plaques in the human brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient part will use a dose escalation design with a maximum of 4 dose groups, with 3-6&#xD;
      patients in each dose group. The starting dose for the first dose level will be 0.016 mmol&#xD;
      Gd/kg based on the NOAEL (0.5 mmol Gd/kg) established in the nonclinical development program,&#xD;
      the safety factor of 0.1 and the human equivalent dose (HED) conversion factor of 0.32 (0.5&#xD;
      mmol Gd/kg x 0.1 x 0.32 = 0.016 mmol Gd/kg). Dose escalation will be based on findings in MRI&#xD;
      and the occurrence of adverse events. Dose will be increased until no further increase in&#xD;
      imaging signal is expected; stopping rules will define the stop of dose escalation (or the&#xD;
      trial) based on safety considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will need to be kept in-patient for observation for 72 hours after&#xD;
      administration of ADx-001. At each dose level, the first patient will be a sentinel and&#xD;
      followed for 14 days after the dose (or until early termination). If no clinically relevant&#xD;
      adverse events or safety concerns occur during the first 14 days, additional 2 patients will&#xD;
      be sequentially administered ADx-001 at the same dose with at least 24 h between the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Dosing Committee (DC) will oversee dose escalation of this trial. The DC will be composed&#xD;
      of a board-certified radiologist, a physician specialized in a clinical discipline with&#xD;
      experience in the administration of injectable liposome formulations, and a board-certified&#xD;
      nuclear medicine physician as voting members. The DC will evaluate imaging and safety data,&#xD;
      decide if further dose increases are expected to increase imaging signal, decide if the trial&#xD;
      must be stopped following predefined stopping rules, decide if additional patients are to be&#xD;
      included at a given dose level, and propose the next dose level. It is expected that dose&#xD;
      levels will be gradually increased; however, the DC may also decide to lower the ADx-001 dose&#xD;
      (especially after imaging of patients at the first dose if signal enhancement in amyloid&#xD;
      plaques is already visible and judged as sufficient), or decide that no further dose levels&#xD;
      are to be tested. The DC may also recommend different imaging time points (as long as the&#xD;
      total number of imaging time points remains unaffected).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following dose escalation criteria will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) has been seen in the first 3 subjects in a dose level&#xD;
           and imaging signal is expected to increase with higher doses, then enrollment/dosing may&#xD;
           move to the next higher dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a DLT is seen in one of the first three subjects in a dose level, an additional 3&#xD;
           subjects will be enrolled into that same dose cohort. If only 1 DLT is seen in the first&#xD;
           6 subjects in a dose level and imaging signal is expected to increase with higher doses,&#xD;
           then enrollment/dosing may move to the next higher dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of DLTs in 2 or more subjects in a specific dose cohort will indicate that&#xD;
           the amount of drug tolerated has been exceeded, and further dose escalation will be&#xD;
           terminated irrespective of imaging findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The DC may recommend the next dose level be reduced from the previous dose (relevant for&#xD;
           the first dose level in patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, amyloid PET imaging will serve as a comparator. Eligible patients will have&#xD;
      a documented positive amyloid PET scan obtained within the 12 months prior to inclusion into&#xD;
      this study and are able to provide the original DICOM images of the PET scan to the imaging&#xD;
      core lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment will be done in a staggered approach. The time interval between injection&#xD;
      with ADx-001 of the sentinel and subsequent patients is 14 days, at minimum. Safety follow-up&#xD;
      of at least 7 days must be available in all 3 patients (or 6 patients if 1 DLT has been&#xD;
      observed) of a dose level before the next higher dose level is started.&#xD;
