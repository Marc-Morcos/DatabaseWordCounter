    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is rising, but existing medications provide only&#xD;
      modest control of cognitive decline and associated symptoms, and novel therapies are urgently&#xD;
      needed. This randomized sham-controlled trial will determine if an innovative low-risk&#xD;
      remotely-supervised transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied over the area of&#xD;
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 30 minutes at the intensity of 2 mA five times per&#xD;
      week for 6 months at home can improve cognitive performance and symptoms and modulate&#xD;
      neuroimaging markers of neuroplasticity in 100 patients with mild to moderate AD. If&#xD;
      effective, this novel intervention can substantially enhance AD symptom management at home,&#xD;
      improve quality of life of AD patients and their families, and reduce burden associated with&#xD;
      this debilitating illness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is cognitive decline with varied associated symptoms&#xD;
      and signs. Unfortunately, there is no cure as yet for AD. Available treatments, including 5&#xD;
      FDA-approved medications, have limited efficacy in terms of slowing pathological progression&#xD;
      or controlling the symptoms and signs of cognitive decline in AD patients. Given the high&#xD;
      burdens and costs of AD, and the therapeutic limitations, the development of novel treatment&#xD;
      approaches for AD is of the highest importance for patients, families, medical providers, and&#xD;
      society. This randomized controlled trial will determine if innovative, low-risk&#xD;
      neurostimulation at home for 6 months can improve cognitive performance and symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the effects produced by 6 months of active tDCS or sham&#xD;
      delivered over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in home settings on global cognitive&#xD;
      performance (assessed by ADAS-Cog test - primary outcome), and secondarily on executive&#xD;
      control/spatial selective attention (Eriksen Flanker Test), depressed mood (Geriatric&#xD;
      depression scale), quality of life (Quality of Life Questionnaire-Alzheimer's Disease), and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with both the device and procedure (Neurostimulation User's Survey), in&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate AD patients (n=100). The investigators also aim to determine functional and&#xD;
      structural brain connectivity/network changes in response to the study intervention using&#xD;
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI; during rest and during executive function&#xD;
      tasks), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and multivariate covariance-based analytic&#xD;
      approaches. Lastly, the investigators aim to examine time characteristics (durability) of the&#xD;
      tDCS behavioral and neuroplasticity effects for up to 3 months following the intervention&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of remotely supervised active tDCS stimulation and sham tDCS&#xD;
      stimulation over the area of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, applied at home for 30&#xD;
      minutes 5 times per week for 6 months. Participants randomized to the active tDCS will&#xD;
      receive at each application 30 minutes of direct current stimulation at the intensity of 2&#xD;
      mA. Participants randomized to the sham group will receive sham tDCS which consists of&#xD;
      current ramped up to 2mA over 30 seconds, ramped down over 30 seconds and stay at 0 current&#xD;
      for the remaining time of the 30-minute application.&#xD;

    <description>Change in The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) was developed as an outcome measure for dementia interventions; its primary purpose was to be an index of global cognition in response to therapies. It assesses multiple cognitive domains across 11 items: Word Recall Task, Naming Objects and Fingers, Following Commands, Constructional Praxis, Ideational Praxis, Orientation, Word Recognition Task, Remembering Test Directions, Spoken Language, Comprehension and Word-Finding Difficulty. The score ranges from 0 to 70. A 4-point ADAS-cog change at 6 months is clinically meaningful.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Community-dwelling male or female of age 60 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. AD diagnosed by neurologists or geriatricians at our dementia and geriatric clinical&#xD;
             sites. Clinicians will review the medical records of all potential cases to ensure the&#xD;
             patients meet established clinical criteria for AD, and also examine individuals as&#xD;
             needed to further establish the diagnosis. Mild-to moderate stage AD as determined by&#xD;
             study clinicians using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR). The CDR is a 5-point&#xD;
             scale used to characterize six domains of cognitive and functional performance&#xD;
             applicable to AD: Memory, Orientation, Judgment &amp; Problem Solving, Community Affairs,&#xD;
             Home &amp; Hobbies, and Personal Care. The necessary information to make each rating is&#xD;
             obtained through a semi-structured interview of the patient and a reliable informant&#xD;
             (e.g., family member). A CDR score of 0.5 or 1 is rated as mild severity and a score&#xD;
             of 2 is rated as moderate severity. The investigators selected mild to moderate AD&#xD;
             patients as our target population as they are the most prevalent AD severity group&#xD;
             referred to our clinics, increasing generalizability. This mild to moderate AD group&#xD;
             is also most likely to be cared for in the community and at home, in contrast to more&#xD;
             advanced or severe AD stages, which are more prevalent in institutional settings (and&#xD;
             will be the focus of our future studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If on dementia medication regimen, the regimen is stable for at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. The investigators will not restrict clinicians from starting, adjusting or&#xD;
             stopping dementia medications over the intervention period in keeping with the&#xD;
             pragmatic nature of our trial, but will account for medications in both groups in our&#xD;
             analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to speak and understand English or Spanish at a level sufficient undergo the&#xD;
             study procedures and testing protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing to complete an MRI (exclusions relevant to neuroimaging are described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to provide Informed Consent (or able to provide assent with a legal surrogate&#xD;
             providing informed consent.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unstable medical or major psychiatric illnesses or unstable treatments for medical or&#xD;
             major psychiatric illnesses. Any medical or psychiatric diagnosis is permitted as long&#xD;
             as it has been clinically stable for at least 3 months, reflected in part by stability&#xD;
             of treatments for at least 3 months, and is expected on the basis of clinical judgment&#xD;
             to be in a stable phase that will likely extend for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of head trauma, seizures, brain surgery, stroke or cancer affecting head,&#xD;
             metal implants in the head or neck, compromised integrity or sensitivity of the skin&#xD;
             at or near locations where electrodes will be placed (e.g., eczema, severe rashes,&#xD;
             blisters, open wounds, burn including sunburns, cuts or irritation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Currently participating in another intervention study or using neurostimulation&#xD;
             device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Exclusions specific to neuroimaging procedure: the presence of any surgically&#xD;
             implanted metallic devices, such as aneurysm clips or pacemakers that would be a&#xD;
             safety contraindication for MRI. Subjects with large amounts of dental or surgical&#xD;
             hardware in the head and neck will be excluded because magnetic susceptibility effects&#xD;
             will lead to severe image artifacts in these subjects' images. Due to the confined&#xD;
             space of the MRI magnet, subjects with a known history of claustrophobia will also be&#xD;
             excluded as will subjects with weight &gt;350lbs or waist circumference &gt;55 inches.&#xD;
