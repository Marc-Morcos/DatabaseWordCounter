  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late-life depression has been frequently associated with cognitive impairment. Several&#xD;
      meta-analyses consistently suggested that a history of depression approximately doubles an&#xD;
      individual's risk for developing dementia later in life. Neurodegeneration may play an&#xD;
      important component in late-life depression. The pathophysiology behind the link between&#xD;
      late-life depression and the subsequent development of dementia largely remains unclear, and&#xD;
      should be heterogeneous. This highlights the need to identify specific neurodegenerative&#xD;
      pathways involved in late-life depression, which will facilitate research on mechanisms and&#xD;
      new treatments in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recently published the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer Association (NIA-AA)&#xD;
      criteria might provide new insights and frameworks to explore the patterns of&#xD;
      neurodegenerative process in elderly depressed patients and to categorize them into different&#xD;
      biomarker-based groups. In the present project, the investigators will recruit 40 patients&#xD;
      with lifetime major depressive disorder, and 20 non-depressed cognitively normal comparison&#xD;
      subjects. Alzheimer's disease pathology (A) was determined by measuring Aβ deposition by F-18&#xD;
      AV-45 PET, and neurodegeneration (N) was established by measuring hippocampal volume using&#xD;
      MRI. Individuals were categorised as A-N-, A+N-, A+N+, or suspected non-Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      pathophysiology (A-N+, SNAP). All subjects will further undergo F-18-THK-5351 image study to&#xD;
      detect underlying tau pathology. By doing this, the investigators will elucidate the&#xD;
      neurodegenerative pathophysiology behind the link between depressive disorder and the&#xD;
      subsequent development of dementia.&#xD;

      Visit 1, Screening assessments (Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to determine eligibility for the proposed study. Screening period may take&#xD;
      place over several days to one week after the first visit. Screening assessments will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study explanations and obtainment of informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inclusion and exclusion Criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Demographics, medical history, and concomitant medications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical characteristic of MDD;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Safety measurements include vital sign, ECGs and laboratory tests. In addition, a&#xD;
           pregnancy test will be performed at screening for females who are of childbearing&#xD;
           potential (not for subjects with postmenopause period). A resting ECG and laboratory&#xD;
           tests will be taken during the period of the study visit or had been done within 3&#xD;
           months before study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Fertile females must avoid becoming pregnant 30 days after administration of F-18 AV-45&#xD;
           and 18F-THK-5351.The investigators will advise fertile females to use adequate&#xD;
           contraceptive methods during this period, e.g., established use of oral, injected or&#xD;
           implanted hormonal methods of contraception; placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
           or intrauterine system (IUS); barrier methods: condom with spermicidal&#xD;
           foam/gel/film/cream or occlusive cap(diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal&#xD;
           foam /gel /film /cream. In addition, a pregnancy test will be performed at screening for&#xD;
           females who are of childbearing potential (the test must be negative).This test is not&#xD;
           applicable for female subjects with postmenopausal period; permanently sterilized (eg,&#xD;
           bilateral tubal occlusion [which includes tubal ligation procedures as consistent with&#xD;
           local regulations], hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy); or&#xD;
           otherwise be incapable of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Cognitive function assessment includes MMSE, CDR and comprehensive neurocognitive&#xD;
           battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2, Image study (Month 1±14 days) F-18 AV-45 PET study will be conducted for all&#xD;
      subjects. PET data will be acquired using SIMENS PET/CT or PET/MRI scanner. For PET/CT&#xD;
      protocol, a dynamic brain PET scan will be started simultaneously with the injection of F-18&#xD;
      AV-45 PET after a low-dose CT scan for patient positioning and attenuation correction.&#xD;
      Instead of PET/CT, the investigators will also consider PET/MRI for better soft tissue&#xD;
      contrast and limited radiation exposure for multiple scan session. However, the attenuation&#xD;
      map delineated from MRI is not consistent, and the delicate PET/MRI protocol is still under&#xD;
      evaluation. Vital sign will be checked before and at the end of the image study for all&#xD;
      subjects. Subjects will be continuously observed for signs of adverse events or serious&#xD;
      adverse events. Each study participant (or their caregiver if applicable) will be contacted&#xD;
      by phone approximately 7-14 days after the PET imaging study or at the next follow-up visit&#xD;
      of outpatient department to confirm their well-being and query them about any new adverse&#xD;
      events. Study-emergent AEs will be monitored till resolution or relatively stable state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3, Image study (Month 1±14 days) All participants will receive F-18-THK-5351 PET image&#xD;
      study. PET data will be acquired using SIMENS PET/CT or PET/MRI scanner. For PET/CT protocol,&#xD;
      a dynamic brain PET scan will be started simultaneously with the injection of F-18-THK-5351&#xD;
      after a low-dose CT scan for patient positioning and attenuation correction. Instead of&#xD;
      PET/CT, the investigators will also consider PET/MRI for better soft tissue contrast and&#xD;
      limited radiation exposure for multiple scan session. However, the attenuation map delineated&#xD;
      from MRI is not consistent, and the delicate PET/MRI protocol is still under evaluation.&#xD;
      Vital sign will be checked before and after the image study. Safety measurements include ECG,&#xD;
      and clinical labs will be performed at the end of the image study for all subjects. Subjects&#xD;
      will be continuously observed for signs of adverse events or serious adverse events. Each&#xD;
      study participant (or their caregiver if applicable) will be contacted by phone approximately&#xD;
      7-14 days after the PET imaging study or at the next follow-up visit of outpatient department&#xD;
      to confirm their well-being and query them about any new adverse events. Study-emergent AEs&#xD;
      will be monitored till resolution or relatively stable state.&#xD;
