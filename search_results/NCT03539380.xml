      This is an expanded access program (EAP) for eligible participants. This program is designed&#xD;
      to provide continued access to TRx0237 to individual patients with early and mild-moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease who do not qualify for participation in an ongoing clinical trial.&#xD;
      Eligible participants must have previously completed participation in a clinical trial of&#xD;
      TRx0237 conducted by TauRx or have previously taken TRx0237 in a compassionate use program,&#xD;
      among other criteria.&#xD;
