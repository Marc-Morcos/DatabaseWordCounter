    <textblock>
      This trial will determine the pharmacokinetics of Posiphen® in both plasma and CSF after a&#xD;
      10-day treatment period with Posiphen® in subjects with amnestic MCI. The effects of this&#xD;
      treatment on biomarkers will also be determined in CSF, whole blood, and plasma or serum as&#xD;
      primary pharmacodynamic (PD) objectives.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Hamilton Depression rating scale (HAMD17) score of less than or equal to 12 with a&#xD;
             score of 0 on items 1, 2, and 3 (depressed mood, feelings of guilt, and suicidal&#xD;

          4. History of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence within the past 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with any febrile illness within 1 week prior to the CSF collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who have history of migraine headaches and any other type of headaches of at&#xD;
             least moderate severity more than twice per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any significant systemic illness or unstable medical condition which could lead to&#xD;
             difficulty complying with the protocol or pose potential risk to the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of medications prohibited by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects with infection or inflammation of the skin or skin disease at or in proximity&#xD;
             to the lumbar puncture site.&#xD;
