  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will assess long-term changes to health/lifestyle, advanced planning,&#xD;
      and research engagement that Black and White patients with Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment&#xD;
      (aMCI) make following disclosure of positron emission tomography-based amyloid and tau burden&#xD;
      and associated risk of conversion to Dementia-Alzheimer's Type. Healthcare access will be&#xD;
      explored as potential barrier to or facilitator of behavior change.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Randomized delayed start design. Participants are randomized to receive, at baseline, either 'Diagnostic Disclosure Protocol' (cognitive testing/diagnosis) with an option to receive biomarker results after 6 months or 'Biomarker Disclosure Protocol' (cognitive testing, diagnosis, positron emission tomography-based amyloid and tau imaging. They are further categorized by biomarker status (+/positive or -/negative) for reporting purposes.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Subscale is a part of the Stages of Change Interview. Respondents will rate seven items relating to behavioral changes they have made post-disclosure on a Likert scale ranging from 1 = &quot;I have not considered/am not interested in making this change&quot; to 5 = &quot;I have already made and maintained this change.&quot; Subscale score total ranges from 7 to 35 with higher scores indicating more engagement.</description>

    <description>Subscale is a part of the Stages of Change Interview. Respondents will rate two items relating to health communication using a Likert scale. Subscale score total ranges from 2 to 10 with higher scores indicating more engagement.</description>

    <description>Participants receive information about their cognitive test results and research diagnosis. In addition, participants receive information about whether they currently have elevated or not-elevated amyloid and/or tau based on recent PET imaging. PET is a type of imaging biomarker (Aß-PET and tau PET) for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. These actions are followed by post-disclosure dementia risk reduction counseling.&#xD;

    <description>Participants receive information about their cognitive test results and research diagnosis just like in the diagnostic disclosure protocol. In addition, participants receive information about whether they currently have elevated or not-elevated amyloid and/or tau based on recent PET imaging. PET is a type of imaging biomarker (Aß-PET and tau PET) for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. These actions are followed by post-disclosure dementia risk reduction counseling.</description>
