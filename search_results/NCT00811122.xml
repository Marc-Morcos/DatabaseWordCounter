  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and&#xD;
      neuronal cell loss. Amyloid plaques are believed to play an integral role in AD. Elevated&#xD;
      levels of Aβ in the brain are correlated with cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no approved ways to measure amyloid load in humans. Several compounds are under&#xD;
      investigation. All of these compounds use radioactive chemical tags for positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) imaging. The most promising compound is 11C-PIB, or Pittsburgh Compound-B.&#xD;
      This compound can be injected and a PET scan performed. This allows doctors to see the&#xD;
      amyloid plaques in the brain, and to use this information to look at other types of dementia&#xD;
      to see if there are differences and/or similarities in the plaques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit a total of 30 subjects, 10 from each of the following three diagnostic&#xD;
      categories: frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease, and normal volunteers. All&#xD;
      subjects will be given an [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose or FDG-PET scan (if they haven't had one in&#xD;
      the past) and a PIB-PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this project is to study the biodistribution of 11C-PIB using PET&#xD;
      imaging in normal elderly volunteers and relevant patient groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have recently become extremely important for a number&#xD;
      of reasons: to improve diagnosis, to measure severity of disease, to measure progression of&#xD;
      disease, to measure effects of novel disease-modifying drugs and to speed development of&#xD;
      these novel experimental drugs by reducing time needed to follow patients, number of patients&#xD;
      to be followed per study, and cost of research. (Thal, 2006, Nichols, 2006)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neuropathology of AD is characterized by neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and&#xD;
      neuronal cell loss (Braak and Braak, 1997). Amyloid plaques are believed to play an integral&#xD;
      role in AD (Selkoe, 1993). Plaques are neurotoxic (Yankner, 1989). Elevated levels of Aβ in&#xD;
      the brain are correlated with cognitive decline (Naslund, 2000). Removal of plaques in animal&#xD;
      models of AD results in behavioral improvements (Arendash, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no approved in vivo markers of amyloid load in humans. Several compounds with&#xD;
      affinity for binding amyloid in vivo are under investigation. All of these compounds use&#xD;
      radioactive chemical tags for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Attempts at finding&#xD;
      non-radioactive amyloid tracers are underway, but still poorly developed. The most promising&#xD;
      compound is 11C-PIB. Pittsburgh Compound-B has statistically significant increased retention&#xD;
      in AD cortical areas, relative to controls (P&lt;0.05). (Price, 2005) To our knowledge, 11C-PIB&#xD;
      imaging has not been compared against frontotemporal dementia (FTD) controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit (from our clinic population), a total of 30 subjects, 10 from each of the&#xD;
      following 3 diagnostic categories: frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and normal&#xD;
      volunteers. All subjects will be given an FDG-PET scan (if they haven't had one in the past)&#xD;
      and a PIB-PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this project is to study the biodistribution of 11C-PIB using PET&#xD;
      imaging in normal elderly volunteers and relevant patient groups. Comparison with FDG-PET is&#xD;
      essential to confirm group membership and for anatomic co-registration of 11C-PIB images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine the biodistribution of 11C-PIB in AD, FTD, and cognitively normal&#xD;
      elderly individuals and determine whether it reflects the distribution of amyloid plaques in&#xD;
      the brain expected from postmortem studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: The agent 11C-PIB has similar biodistribution outside the brain in AD, FTD, and&#xD;
      cognitively normal elderly individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Patients with AD scanned with 11C-PIB will have higher standardized uptake&#xD;
      values (SUVs) than cognitively normal elderly in brain regions where beta amyloid are&#xD;
      expected to be over-expressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Patients with FTD scanned with 11C-PIB will have similar standardized uptake&#xD;
      values (SUVs) as cognitively normal elderly subjects and lower values than in AD subjects in&#xD;
      brain regions where beta amyloid are expected in AD to be overexpressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Correlate glucose metabolism with 11C-PIB PET results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Patients with a pattern of glucose hypometabolism suggestive of FTD with&#xD;
      FDG-PET have 11C-PIB uptake and brain biodistribution similar to cognitively normal elderly,&#xD;
      while those with a pattern of glucose hypometabolism suggestive of AD have abnormal PIB&#xD;
      uptake and brain biodistribution of 11C-PIB&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All participants will be between 30-90 years old, inclusive, clinically characterized&#xD;
             as having AD, having FTD, or being cognitively normal controls (NC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All subjects must be willing and able to undergo testing procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine - symptomatic drugs approved for AD - will be&#xD;
             allowed since these drugs are not expected to significantly affect amyloid load.&#xD;
&#xD;
        General inclusion criteria are shown below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Normal subjects: Healthy individuals aged to match AD and FTD groups, who are&#xD;
             non-depressed, non-demented, and without a complaint of memory loss. A brief&#xD;
             neuropsychological test, the 3MS-R or Modified Mini-Mental State Examination, Revised&#xD;
             (Tschanz et al., 2002), will be given to confirm that the subject is not cognitively&#xD;
             impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. FTD subjects: Patients seen in the University of Utah (UU) Cognitive Disorders Clinic&#xD;
             (CDC) who have been clinically characterized and meet Neary criteria for&#xD;
             frontotemporal dementia (Neary et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. AD subjects: Patients seen in the UU CDC who have been clinically characterized to&#xD;
             meet NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD (McKhann et al., 1984). These criteria were&#xD;
             established in 1984 for diagnosis of AD by the National Institute of Neurological and&#xD;
             Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and Alzheimer's Disease and Related&#xD;
             Disorders Association (ADRDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with medical conditions that have a high risk of associated cognitive&#xD;
             symptoms such as transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, seizures, or head injury&#xD;
             with loss of consciousness within five years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with Axis I psychiatric diagnoses other than treated depression&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who are not medically stable will be excluded from the study. Examples of&#xD;
             medically unstable patients include uncontrolled hypertension, heart/liver/renal&#xD;
             failure, and other conditions requiring acute medical attention&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects cannot have a serum glucose level greater than 180 mg/dl for FDG-PET imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who are too claustrophobic to undergo FDG-PET or 11C PIB-PET imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who require conscious sedation or anesthesia to undergo FDG-PET or 11C&#xD;
             PIB-PET imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who are unable to follow instructions to urinate after completing scanning&#xD;
             procedures&#xD;
