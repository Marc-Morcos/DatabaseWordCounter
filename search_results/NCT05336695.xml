    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to quantify brain fibrin content using 64Cu-FBP8-PET in the&#xD;
      brains of subjects ranging from cognitively normal to clinically diagnosed with ADRD to&#xD;
      evaluate potential regional differences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While there are many potential therapeutics being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease and&#xD;
      related dementias (ADRD), there is currently no known cure for ADRD and its origin and&#xD;
      pathophysiology are still not well understood. However, the association of fibrin with ADRD&#xD;
      is becoming increasingly clearer. Up to now it was not possible to quantify brain fibrin in&#xD;
      vivo to better elucidate its role in ADRD, but recently, 64Cu-FBP8 was proposed as a tool to&#xD;
      detect thrombus anywhere in the body. This unique tool will allow us to non-invasively assess&#xD;
      brain fibrin levels in at-risk and ADRD subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to use 64Cu-FBP8-PET in the brains of subjects ranging from&#xD;
      cognitively normal to clinically diagnosed with ADRD to assess fibrin levels. It is expected&#xD;
      that about 30 people will take part in this research study. 64Cu-FBP8-PET is not currently&#xD;
      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
