    <description>Delirium was detected using the short form of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) both at admission and daily throughout the hospital stay. Cognitive status was determined using the Mini-Mental State Exam, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Dementia was defined by a CDR score of 1. The primary independent variable was a composite of delirium and dementia diagnosis, and we examined the overlap by categorizing the cases into four groups: no delirium or dementia, dementia alone, delirium alone, and DSD.</description>
