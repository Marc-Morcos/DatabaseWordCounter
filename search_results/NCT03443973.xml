  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of gantenerumab versus placebo in participants with early (prodromal to&#xD;
      mild) AD. All participants must show evidence of beta-amyloid pathology. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either subcutaneous (SC) injection of&#xD;
      gantenerumab or placebo. The primary efficacy assessment will be performed at the end of the&#xD;
      double blind period at week 116. Participants will then be offered to enter into an&#xD;
      open-label extension (OLE). Participants not willing to go to the OLE will participate in a&#xD;
      long term follow-up period for up to 50 weeks after the last gantenerumab dose.&#xD;
