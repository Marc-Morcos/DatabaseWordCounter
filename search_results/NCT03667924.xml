  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inability of healthcare systems to effectively manage Alzheimer's disease and related&#xD;
      dementias (ADRD) often results in families remaining unaware of important community-based,&#xD;
      long-term services and supports (LTSS) that could help to mitigate the negative effects of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. This project will feature a collaboration between Lutheran Social&#xD;
      Service of Minnesota and the University of Minnesota to evaluate a novel adaption of the&#xD;
      volunteer Senior Companion Program (SCP) to: a) assist families better manage ADRD at home;&#xD;
      b) identify and facilitate the use of LTSS; and c) improve engagement with primary care&#xD;
      providers throughout the state of Minnesota. If successful, the PorchLight Project will offer&#xD;
      a potentially efficient, wide-ranging service model for states and communities to implement&#xD;
      for persons with ADRD and their caregiving families.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate a novel adaption of the Senior Companion Program (SCP)&#xD;
      administered by Lutheran Social Service of Minnesota to assist families better manage their&#xD;
      relatives' Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRDs); identify and facilitate use of&#xD;
      community-based long-term services and supports (LTSS); and improve engagement with&#xD;
      healthcare providers. This intervention, called the PorchLight Project has the following&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Implement PorchLight Project for 25 persons with ADRD or memory concerns&#xD;
      (collectively, persons with memory loss [PWML]) and/or their caregivers in one urban and&#xD;
      rural region of Minnesota. A convergent parallel mixed methods design [(QUAN+QUAL)--&gt;QUAL]&#xD;
      will be utilized to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of PorchLight Project&#xD;
      for 25 families and their SC-Ds (n = 20) over a 3-month period (i.e., Stage I of the NIH&#xD;
      Stage Model).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Refine PorchLight Project delivery and implementation for efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation. Activities to support this aim will include assessment of R61 milestones and&#xD;
      incorporation of R61 findings to refine the PorchLight Project prior to efficacy evaluation.&#xD;
      Through stakeholder engagement with the Dementia Healthcare Research Advisory Group (DHR) as&#xD;
      well as analysis of the various quantitative and qualitative data elements collected during&#xD;
      this Phase, we will finalize and refine effective training approaches for PorchLight Project&#xD;
      Senior Companions (SCs), identify and confirm stakeholder-centric measures, and enhance the&#xD;
      overall implementation of the PorchLight Project to inform a subsequent R33 Phase.&#xD;
