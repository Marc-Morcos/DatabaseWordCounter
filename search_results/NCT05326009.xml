    <textblock>
      In this study, a total of 60 AD patients with Aβ deposition will beenrolled.Qualified&#xD;
      subjects will complete PET imaging scan of Tau imaging agent inXuanwuHospital, and each&#xD;
      subject will receive three of the following five imaging agents: PI-2620, APN1607, AV1451,&#xD;
      RO948 or GTP1.The imaging time interval between the two tracers should be at least 4 days but&#xD;
      less than 4 weeks. All PET scans of each subject were completed within 3 months.To compare&#xD;
      the different Tau tracers' binding ability (SUVR or Tau distribution change) of the same&#xD;
      subject in AD population. Obtain the safety data of each tracer after injection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with AD in prodromal stage, mild or moderate degree, who have stable medical&#xD;
      condition and meet the inclusion criteria, do not meet any exclusion criteria, will be&#xD;
      eligible for inclusion in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [18F] florbetapir PET imaging will be used to evaluate amyloid deposition during the&#xD;
      screening period. If [18F] florbetapir imaging confirmed amyloid deposition based on positive&#xD;
      visual reading and SUVR &gt; 1.1, the patient was considered to be amyloid deposition&#xD;
      positive.After the subjects enter the group, the comprehensive collection of clinical&#xD;
      information, the assessment of cognitive related scale and the collection and detection of&#xD;
      biological samples are carried out. Qualified subjects will complete PET imaging scan of Tau&#xD;
      imaging agent in Xuanwu Hospital, and each subject will receive three of the following five&#xD;
      imaging agents: PI-2620, APN1607, AV1451, RO948 or GTP1. All subjects will sign the tracer&#xD;
      related informed consent before PET tracer injection. Imaging will be carried out as detailed&#xD;
      in the technical operation manual. PET center staff will closely observe and evaluate adverse&#xD;
      events of subjects throughout the process, and allow them to leave the hospital after&#xD;
      confirming medical stability. After 48 hours of scanning, the staff will follow up the&#xD;
      subjects by telephone to confirm the health status of the subjects and record the information&#xD;
      related to adverse events. The imaging time interval between the two tracers should be at&#xD;
      least 4 days but less than 4 weeks. All PET scans of each subject were completed within 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
