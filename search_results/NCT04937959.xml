  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether a set of algorithms analysing&#xD;
      acoustic and linguistic patterns of speech can detect amyloid-specific cognitive impairment&#xD;
      in early stage Alzheimer's disease, based on archival spoken or written language samples, as&#xD;
      measured by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve of&#xD;
      the binary classifier distinguishing between amyloid positive and amyloid negative arms.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include (1) evaluating how many years before diagnosis of Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (MCI) such algorithms work, as measured on binary classifier performance of the&#xD;
      classifiers trained to classify MCI vs cognitively normal (CN) arms using archival material&#xD;
      from the following time bins before MCI diagnosis: 0-5 years, 5-10 years, 10-15 years, 15-20&#xD;
      years, 20-25 years; (2) evaluating at what age such algorithms can detect later amyloid&#xD;
      positivity, as measured on binary classifier performance of the classifiers trained to&#xD;
      classify amyloid positive vs amyloid negative arms using archival material from the following&#xD;
      age bins: younger than 50, 50-55, 55-60, 65-70, 70-75 years old.&#xD;
