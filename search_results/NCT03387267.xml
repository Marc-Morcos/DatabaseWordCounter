      The study procedure of simultaneous VFSS and DDS measurement will be completed in one day and&#xD;
      the subject will be followed within 2 business days after the study procedure to monitor for&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DDS signals and VFSS will be recorded simultaneously (for the same bolus) using barium&#xD;
      contrast agent stimuli prepared in three consistencies: thin, mildly-thick and&#xD;
      moderately-thick. Subjects will undergo VFSS with simultaneous DDS using up to 5 boluses of&#xD;
      thin barium stimulus (&quot;THIN-Ba&quot;), and up to 4 boluses of barium thickened to mildly&#xD;
      (&quot;MILD-Ba&quot;) thick and up to 4 boluses of moderately (&quot;MODERATE-Ba&quot;) thick barium&#xD;
      consistencies using Resource Thicken Up Clear Nestlé Health Science (TUC). 4, 3 and 3 boluses&#xD;
      for THIN-Ba, MILD-Ba and MOD-Ba will be analyzed using the classifier algorithms for&#xD;
      sensitivity/specificity results. According to the exploratory trial, VFSS data for safety or&#xD;
      efficiency can be missing for up to 14% boluses due to quality of VFSS recording. To&#xD;
      compensate for potential losses of boluses due to missing gold standard (VFSS) data, 5, 4 and&#xD;
      4 boluses will be collected for the three consistencies respectively . The DDS signals will&#xD;
      be sent to a dedicated application software installed at the CRO, which interprets the&#xD;
      acceleration data and displays the examination result. The VFSS recording will be sent to CRO&#xD;
      and provided for blinded assessment by the independent central VFSS laboratory.The study&#xD;
      procedure of simultaneous VFSS and DDS measurement will be completed in one day and the&#xD;
      subject will be followed within 2 business days after the study procedure to monitor for&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The clinical trial will initially start as a 3-look group sequential design (GSD). Alpha-spending will be calculated using Lan-DeMets spending function (with O'Brien-Fleming parameter). At the first interim analysis (IA-1) the threshold on the ROC curve may be re-computed using the ROC curve generated using the IA-1 data, in which case, the validation trial would start afresh following IA-1 using a 2-look GSD. Data included in the IA-1 would no longer be used for the validation phase.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve to Compare the DDS Predicted Swallow Safety Outcome (Binary) vs. Clinical Reference Standard VFS for THIN-Ba</measure>
    <time_frame>The study procedure of simultaneous VFSS and DDS measurement using thin barium (THIN-Ba) was completed in one day for each subject.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy of the DDS was measured as the sensitivity &amp; specificity obtained from comparing the DDS predicted swallow safety outcome (binary) with the clinical reference standard VFSS swallow safety outcome (binary) for thin barium (THIN-Ba) stimuli, using 5 boluses per subject protocol. ROC (AUC) was used for comparing the 2 algorithms.&#xD;
The ROC curve incorporates both sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) providing a single assessment incorporating both measures. The higher the total area under the curve, the greater the predictive power of the outcome.&#xD;
Primary analysis for futility was based on 242 subjects (Interim Analysis). The study was terminated based on futility as the AUC for primary endpoint (0.64) was less than the guiding futility bound of 0.75.</description>

    <description>The Nestle Health Sciences (NHSc) Dysphagia Detection System (DDS) is a portable, non-invasive device designed for use at the bedside. The investigational DDS has 3 basic components: Sensor Unit (suspended on a necklace), Sensor Fixation and a personal computer (PC) for collecting data. The Sensor Unit consists of a dual-axis accelerometer in a plastic housing that is attached to the front of a patient's neck just below the thyroid cartilage by the single-use, disposable fixation unit. The Sensor Unit is connected via a cable to an A/D converter which then connects via cable to the PC. The PC collects the examination data, which is then sent to dedicated application software (installed at the CRO), which interprets the acceleration data and displays the examination result.</description>

          <description>An operationally seamless single-arm, prospective, multicenter, single-blinded for central outcomes assessors trial to test DDS in assessing swallowing safety and efficiency in patients at risk of oropharyngeal dysphagia.&#xD;
Dysphagia Detection System: The Nestle Health Sciences (NHSc) Dysphagia Detection System (DDS) is a portable, non-invasive device designed for use at the bedside. The investigational DDS has 3 basic components: Sensor Unit (suspended on a necklace), Sensor Fixation and a personal computer (PC) for collecting data. The Sensor Unit consists of a dual-axis accelerometer in a plastic housing that is attached to the front of a patient's neck just below the thyroid cartilage by the single-use, disposable fixation unit. The Sensor Unit is connected via a cable to an A/D converter which then connects via cable to the PC. The PC collects the examination data, which is then sent to dedicated application software (installed at the CRO), which interprets the acceleration data and displays the examination result.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve to Compare the DDS Predicted Swallow Safety Outcome (Binary) vs. Clinical Reference Standard VFS for THIN-Ba</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy of the DDS was measured as the sensitivity &amp; specificity obtained from comparing the DDS predicted swallow safety outcome (binary) with the clinical reference standard VFSS swallow safety outcome (binary) for thin barium (THIN-Ba) stimuli, using 5 boluses per subject protocol. ROC (AUC) was used for comparing the 2 algorithms.&#xD;
The ROC curve incorporates both sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) providing a single assessment incorporating both measures. The higher the total area under the curve, the greater the predictive power of the outcome.&#xD;
Primary analysis for futility was based on 242 subjects (Interim Analysis). The study was terminated based on futility as the AUC for primary endpoint (0.64) was less than the guiding futility bound of 0.75.</description>
        <time_frame>The study procedure of simultaneous VFSS and DDS measurement using thin barium (THIN-Ba) was completed in one day for each subject.</time_frame>
        <population>The interim analysis data consists of all subjects enrolled and completed before the data cut-off date. The analysis data set consisted of N=253 subjects with N=242 subjects meeting all inclusion-exclusion criteria and having at least one successfully completed Thin bolus swallow measurement (both VFS and DDS).</population>

            <description>Dysphagia Detection System: The Nestle Health Sciences (NHSc) Dysphagia Detection System (DDS) is a portable, non-invasive device designed for use at the bedside. The investigational DDS has 3 basic components: Sensor Unit (suspended on a necklace), Sensor Fixation and a personal computer (PC) for collecting data. The Sensor Unit consists of a dual-axis accelerometer in a plastic housing that is attached to the front of a patient's neck just below the thyroid cartilage by the single-use, disposable fixation unit. The Sensor Unit is connected via a cable to an A/D converter which then connects via cable to the PC. The PC collects the examination data, which is then sent to dedicated application software (installed at the CRO), which interprets the acceleration data and displays the examination result.</description>
