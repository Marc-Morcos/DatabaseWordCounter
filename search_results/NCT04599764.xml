  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon meeting the inclusion criteria and providing informed consent, each participant will&#xD;
      complete a series of cognitive assessments and tDCS at the hospital outpatient clinics or&#xD;
      inpatient department. Participants were randomly allocated to anode tDCS group with cognitive&#xD;
      training, anode tDCS group and the sham group. There are about 20 participants in each group.&#xD;
      Participants were studied using a double-blind design. Study participants and all personnel&#xD;
      responsible for the effects of the participants remained masked to allocated condition and&#xD;
      allocation parameters. Only tDCS administrators had access to the randomization list; they&#xD;
      had minimal contact with the participants, and no role in cognitive assessments. For the&#xD;
      first 30 participants, allocation was decided by draw. For the subsequent 30 patients,&#xD;
      allocation was according to computer generated random numbers. Each participant would be&#xD;
      treated for 10 days in two weeks by HD-tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the tDCS, a series of cognitive assessments and neuropsychological tests were obtained&#xD;
      by a trained investigator to assess baseline. Each assessment will involve a set of&#xD;
      assessment tools, including Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale&#xD;
      (ADAS-Cog), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and associative memory as the primary&#xD;
      outcome measure and various other tasks and questionnaires to measure cognition(DS, Stroop&#xD;
      test, VFT, SDMT), memory (AVLT, AMT, working memory test), emotion(HAMA-17, HAMD-14,&#xD;
      eye-tracking technolodgy), executive function(SST, WSCT, GDT) and stimulation tolerability.&#xD;
      All the tests are conducted in two days. The participants had receiving a magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging scan in multi-modalities, and electroencephalography (EEG) record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations were conducted one week after treatment and at the end of two weeks of treatment,&#xD;
      as well as the Global Index of Safety to assess adverse events of the stimulation.&#xD;
      Participants were instructed to focus their answers on the past 7/14 days. The participants&#xD;
      had also receiving a battery measure of neuropsychological tests, magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      scan in multi-modalities, and EEG record. All tests were instructed to finished within 24&#xD;
      hours after the last stimulation. One month and three months after the last stimulation,&#xD;
      participants were interviewed to obtain the same assessment as before. They were instructed&#xD;
      to focus their answers on the past months.&#xD;

We adopted a localized version (Mandarin version，includes 2 alternative versions) in line with the Chinese cultural background.It includes 11 inspection items in 8 cognitive fields, including visual structure skills, executive function, naming, attention and calculation, language, abstract thinking, memory, and orientation. With a total score of 30 or more than 26, it is normal. Anyone who has been education for less than 12 years will need to add one point to his final score.</description>

    <description>The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was created in 1982 by Brank et al. and is dedicated to screening for depression in the elderly. The most suitable feelings for the elderly in the past week were evaluated.There are 30 items in the scale, the total score is 30 points. The higher the score, the more obvious the depressive symptoms. It is generally considered that less than 10 points is normal.</description>

Each version contains 35 images, of which the official test consists of 30 images, and the other 5 images are for the participants to learn. The final score is the correct number of subjects to answer, the full score is 30 points, the higher the score, the better the space perception ability of the subject.</description>

It consists of 30 items，and each question is 1 point and the total score is 30 points. The final score is the correct number of subjects to answer, the full score is 30 points, the higher the score, the better the space perception ability of the subject.</description>

The subject is required to correctly read the target color on the stimulus card and record the completion time. The final completion time is the score of the participant. The shorter the time used, the better the performance of the subjects.</description>
