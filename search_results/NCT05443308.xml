  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimers disease and cerebral small vessel disease have a considerably overlap in patients&#xD;
      and have common risk factors. The diseases are difficult to separate in individual patients&#xD;
      and we hypothesize that a reduced cerebral vascular reserve may be a measurement of small&#xD;
      vessel disease independent of Alzheimers disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with presumed Alzheimers disease (n=20), cerebral small vessel disease (n=20) and&#xD;
      healthy age-matched subjects (n=15) are examined with quantitative [15O]H2O positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) for measurements of brain perfusion before and after diamox infusion that&#xD;
      dilates cerebral vessels. Additional [15O]H2O PET scans of the heart allows for a&#xD;
      non-invasive input function so the cerebral vascular reserve can be measured quantitatively.&#xD;

      Alzheimers disease and cerebral small vessel disease are increasingly common in the elderly&#xD;
      population and constitute around 90% of new dementia cases in Denmark. The diseases have a&#xD;
      considerably overlap in patients and have common risk factors. The cause of dementia can be&#xD;
      difficult to separate in individual patients but a reduced cerebral vascular reserve may be a&#xD;
      measurement of small vessel disease independent of Alzheimers disease. We hypothesized that&#xD;
      patient with small vessel disease have reduced increase in brain perfusion after medical&#xD;
      brain vessel dilatation. While Alzheimer patients may have reduced perfusion in rest but&#xD;
      normal increase after medical brain vessel dilatation as compared to healthy subjects.&#xD;
