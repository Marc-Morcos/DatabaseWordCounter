  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, non-interventional study of aducanumab-avwa&#xD;
      as prescribed in the post-marketing setting in the US. Investigators will be prescribing&#xD;
      aducanumab-avwa and participants will be treated according to the standard of care (SoC).&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up to 5 years after enrollment and data will be collected at&#xD;
      routine visits every 6 to 12 months.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    As a result of the national policy for coverage, it is expected there will be limited&#xD;
    aducanumab-avwa prescription and usage in routine clinical practice making the study not&#xD;
    feasible for enrollment.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Quick Dementia Rating Scale Informant Version &amp; Patient Version (QDRS-IV/PV) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>QDRS-IV /PV is rapid dementia staging tool. It is a 10-item questionnaire completed by an informant and a participant. The 10 domains covered are memory and recall, orientation, decision-making and problem-solving abilities, activities outside the home, function at home and hobbies, toileting and personal hygiene, behavior and personality changes, language and communication abilities, mood, and attention and concentration. Each domain is rated on five-point scale with increasing severity of symptoms. Total scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores representing greater cognitive impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire Short Version (A-IADL-Q-SV) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>A-IADL-Q-SV is used to measure activities of daily living (ADL) in earliest stages of dementia. It consist of 30 items in 7 categories. All items are rated on a five-point scale, ranging from 'no difficulty' to 'unable to perform'. Scoring is based on item response theory (IRT). A-IADL-Q-SV meet all the basic assumptions of IRT scoring, based on a Graded Response Model: (1) Unidimensionality, which implies that one underlying latent trait determines the items; (2) Local independence, meaning the independence of item responses, conditional on the latent trait; and (3) Monotonicity, meaning the probability of endorsing higher item categories as the trait level increases. The IRT latent trait levels are transformed into a 'T-score' with a range from approximately 20 to 80, a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, with higher 'T-scores' indicating better IADL functioning.</description>

    <description>FAQ is a 10-item questionnaire designed to assess independence in participants with Alzheimer's Disease by measuring instrumental activities of daily living. Each question is rated on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = normal to 3 = dependent). Total score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating more impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI-Q assesses twelve behavioral domains common in dementia including; hallucinations, delusions, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, irritability, disinhibition, euphoria, apathy, aberrant motor behavior, sleep/night-time behavior change, and appetite/eating change. The questionnaire is given by the clinician to the patient's caregiver who is asked if the behavior described is present in the patient. If &quot;Yes&quot;, the informant then rates both the Severity of the symptoms present within the last month on a 3-point scale (1 = mild, 2= moderate, and 3= severe) and the associated impact of the symptom manifestations on them (i.e. Caregiver Distress) using a 5-point scale (0 = not distressing at all, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, and 5 = extreme or very severe). The total severity score represents the sum of individual scores and ranges from 0 to 36. The total distress score represents the sum of individual symptom scores and ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS-SF) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is the screening test for depression in elderly people. The questionnaire contains 15 items. Participants indicate the presence or absence of each symptom. The GDS-SF score is the total number of positive depressive items. Score range is from 0-15. Scores of 0-4 are considered normal, 5-8 indicate mild depression, 9-11 indicate moderate depression and 12-15 indicate severe depression.</description>

    <description>The scale includes 13 items of life domains including the participant's physical health, mood, relationships, activities, and ability to complete tasks. Each item is scored using a scale of 1-4 (poor, fair, good, or excellent). Total score ranges 13-52; higher scores indicate better QOL.</description>
