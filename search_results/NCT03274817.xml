  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated study comparing two types of FDA-approved anti-depressants,&#xD;
      Escitalopram and Venlafaxine, to placebo, in order to determine if these medications have&#xD;
      positive effects on cognition and memory in those who are between the ages of 50 to 89 years&#xD;
      old, who are cognitively normal, and who have subjective memory concerns. Research has shown&#xD;
      that those who are cognitively normal but report subjective cognitive impairment are more&#xD;
      likely to progress to mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in the future.&#xD;
      Anti-depressants such as Escitalopram and Venlafaxine have been shown to stimulate production&#xD;
      of neurons in memory-sensitive areas such as the hippocampus. Therefore, the investigator is&#xD;
      researching whether these drugs would help cognition in those with subjective cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, and would help to prevent cognitive decline and eventual Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) and be free of objective&#xD;
             evidence of cognitive impairment. Operationally, this will be defined as subjects with&#xD;
             Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) score of stage 2.4&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be between 60 and 80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a knowledgeable informant (study partner) who can accompany them to&#xD;
             the evaluations, or, when necessary, be available for telephone contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be otherwise healthy and fulfill all of the inclusion criteria for&#xD;
             participation in the NYU ADC. Exclusion criteria are enumerated below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be in a position to comply with all of the study procedures described&#xD;
             herein.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a minimum of 12 years of education.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be fluent in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects original language at birth and/or, in childhood, must have been English,&#xD;
             alone, or in conjunction with other languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have normal brain aging, who are free of subjective cognitive impairment&#xD;
             (SCI), and are therefore categorized at GDS stage 1, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with MCI or dementia and are therefore categorized as being at GDS stage 3 or&#xD;
             greater, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a mini mental status examination (MMSE) score61 of ≤ 27 will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) score ≥ 16,62 signifying the presence&#xD;
             of notable depressive symptomatology which warrants treatment, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a primary diagnosis of depression or with a major depression diagnosis&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a significant medical, neurologic, or psychiatric condition, including&#xD;
             depression or anxiety disorder, that might interfere with cognition will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of adverse reactions to escitalopram and/or venlaflaxine will&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, who are judged to have had adverse reactions to selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
             inhibitor medications as a class, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects taking the antibiotic Zyvox (linezolid) or methylene blue therapy or who are&#xD;
             planning to have a diagnostic procedure utilizing methylene blue dye, will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are on psychoactive or cognitively active medications or who have&#xD;
             received such medications in the prior 8 weeks, will be excluded. These excluded&#xD;
             medications encompass antidepressant medications, antipsychotic medications,&#xD;
             anxiolytic medications, cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, antiseizure medications,&#xD;
             antiparkinsonian medication and other CNS acting medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are receiving other medications or substances with reported neurogenic&#xD;
             enhancer or neurogenic inhibitor effects will not be excluded. The reason for this&#xD;
             inclusionary approach is that just as the effects of neurogenic enhancers on&#xD;
             Alzheimer's disease appears to be complex (specifically, likely useful in prevention,&#xD;
             possibly not useful effects on disease progression), the same complexity apparently&#xD;
             applies to substances with reported neurogenic enhancer or inhibitor effects. For&#xD;
             example, the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan has been reported to suppress&#xD;
             running enhanced neurogenesis in the rat.63 This same medication and medication class&#xD;
             has also been reported to be useful in improving memory64 and in the prevention of&#xD;
             Alzheimer's disease, possibly by other mechanisms.65&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of significant cerebrovascular disease will be excluded. This&#xD;
             will be identified by one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. history of stroke. ii. Any focal signs of significant neuropathology from the&#xD;
             neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iii. A score of ≥ 4 on the Rosen modification of the Hachinski Ischemia Scale.66 iv. Focal&#xD;
        pathology on the MRI scan, indicative of history of infarction. l. Past history of brain&#xD;
        damage, seizure, mental retardation or serious neurological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant history of alcoholism or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous history of schizophrenia, mania, or major depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe cardiac, pulmonary, vascular, metabolic, or hematologic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a cardiac pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any metallic device or implant which would contraindicate an MRI (magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging) scan of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical impairment of such severity as to adversely affect the validity of&#xD;
             psychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hostility or refusal to cooperate.&#xD;
