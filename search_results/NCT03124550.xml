  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study goal is to evaluate user experience with our developed exergame, which was designed&#xD;
      to increase physical activity, exercise self-efficacy, and social connections among&#xD;
      caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or related dementias. Participants&#xD;
      will use this garden-themed exergame for six weeks. Tailoring an exergame for caregivers of&#xD;
      AD or related dementias has the potential to increase physical activity and to improve&#xD;
      overall health and well-being in this vulnerable population, which in turn can benefit the&#xD;
      patients for whom they provide care. All study sessions be held at a location convenient to&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) caregivers providing informal care for family members&#xD;
      is rising dramatically, and supportive programs are vitally needed. Caregivers of AD patients&#xD;
      have relatively high levels of stress and depression and limited physical activity and social&#xD;
      engagement. Technology-driven programs can offer engaging, sustainable, and scalable&#xD;
      opportunities to give caregivers critically-needed supports for health and well- being. This&#xD;
      pilot study uses cognitive behavioral methods to develop an innovative social exergame to&#xD;
      increase physical and social activity among AD caregivers. Leveraging wearable activity&#xD;
      monitors, physical activity data collected throughout the day and in varied settings will&#xD;
      serve as input to the game experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers will assess the suitability of an exergame prototype with an array of features&#xD;
      including (1) instructional exercise modules, (2) activity data visualizations, (3) digital&#xD;
      rewards for physical activity that can be used to create virtual gardens, and (4)&#xD;
      opportunities to connect virtually with other caregivers to share and comment on their&#xD;
      creative products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate enjoyment of the exergame and its feasibility to&#xD;
      increase moderate and vigorous physical activity, virtual social contact, and exercise&#xD;
      self-efficacy. A group of approximately 20 caregivers will test the exergame for six weeks on&#xD;
      an Android smartphone. The findings will be used to develop larger-scale intervention studies&#xD;
      to test the efficacy of the exergame in the future. Tailoring an exergame for caregivers of&#xD;
      AD has the potential to increase physical activity and to improve overall health and&#xD;
      well-being in this vulnerable population, which in turn can benefit the Alzheimer's patients&#xD;
      for whom they provide care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be given a fitness tracker to keep after the study, a value of over&#xD;
      $100! Participants will receive $5 Amazon Gift card each week upon completion of each weekly&#xD;
      questionnaire. Participants can receive up to a $30 of Amazon Gift card upon completion of&#xD;
      weekly questionnaire.&#xD;

    <description>Caregiver's management of distress was measured with the amount of time caregivers spent on themselves doing leisure activities when they were under stress from caregiving. Answer choices ranged from never (1) to very often (4). A higher score indicated better management of distress.</description>

    <description>A modified version of Bandura's Exercise Self-Efficacy scale (Bandura, 1997) was used in the current study. This 8-item scale assesses how sure one is that they would exercise under different conditions or constraints (e.g. How sure are you that you will exercise when you are feeling down or depressed?), with answer choices ranging from not sure at all (1) to very sure (4). The 8 items are averaged to create a composite score, where a higher score indicates greater exercise self-efficacy (Neupert et al., 2009).</description>

    <description>Participants will use the exergame for 6 weeks, during which time game telemetry data (all interactions with the software) will be automatically logged by the system. The participants will be asked to use the game at least every other day. Caregivers will be sent an email or text message to remind them to use the system if they have not done so within three days. Utilizing two-way text messaging, an experience sampling protocol will be employed: once per week, participants will be sent brief questions probing their level of satisfaction with the exergame and their level of perceived connectedness to the community of other caregivers using the exergame.</description>

    <description>Fitbit Charge HR will be used to measure physical activity and sedentary behavior during waking hours. Each participant will wear a Fitbit for a period of one week at baseline and during the entire 6-week pilot study. Data on step counts, heart rate, and moderate/vigorous activity from the Fitbits will be transmitted wirelessly to our secure research server and will be used to assess changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior over the course of the study. Participants will be instructed to wear the monitor continuously on the wrist. Data will be analyzed using previously validated accelerometer count cut-points for adults after accounting for invalid data and wear time.</description>

        <title>Exercise Self-efficacy</title>
        <description>A modified version of Bandura's Exercise Self-Efficacy scale (Bandura, 1997) was used in the current study. This 8-item scale assesses how sure one is that they would exercise under different conditions or constraints (e.g. How sure are you that you will exercise when you are feeling down or depressed?), with answer choices ranging from not sure at all (1) to very sure (4). The 8 items are averaged to create a composite score, where a higher score indicates greater exercise self-efficacy (Neupert et al., 2009).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (pretest) and 6 weeks from the start of the intervention (posttest)</time_frame>
        <population>Because of participant family emergencies, one of the participant did not get to complete the posttest. Therefore, we missed the pre and post test comparison for one participant. Another participant did not fill out the pretest for the exercise self-efficacy section. Thus, we only analyzed 16 participants for exercise self-efficacy.</population>
