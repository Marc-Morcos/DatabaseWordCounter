      The main objectives for this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate novel, non-invasive ocular measurements including optical coherence&#xD;
           tomography and eye tracking in a cross-sectional study of participants with various&#xD;
           neurodegenerative dementias against standard cognitive assessments and brain imaging&#xD;
           measures; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the potential utility of ocular assessments for early detection in the&#xD;
           pre-dementia, i.e. the so-called Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage, across the&#xD;
           common neurodegenerative dementia syndromes and, Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI) due&#xD;
           to small vessel disease (SVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the prevalence and relevance of amyloid uptake on PET scanning across the&#xD;
           dementias most commonly associated with amyloidosis. Specifically we aim to examine&#xD;
           correlations with amyloid uptake status in patients symptomatic from the most common&#xD;
           proteinopathies (ie amyloid, tau, synuclein) combined in varying degrees with the most&#xD;
           common vasculopathies (ie small vessel disease) using multimodal structural and&#xD;
           functional imaging, cognitive behavioral, and gait and balance measures, taking into&#xD;
           account genetic risk markers (particularly apolipoprotein E genotypes) and fluid&#xD;
           biomarkers ( eg cytokines, oxidative stress, lipidomics).&#xD;

      1. Retinal correlations with neurodegeneration:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) pattern will differ in participants in the MCI and&#xD;
                early stages of LBD spectrum, AD, and VCI, relative to normal elders. i) RNFL&#xD;
                thinning around the optic disc and macular thinning will correlate with hippocampal&#xD;
                atrophy and with the cortical thickness signature of MCI and AD2-4. ii) If detected&#xD;
                in the other disorders, RNFL thinning will also correlate with this topographical&#xD;
                AD pattern of atrophy in those who are amyloid positive on PET. iii) Retinal and&#xD;
                cortical thinning will predict brain amyloid PET. iv) Selective peripapillary RNFL&#xD;
                thinning in the superior and inferior quadrants described in MCI/milder AD cases&#xD;
                will correlate with precuneus and lingual gyrus cortical thinning respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Retinal artery narrowing will correlate with presence of covert lacunar infarcts&#xD;
                and retinal venular widening with moderate to severe periventricular white matter&#xD;
                hyperintensities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Amyloid deposition above accepted cut-offs will vary across the 4 cohorts and when&#xD;
           present will correlate meaningfully with cognitive and behavioural patterns, including&#xD;
           ocular (retinal and eye tracking), gait and balance measures and brain imaging results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Apoelipoprotein E e4 carrier status will increase likelihood of amyloid positivity&#xD;
           across the cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Amyloid positivity will be associated with poorer short term memory performance, smaller&#xD;
           hippocampal volumes, greater cortical thinning in signature areas traditionally&#xD;
           associated with Alzheimer's disease, and also with lobar microbleed counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Small Vessel Disease burden as quantified on PD/T2 and FLAIR MRI will be associated with&#xD;
           speed of processing, attention and executive functions and with a different pattern of&#xD;
           cortical thinning involving more inferior and medial frontal regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Amyloid deposition as measured by regional standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), and&#xD;
           Small Vessel Disease burden will correlate differentially with structural imaging&#xD;
           measures, as well as both functional and structural brain connectivity measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures Overview The study procedures are listed below in the recommended order of&#xD;
      assessment but may be performed in any sequence (with specific exceptions as described).&#xD;
      Multiple assessments may be performed on the same day for participant convenience. Brain&#xD;
      imaging and neuropsychology procedures should be completed within 4 months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit Consent. The study will be explained and written informed consent for&#xD;
      participation will be obtained from the patient or his/her substitute decision maker and the&#xD;
      participant's study partner (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening. The general and disease-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      assessed. If the MMSE, MoCA, DOC (Depression, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Cognition)&#xD;
      questionnaire and/or TorCA (formally known as Behavioural Neurology Assessment - Revised&#xD;
      (BNA-R) have not been administered within the past four months, they will be administered at&#xD;
      the screening visit. Information on the patient's concomitant medications, medical, surgical,&#xD;
      ophthalmological history, family health history and other relevant history will be collected,&#xD;
      as well as information on both the patient's and the study partner's demographics. The&#xD;
      patient's corrected near visual acuity will be checked. Auditory acuity at various&#xD;
      frequencies will be assessed using an audiometer. Fasting blood will be drawn, for analysis&#xD;
      of HbA1c, CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, urea, lipid profile, glucose, liver function (AST,&#xD;
      ALT, ALP, bilirubin), homocysteine, B12 and TSH. Blood will also be drawn for genomics and&#xD;
      fluid biomarkers (see next section.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomics and Fluid Biomarkers. Fasting blood samples for genetic testing including&#xD;
      apoliprotein E4 status, as well as for proteomic, lipidomic and other fluid biomarkers of&#xD;
      neurodegeneration and vascular disease, will be collected from each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Battery and Questionnaires. The cognitive battery comprises most of the&#xD;
      tests used in the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) study, a new&#xD;
      province-wide neurodegeneration research collaboration, with some modifications. It includes&#xD;
      measures of executive function, memory, language, and visuospatial ability. Function, mood&#xD;
      and behaviour, and caregiver burden will also be assessed using the questionnaires used in&#xD;
      ONDRI. The full list of the assessment procedures is included in the BEAM neuropsychology&#xD;
      manuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SD-OCT. Assessments to meet ocular criteria will include visual acuity, intra-ocular pressure&#xD;
      (IOP) measurement and a non-mydriatic fundus camera recording, performed by a certified&#xD;
      ophthalmic technician. The participant will then undergo SD-OCT to determine retinal nerve&#xD;
      fiber layer thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital Signs and Neurological Exam. Vital signs will be measured and a neurological&#xD;
      examination will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait and Balance Assessment. Information on aid use and balance will be collected using&#xD;
      questionnaires. Participants' leg length, calf circumference, height, and weight will be&#xD;
      measured and recorded when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye Tracking. Participants will be asked to look at a computer monitor and perform three sets&#xD;
      of tasks (pro-saccade, anti-saccade, and dynamic free viewing) while a specialized camera&#xD;
      tracks and records their eye movements. Participants who are unable to complete these&#xD;
      assessments will be allowed to continue participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SV-OCT at Sunnybrook. SV-OCT will be done in subsamples with high SVD vs. minimal SVD loads.&#xD;
      A rapid (&gt;100 fps) 3D scanning protocol will be applied to SD-OCT, allowing acquisition of&#xD;
      speckle variance due to microscopic blood flow in the retinal vasculature. Image processing&#xD;
      using GPU based technique will provide real-time assessment of microvasculature morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI. 3DT1 SPGR, interleaved spin echo PD/T2 and FLAIR to assess SVD, and gradient echo images&#xD;
      to assess microbleeds, will be obtained on the 3 Tesla scanners at each of the TDRA sites.&#xD;
      The PD/T2 and FLAIR images are co-registered to the T1-weighted image to remove non-brain&#xD;
      tissues to determine total supratentorial intracranial volume to correct for head size,&#xD;
      classify brain tissue compartments and automatically identify subcortical and white matter&#xD;
      hyperintensities using a published in-house pipeline, &quot;Lesion Explorer&quot;, which with manual&#xD;
      editing yields number, size, location, and volume of the hyperintensities. For hippocampal&#xD;
      volume, we use our fully automated segmentation pipeline based on a template library&#xD;
      registration117, 118. We will also acquire DTI to generate total and regional fractional&#xD;
      anisotropy (FA) and Mean Diffusivity Maps, using FSL and DTI tool box, and a resting state&#xD;
      fMRI to explore Default Mode Network (DMN) connectivity, using a processing pipeline steps&#xD;
      previously applied to AD patients and controls119.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) will be included at certain sites which are capable of acquiring&#xD;
      this sequence, to obtain measures of regional cerebral perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amyloid PET. PIB, labelled with the positron emitting atom carbon-11, is a radiotracer that&#xD;
      targets Aβ-aggregates (β-amyloid) in vivo. β-amyloid deposits are present in the brain of&#xD;
      patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Therefore, Aβ-plaques in the brain may be a useful&#xD;
      biomarker of the disease and its progression and [11 C]-PIB may be a useful tool to detect&#xD;
      these plaques in the human living brain with PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [11 C ]-PIB is an investigational positron emitting radiopharmaceutical (PER) not yet&#xD;
      marketed in Canada. The ligand will be manufactured at CAMH PET centre. PET imaging will be&#xD;
      performed using [11 C] PIB at CAMH PET Centre with PET/CT-Discovery MI scanner using the&#xD;
      standardized acquisition protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PET imaging protocol begins with a low dose CT scan (less than 0.05 mSv) for attenuation&#xD;
      correction. Immediately following this acquisition, a bolus containing approximately 10 ± 1&#xD;
      mCi of [11 C]-PIB is administered by IV injection, followed by 90 minutes acquisition.&#xD;
      Acquisition and reconstruction of PET images are done according to the standard PET Centre&#xD;
      Imaging Protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone Check Ups: For safety measures the participants will be contacted by phone to discuss&#xD;
      any possible adverse event and general well-being two times during the course of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-72 hours after the PET scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 days (+/- 7 days) after PET Scan and/or the last study procedure&#xD;
