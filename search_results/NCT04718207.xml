  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PET/CT scans with 18F-FDG can be carried out for the detection of neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
      with hypometabolisms characteristic of the pathologies sought. The diagnosis is given by the&#xD;
      clinician after a visual analysis of the data. To complete the diagnosis, a semi-quantitative&#xD;
      analysis of the images is recommended (European recommendations) in addition to the visual&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

      PET/CT scans with 18F-FDG can be carried out for the detection of neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
      with hypometabolisms characteristic of the pathologies sought. The diagnosis is given by the&#xD;
      clinician after a visual analysis of the data. To complete the diagnosis, a semi-quantitative&#xD;
      analysis of the images is recommended (European recommendations) in addition to the visual&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET technology is improving from year to year thanks to the arrival of a new PET technology&#xD;
      called digital. In addition, correction methods have been developed to improve PET images and&#xD;
      thus improve the detection of different pathologies in PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PSF (Point Spread Function) tool enables partial volume effects to be corrected. The PSF&#xD;
      consists of correcting the impulse response of the system, and allows a visual improvement of&#xD;
      the images. Currently not recommended in brain PET/CT reconstructions, it remains to be&#xD;
      evaluated for the quantitative analysis of acquisitions.&#xD;
