  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinically characterized by the cognitive impairment and lowering of&#xD;
      various functional abilities lead to staggering costs and suffering, which are particularly&#xD;
      related to the social impacts of caring for increasingly disabled individuals. Some of these&#xD;
      changes can be almost undetectable in the early stages of the disease, worsening over time&#xD;
      often and at a varying rate of progression in different people. The traditional clinical&#xD;
      scales or questionnaires such as ADCS (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study) - ADL&#xD;
      (Activities of Daily Living) for detecting such functional disabilities are typically blunt&#xD;
      and rely on direct observation or caregiver recall. Digital technologies, particularly those&#xD;
      based on the use of smart phones, wearable and/or home-based monitoring devices, here defined&#xD;
      as 'Remote Measurement Technologies' (RMTs), provide an opportunity to change radically the&#xD;
      way in which functional assessment is undertaken in AD, RMTs have potential to obtain better&#xD;
      measurements of behavioral and biological parameters associated with individual Activities of&#xD;
      Daily Living (ADL) when compared to the current subjective scales or questionnaires.&#xD;
      Divergence from normative ADL profiles could objectively indicate the presence of incipient&#xD;
      functional impairment at the very early stages of AD. Therefore, the main hypothesis of this&#xD;
      study is that RMTs should allow the detection of impairments in functional components of ADLs&#xD;
      that occur below the detection threshold of clinical scale or questionnaires.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relevant outcome measurements for the study have been selected through the following&#xD;
      longitudinal process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of functional domains that meet one or more of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predicts conversion of MCI due to AD to mild AD dementia. Impaired in mild AD dementia.&#xD;
      Predicts functional decline in AD dementia. Reported as important by an AD dementia patient&#xD;
      advisory board. Identification of candidate RMTs to cover real-life measurement of the&#xD;
      functional domains identified in step 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of candidate digital biomarkers, which are life-log data such as steps, sleep,&#xD;
      heart rate and exercise collected by RMTs, to cover clinical measurement of the functional&#xD;
      domains identified in step 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional domains, RMTs, and clinical assessments that resulted from the selection process&#xD;
      above are listed in Table 1, and 2. The selection process described in step 1 resulted in the&#xD;
      identification of the following functional domains, sorted by relevance [HR (highly&#xD;
      relevant), R (relevant), N (neutral), and LR (least relevant)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central assumption of the study is that functional disabilities proportionally increase&#xD;
      with the progressive worsening of the AD. A recent classification proposed by the FDA 2018&#xD;
      draft guidance for the development of novel treatments in AD identifies the early disease&#xD;
      progression in 3 stages: (a) Patients with characteristic pathophysiologic changes of&#xD;
      Preclinical AD but no evidence of clinical impact (Stage 1) (b) Patients with characteristic&#xD;
      pathophysiologic changes of AD and subtle or more apparent detectable abnormalities on&#xD;
      sensitive neuropsychological measures, but no functional impairment (Stage 2), and (c)&#xD;
      Patients with characteristic pathophysiologic changes of AD and subtle or more apparent&#xD;
      detectable abnormalities on sensitive neuropsychological measures, but mild and detectable&#xD;
      functional impairment (Stage 3). The aim of the DNS study is to assess the feasibility,&#xD;
      utility and performance of selected RMTs in profiling ADL in real-world settings. This goal&#xD;
      will be achieved by evaluating digital signals collected either continuously, or daily, or&#xD;
      weekly at home, either using wearable devices or home-located ambient devices, determining as&#xD;
      much as possible the specific context-dependent conditions in which the signals are measured.&#xD;
      As a general hypothesis, RMTs will deliver more sensitive and less variable measurements when&#xD;
      compared to standard clinical assessments, questionnaires and tests measuring specific&#xD;
      functional capabilities in the clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important results of the study will be (1) the evidence that some RMT parameters&#xD;
      will provide insights for lower variance than the standard scales or questionnaires, (2) the&#xD;
      capacity of Altoida, Inc. NMI and/or RMTs to significantly differentiate the preclinical AD&#xD;
      stages 1 &amp; 2 when compared to healthy volunteers with negative AD biomarkers as a control,&#xD;
      and (3) a similar capabilities of Altoida, Inc. NMI and/or RMTs to detect monotonic change in&#xD;
      the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD group and, even more, in mild, moderate and&#xD;
      severe AD dementia groups, proportional to the specific functional impairment known to worsen&#xD;
      during the disease progression.&#xD;
