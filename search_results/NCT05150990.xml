  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to test the impact of different forms of technology (virtual&#xD;
      reality vs. video chat) on quality of life and family relationships in older adults who&#xD;
      reside in senior living communities and an adult child who lives at a distance. The study&#xD;
      will also investigate whether responses to the technology and quality of life outcomes depend&#xD;
      on older adults' level of cognitive impairment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of the clinical trial: The virtual reality (VR) program, Rendever, enables older&#xD;
      adults in senior living communities to maintain important family relationships, engage fully&#xD;
      with life, and reconnect with their past, regardless of physical location, through its&#xD;
      advanced networking and live-streaming capabilities. This project will test the immediate and&#xD;
      longer-term impact of the Rendever virtual reality platform (vs. video chat) on the quality&#xD;
      of life of residents and their adult children in an experimental design. The study will also&#xD;
      investigate whether responses to the technology and quality of life outcomes depend on older&#xD;
      adults' level of cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Participants will be older adults (age 50+) with mild cognitive impairments&#xD;
      (MCI) or mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease or related dementias (AD/ADRD) who reside in&#xD;
      senior living communities, and an adult child who lives at a distance. The resident-adult&#xD;
      child dyads (N=192 dyads) will be recruited from 12 senior living communities in the greater&#xD;
      Boston area and central California. Residents will participate from their senior living&#xD;
      community and adult children will participate from their own home, at least 45 minutes&#xD;
      driving distance away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Method: The design is a 2 (Intervention Group: Virtual Reality vs. Active&#xD;
      Control) x 2 (Level of Cognitive Impairment: MCI vs. AD/ADRD) x Time (7 time points) design.&#xD;
      Dyads will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (Virtual Reality vs. Video Chat&#xD;
      Control). Dependent variables will include positive engagement while using the technology,&#xD;
      quality of life, psychological and social well-being (loneliness, mental health, thriving,&#xD;
      and relationship quality), and caregiver guilt (guilt, stress, and burden) assessed through&#xD;
      surveys, interviews, and observational methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental intervention will be implemented in a between-group design. Dyads will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the Virtual Reality Condition or the active Control Condition&#xD;
      (video chat). Participants will complete a baseline survey (T1), followed by four activity&#xD;
      sessions once a week for 4 consecutive weeks (T2-T5). Follow-up surveys will be conducted at&#xD;
      1-month (T6) and 3-months (T7) post-intervention. Residents and adult children will also be&#xD;
      interviewed briefly after the intervention and at the each follow-up. All sessions will be&#xD;
      video and audiotaped. Computerized and human coding will examine positive engagement and&#xD;
      interpersonal dynamics while using the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyads assigned to the virtual reality (VR) condition will engage in 4 weekly VR sessions that&#xD;
      include immersive virtual adventures (e.g., bucket list travel) and reminiscence activities&#xD;
      (e.g., virtual life story). Dyads assigned to the control condition will engage in 4 weekly&#xD;
      video chat sessions. During these sessions, dyads will engage in conversations that are&#xD;
      typical in their daily lives. All other procedures will be identical in the two conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size, recruitment, and statistical power: A power analysis using simulation methods&#xD;
      (for multi-level regression models and structural equation models) was used to determine the&#xD;
      sample size. A sample size of 192 dyads (96 in each intervention condition) evenly split&#xD;
      between cognitive impairment groups (MCI vs. dementia) will achieve a high level of power for&#xD;
      detecting the minimal expected effect size. Additional dyads will be recruited to account for&#xD;
      attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Because data from parent-adult child dyads will be dependent, and&#xD;
      because the dyad is the unit of analysis for assignment to experimental conditions, the&#xD;
      analysis of quantitative data will utilize linear models designed for nested (clustered)&#xD;
      data. Hypothesis testing will be conducted with multi-level, random-effects regression and&#xD;
      multi-level structural equation modeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Determine whether virtual reality (vs. control) improves quality of life for residents&#xD;
      and their adult children who live at a distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Determine whether the positive effects of virtual reality (vs. control) on quality of&#xD;
      life depend upon residents' level of cognitive impairment (MCI vs. mild to moderate AD/ADRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: Determine whether virtual reality (vs. control) reduces caregiver guilt for adult&#xD;
      children and whether these effects depend on the adult child's own responses to the&#xD;
      technology and their parent's responses to the technology.&#xD;
