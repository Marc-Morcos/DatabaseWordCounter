  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Memory mistakes are one of the most detrimental symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In this&#xD;
      study the investigators will measure the long-term efficacy of memory strategies in patients&#xD;
      with AD. First, the efficacy of the strategies will be evaluated in the laboratory by&#xD;
      analyzing the behavioral response and the brain activity of the patients. During the first&#xD;
      visit, patients will be taught the memory strategies and asked to repeat them at home for 4&#xD;
      weeks. During this period of time, patients will perform several memory tasks while their&#xD;
      performance and brain activity will be measured using portable devices. Monitoring brain&#xD;
      activity and behavioral responses to memory tasks will provide insightful information on the&#xD;
      efficacy of the strategies and allow the investigation of how patients can maintain the&#xD;
      strategies over time. The research will examine if improving memory through the use of&#xD;
      cognitive strategies, can positively affect other domains of daily life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A crossover design with two groups will be implemented to test the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine the long-term efficacy of memory strategies in AD patients&#xD;
      using experimental memory paradigms and standard neuropsychological tests. Over the course of&#xD;
      4 weeks, performance on novel memory tasks and standard neuropsychological tests will&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of the strategies longitudinally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the neural mechanism of memory strategies in AD patients through portable&#xD;
           electroencephalogram/event-related potential (EEG/ERP) electrophysiology. Portable EEG&#xD;
           will allow us to measure the electrophysiological changes associated with the use of&#xD;
           memory strategies over time during daily life of patients with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine how memory strategies, influence the daily life and functioning of the AD&#xD;
           patients. Questionnaires on daily life activities will be administered at different&#xD;
           timepoints to determine whether patients are able to generalize the strategies to tasks&#xD;
           in their daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will investigate whether the use of combined memory strategies&#xD;
      (conservative and deep/item-specific encoding) can help improve performance in memory tasks,&#xD;
      can be maintained over time, and can be generalized to other tasks in daily life. Depending&#xD;
      on the study group, either at week 0 visit or week 2 visit, participants will be trained on&#xD;
      the two strategies. A power point presentation will be used to display one example of each of&#xD;
      the strategies and how to implement them during the tablet/Ipad tasks. At this time the&#xD;
      investigators will answer any other specific questions that might come up about the&#xD;
      strategies. Before starting the cognitive tasks at home on the app, the tablet will remind&#xD;
      participants about using the strategies, and this will also include an example how the&#xD;
      strategies should be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two memory strategies will be implemented in the described steps below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While being presented with a list of items (words or objects), participants will be asked to&#xD;
      focus on one unique characteristic of the items (item-specific encoding strategy).&#xD;
      Afterwards, another list of items, containing previously studied (old) and unstudied (new)&#xD;
      items, will be presented. Participants will be asked to recognize whether the item was&#xD;
      presented in the previous list and respond &quot;yes&quot; only if they are absolutely sure of their&#xD;
      response (conservative strategy). Participants will then be provided with a number of&#xD;
      real-world examples to practice generalizing what they have learned.&#xD;
