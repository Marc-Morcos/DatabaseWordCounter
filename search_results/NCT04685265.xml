  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and blood levels of orally&#xD;
      administered anle138b as well as the effect of food and early signs of efficacy in patients&#xD;
      with mild to moderate Parkinson´s disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose&#xD;
      study in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson´s disease. It is planned to enrol up to 5&#xD;
      cohorts. Cohorts A-C consist of up to 8 subjects. In Cohorts A and B, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive multiple ascending oral doses of anle138b or matching placebo (6&#xD;
      active investigational medicinal product [IMP], 2 placebo per cohort in cohorts A-C) for 7&#xD;
      days in a sequential escalating manner. Subjects in cohort A and B will be dosed once dialy&#xD;
      and subjects in cohort C will be dosed twice a day. Subjects in Cohorts A and B will also&#xD;
      receive an additional single oral dose of active IMP or matching placebo on Day 9 of the&#xD;
      study for an assessment of the effect of food on the PK of anle138b in PD patients. Subjects&#xD;
      in cohort D will be randomly assigned to receive QD doses of anle138b or matching placebo&#xD;
      (placebo vs 150 mg vs 300 mg; 1:1:1) for 7 days in fasted state. Subjects in Cohort E will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive QD doses of either 300 mg anle138b or matching placebo (1:1) for&#xD;
      28 days taken in the non-fasted state.&#xD;
