  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation on&#xD;
      memory and language ability in patients with two phenotypic variations of underlying&#xD;
      Alzheimer disease pathology: amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and logopenic variant&#xD;
      of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA). This study will use repetitive Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (rTMS) to stimulate nodes of networks that are thought to be affected in these&#xD;
      two conditions. Specifically, a node of the Default Mode Network (DMN)-the angular gyrus&#xD;
      (AG)-will be stimulated in aMCI patients; and a node of the language network-the posterior&#xD;
      inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG) will be stimulated in patients with lvPPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) to assess changes in functional network&#xD;
      architecture following the stimulation. We will also assess putative cognitive improvements&#xD;
      resulting from the stimulation by in-depth language testing in lvPPA patients and in-depth&#xD;
      memory testing in aMCI patients.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To investigate the feasibility of selective rTMS modulation of the Default Mode&#xD;
      Network (DMN) vs. language network in patients with aMCI and lvPPA. We will assess the&#xD;
      reliability of the rTMS/fcMRI approach to network modulation by studying the same subjects&#xD;
      over repeated sessions, with the same methodology, including appropriate sham stimulation&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: Changes in network functional connectivity following excitatory rTMS to AG (a&#xD;
      node of the DMN) and pIFG (a node of the language network) across identical stimulation&#xD;
      sessions separated in time, will show minimal within subject variability in aMCI and lvPPA&#xD;
      patients, respectively, thus confirming the reliability of the approach and the&#xD;
      reproducibility of prior findings demonstrating connectivity changes within the DMN and&#xD;
      language networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: High frequency rTMS to pIFG will reliably increase pIFG-SMG-pMTG functional&#xD;
      connectivity within the language network; high frequency rTMS to AG will reliably increase&#xD;
      functional connectivity between pIPL and HF in the DMN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1c: The changes in network functional connectivity will be selective, in that&#xD;
      stimulation to AG (in the DMN) will not modulate connectivity within the language network,&#xD;
      while stimulation to pIFG (in the language network) will not modulate DMN connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess the effects of rTMS modulation on memory and language function in patients&#xD;
      with aMCI and lvPPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a: Excitatory rTMS to the language network will be associated with improved&#xD;
      language performance in patients with lvPPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2b: Excitatory rTMS to the DMN will be associated with improved memory performance&#xD;
      in patients with aMCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2c: Cognitive improvements will persist for at least two weeks following cessation&#xD;
      of rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To identify the functional network mechanisms underlying cognitive improvement in&#xD;
      patients with aMCI and lvPPA after rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3a: Alterations in intrinsic functional connectivity (as assessed with fcMRI)&#xD;
      within each network following rTMS will correlate with improved cognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3b: Patients with a greater degree of atrophy and tau pathology within each&#xD;
      network (assessed in a prior study) at baseline will predict a lesser response to rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit up to 20 patients with aMCI and up to 20 patients with lvPPA (with amyloid&#xD;
      and tau imaging or CSF biomarkers supportive of underlying AD pathology). We will first&#xD;
      perform a baseline functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), the purpose of which will be to&#xD;
      obtain individualized network maps which can be used to target the networks of interest&#xD;
      during future sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be followed by up to two weeks of five consecutive days of stimulation (Monday&#xD;
      through Friday). aMCI patients will receive stimulation to the angular gyrus (AG) node of the&#xD;
      DMN, and lvPPA patients will receive stimulation to the posterior inferior frontal gyrus&#xD;
      (pIFG) node of the language network. During one of the two weeks stimulation will be active,&#xD;
      and during the other week stimulation will be SHAM. Order of active and SHAM stimulation&#xD;
      blocks will be counterbalanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will concomitantly assess the effects of rTMS modulation on memory and language function&#xD;
      in patients with aMCI and lvPPA, and in so doing identify the functional network mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying cognitive improvement after rTMS. Language and memory assessments will be&#xD;
      performed on days 1 (Monday) , 3 (Wednesday) and 5 (Friday) of the week. Finally, to assess&#xD;
      the distributed effects of the stimulation upon functional connectivity, fcMRI will be&#xD;
      performed on days 1 (Monday) and 5 (Friday).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate these results will lead to an impactful manuscript showing proof-of-concept&#xD;
      data: 1) that it is possible to improve memory in aMCI and language in lvPPA using rTMS&#xD;
      targeted selectively to the relevant brain network, and: 2) regarding mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      the effects of rTMS on network function.&#xD;

    <description>Active rTMS will be administered with a MagPro X100 stimulator (MagVenture, Denmark), using a 70 mm figure-of-eight liquid cooled coil capable of doing active or sham stimulation (e.g. the Cool B70 coil or the Cool B65 A/P coil). Active rTMS will be delivered at 80-120% of a patient's resting or active motor threshold. rTMS will be administered in an excitatory pattern as 20Hz. Stimulation parameters will remain well within established safety guidelines (Rossi et al. 2009).</description>

    <description>SHAM stimulation will also be administered with a MagPro X100 stimulator (MagVenture, Denmark), using a 70 mm figure-of-eight liquid cooled coil capable of doing active or sham stimulation (e.g. the Cool B70 coil or the Cool B65 A/P coil). SHAM rTMS will be delivered at 80-120% of a patient's resting or active motor threshold. SHAM stimulation will be delivered to the exact same cortical targets as active rTMS. While no electromagnetic stimulation will be delivered during SHAM, the sounds will approximate active stimulation and skin electrodes will approximate the sensation of active rTMS. Inclusion of a sham condition in this protocol is critical to measure whether or not the stimulation is improving memory or language performance, or whether practice effects or other non-specific effects are responsible for any changes in memory or language performance which may be observed.</description>
