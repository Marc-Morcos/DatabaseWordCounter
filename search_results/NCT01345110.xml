      Longitudinal observational study of cognitive functions, physical health and biological&#xD;
      parameters in the whole population living in Abbiategrasso born between 1935 and 1939,1773&#xD;
      subjects, followed for six years in order to know the prevalence and the incidence of&#xD;
      dementia and risk and protective factors of normal and pathological mental aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peculiarities of this study that must assure the outcome efficacy are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selected age: since 70-75 years old people represents a transition age from adulthood to&#xD;
           old age, it is of special interest to study the evolution of psychic and physical&#xD;
           functions of this population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whole population not a sample study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location: the small area involved (Abbiategrasso is a town of 30.000 inhabitants)can&#xD;
           contribute to guarantee more homogeneity among the subjects and reduce undesired&#xD;
           variability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  multidimensional assessment(biological, clinical, social, psychological data collected)&#xD;
           After initial screening, the recruited population will be followed up for two more times&#xD;
           (every two years )&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dementia is one of the most troubling neurodegenerative syndrome whose prevalence and&#xD;
      incidence is strongly increasing. The etiology and physiopathology of the process that causes&#xD;
      dementia are still controversial and largely unknown. So it is of paramount importance to&#xD;
      isolate risk and protection factors related to dementia syndrome and Alzheimer disease. These&#xD;
      meager known factors (biological, as well as social and neuropsychological) can be better&#xD;
      investigated through a multidimensional longitudinal study in a homogeneous population by age&#xD;
      and place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People belonging to the selected population (1773 subjects living in Abbiategrasso and born&#xD;
      between 1935 - 1939) were invited to participate at a comprehensive assessment which was&#xD;
      divided in two appointments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a first appointment (about 1 hour and half) for blood sample, social questionnaire,&#xD;
           anthropometric and walking speed evaluation ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a second one (2 hours)for clinical examination and neuropsychological assessment of mood&#xD;
           and cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment. People were recruited through several steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  involvement of the family doctor;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a general call, based on age group(1935,1936, 1937, 1938, 1939), since to be born in the&#xD;
           same year is an identity mark for these generations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  kick-off meetings for each age class explaining aims and methods of the research,&#xD;
           followed by a party with music, plays and some lotteries&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a letter with the date of the appointment followed by the phone call whenever the phone&#xD;
           number is available&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  further letters and call until either a rejection or an appointment was taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment. Professionals and instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trained interviewers, one social worker and two nurses, administer the social&#xD;
           questionnaire that is partly derived from the CERAD and from other longitudinal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trained psychologists administer a neuropsychological battery exploring mood (GDS 15&#xD;
           items), verbal and visual memory (Rey 15-item Memory Test, and the Rey-Osterrieth&#xD;
           Complex Figure Test (ROCF) recall; Babcock Story Recall Test ), executive function (&#xD;
           TMTA and TMTB; copy of ROCF), attention (Numerical Attention), abstract reasoning&#xD;
           (Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices), screening cognitive test (Clock test and MMSE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical interview and visit are executed by expert geriatricians, members of the same&#xD;
           geriatric staff who apply diagnostic criteria for dementia (DSM IV), Alzheimer disease&#xD;
           (NINCDS ADRDA diagnostic criteria); Vascular dementia (NINDS -AIREN criteria); Lewy Body&#xD;
           dementia (third report, DLB consortium); frontotemporal dementia ( 2002 modified&#xD;
           Consensus conference criteria). Other cognitive problems were classified as Mild&#xD;
           Cognitive Impairment (MCI) following Petersen's criteria or Cognitive Impairment No&#xD;
           Dementia (CIND) when cognitive impairments are in areas other than memory and they do&#xD;
           not meet whole criteria for dementia. Every diagnostic conclusion is revised by another&#xD;
           doctor; in case of discrepancies a third geriatrician, chief of the study, intervenes to&#xD;
           arbitrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the instruments were pre tested for inter rater reliability in a similar population&#xD;
      attending a geriatric day hospital, and some general agreement sessions were performed before&#xD;
      and during the screening.&#xD;
