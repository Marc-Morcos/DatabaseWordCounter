      CSF Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers are the only one that reflect both Aβ and tau&#xD;
      pathologies. There is increasing evidence for the presence of AD abnormalities in the retina&#xD;
      of AD patients. Recent studies showed that they can be detected in living patients. Thus,&#xD;
      retinal AD-linked abnormalities might be used as alternative diagnostic biomarkers for AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIREBALZ study aims at identifying and validating retinal biomarkers for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 160 patients in whom LP is indicated for assessment of CSF AD&#xD;
      biomarkers according to French health authority (HAS) recommendations. Those patients will&#xD;
      undergo a detailed neuro-ophtalmologic evaluation including retinal layers thickness&#xD;
      evaluation (optical coherence tomography).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed to test diagnostic properties of&#xD;
      retinal parameters as compared to current diagnostic criteria including CSF biomarkers and&#xD;
      logistic regression models will be used.&#xD;

      Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers are the only one that reflect&#xD;
      both Aβ and tau pathologies. There is increasing evidence for the presence of AD&#xD;
      abnormalities in the retina of AD patients. Recent studies showed that they can be detected&#xD;
      in living patients. Thus, retinal AD-linked abnormalities might be used as alternative&#xD;
      diagnostic biomarkers for AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIREBALZ study aims at identifying and validating retinal biomarkers for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 160 patients in whom lumbar puncture is indicated for assessment of&#xD;
      CSF AD biomarkers according to French health authority recommendations. All patients will be&#xD;
      recruited in the Cognitive Neurology Center (CMRR Paris Nord Ile-De-France), Paris, France.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a detailed neuro-ophtalmologic evaluation including complete&#xD;
      ophthalmologic work-up to rule out chronic retinal pathology and retinal layers thickness&#xD;
      evaluation (optical coherence tomography).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion period will be 16.5 months divided into two phases : identification First 60&#xD;
      patients then validation Further 100 patients. Study duration for participants will be 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of patients will be defined for comparison according to LP results : patients with&#xD;
      AD according to McKhann 2011 criteria and patients without AD Univariate and multivariate&#xD;
      analyses will be performed to test diagnostic properties of retinal parameters and logistic&#xD;
      regression models will be used.&#xD;
