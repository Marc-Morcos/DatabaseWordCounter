      This is an expanded access program (EAP) for eligible participants. This program is designed&#xD;
      to provide access to SUVN-502 for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. Investigator as well&#xD;
      as the subject/caregiver must decide whether the potential benefit outweighs the risk of&#xD;
      receiving an investigational therapy based on the patient's medical history and program&#xD;
      eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will not be evaluated for efficacy and safety during the expanded access.&#xD;
