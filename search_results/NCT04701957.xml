    <textblock>
      The ketogenic diet (KD) is a metabolic shift, which stimulates the liver oxidation of fatty&#xD;
      acids to produce ketone bodies. These ketone bodies represent an alternative fuel source for&#xD;
      the brain. The benefits of KD in epilepsia have been demonstrated for decades. This diet may&#xD;
      also provide benefits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) where neuronal glucose utilization declines&#xD;
      from the early stage. Besides, the KD could decrease neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and&#xD;
      enhance mitochondrial biogenesis. In murin models of AD, KD or Medium Chain Triglycerides&#xD;
      consumption were associated with lower neuroinflammation but also with a diminution of&#xD;
      neuropathologic features of AD (amyloid and tau lesions in the brain). Moreover, behavioural&#xD;
      effets and improvements in memory and motor function have been highlighted. In humans, recent&#xD;
      studies suggest cognitive benefits (memory, executive function) in AD, including in the Mild&#xD;
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage. The feasibility and the adherence to the diet proved to be&#xD;
      correct, in small samples, in particular in MCI individuals over a short follow-up period (3&#xD;
      to 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at examining the feasibility of a KD followed-up for one year in participants&#xD;
      with early AD (N=70). Change in brain metabolism will be assessed using PET scan after 12&#xD;
      months, comparing KD with control diet. The effects on cognition, quality of life and daily&#xD;
      living functioning will be analysed. The safety, nutritional changes and adhesion to the diet&#xD;
      will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;

      Research context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alongside the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the neuroinflammation triggered by&#xD;
      the central nervous system's innate immune response plays a central role in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of Alzheimer's disease (AD). ß-amyloid deposition and tau lesions are accompanied by&#xD;
      activated microglia and astrocytes. These cells release proinflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      chemokines causing chronic neuroinflammation. In turn, neuroinflammation promotes&#xD;
      neurodegeneration and ß-amyloid production. Many relationships have been demonstrated not&#xD;
      only between glucose metabolism and neuroinflammation, but also between glucose metabolism&#xD;
      and AD. Hyperglycemia promotes neuroinflammation leading to oxydative stress and&#xD;
      neurodegeneration. Insulinoresistance (e.g. in type 2 diabetes) or low IGF-1 levels are&#xD;
      associated with increased ß-amyloid production. In the absence of glucose, the brain may use&#xD;
      another fuel: ketogenic bodies (KB) produced by oxydation of fatty acids. The ketogenic diet&#xD;
      (KD) (defined by low carbohydrate intake (&lt; 10%) in AD animal models led to a slower&#xD;
      cognitive decline, decreased neuroinflammation and amyloid and tau deposition. In humans, the&#xD;
      KD is safe and is an efficient validated treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy to decrease the&#xD;
      number of seizures and to improve the cognitive development in epileptic children. In AD,&#xD;
      although KD is publicized within the community, evidence-based data regarding efficiency is&#xD;
      scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      State of art and preliminary observations: Preclinical studies: - Ketone bodies may play a&#xD;
      neuroprotective effect against beta-amyloid toxicity. In cultured hippocampal neurons of&#xD;
      rats, the direct application of the ketone ß-hydroxybutyrate in relevant concentrations&#xD;
      protects hippocampal neurons from beta-amyloid toxicity. The addition of ß-hydroxybutyrate&#xD;
      however, reversed Aß toxicity, acting instead as a growth factor that doubled the number of&#xD;
      surviving cells. - In 3xTgAD mice, a ketogenic diet suppressed beta-amyloid and tau pathology&#xD;
      in the brain; the ketogenic-fed mice also experienced superior cognitive perfomance compared&#xD;
      with control: improved memory. Likewise, in another model of AD (APP/V717I young mice), a KD&#xD;
      vs control diet was associated with lower amyloid levels. - Several other animal studies have&#xD;
      highlighted the potential clinical benefits of KD: improved visuo-spatial function in aged&#xD;
      dogs, improved motor function in amyloid and tau models of mice, in APP/PS1 knock-in mice, or&#xD;
      in old rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human studies - A clinical trial specifically assessed the feasability of a very high-fat&#xD;
      ketogenic diet in participants with AD, with a 3- month follow-up. This diet proved feasible&#xD;
      in CDR 0,5 and CDR 1 participants. Moreover, all the participants but one adapted to the diet&#xD;
      and achieved ketosis. Study completers showed significant cognitive improvement on the&#xD;
      ADAScog scale. - A couple of studies have examined the impact of KD or MCT supplementation in&#xD;
      participants affected by mild-tomoderate AD. Four of them suggested clinical benefits in&#xD;
      terms of short-term memory or visuo-spatial function, especially in those who did not have&#xD;
      any APOE-e4 allele. Nevertheless all these studies included small samples of participants (N&#xD;
      &lt; 50) and / or short follow-up (&lt; 3 months). - Recently a ketogenic drink showed promising&#xD;
      results in terms of brain energy and cognition in MCI subjects. A similar nutritional&#xD;
      intervention, in individuals with AD, was associated with improvements in cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      using PET imaging after 45 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial conducted in one memory center in Paris Region&#xD;
      (Laribosière-Fernand Widal). All the participants will be included after diagnosis of AD&#xD;
      based on comprehensive neuropsychological and clinical assessments, brain 3-Tesla MRI, FDG&#xD;
      TEP scanner and CSF biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After signing the informed consent, the participants (N=70) will be randomly assigned&#xD;
           either to the intervention group (i.e. ketogenic diet modified Atkins 2:1) or to the&#xD;
           control group (i.e. normal diet + nutritional advice)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up = 12 months with 3 clinicat visits: baseline, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 dietitian consultations in both groups (day 1, day 15, month 1, month 3, month 5,&#xD;
           month 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the visits comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ketosis measure using urinary strips&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  cognitive assessment: MMSE, CDR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  daily functioning assessment: ADSC-ADL-Pi&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  quality of life assessment: SF-36&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 12 months, the participants will undergo another brain FDG PET scanner to assess&#xD;
           change in brain metabolism. All the PET analyses will be performed by nuclear medicine&#xD;
           physicians blinded from randomization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Justification of sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of N= 35 patients per group will allow an estimate of any adherence to KD&#xD;
      larger or equal to 75% with a precision of at least ± 15%. In addition it will allow to&#xD;
      estimate the mean values of the main clinical and biological endpoints of interest with a&#xD;
      precision equal to 35% of their SD , that will allow to optimize the design and sample size&#xD;
      calculation for a next larger RCT on this topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence to diet and potential adverse effects will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
           Ketosis achievement and ketonuria related to KD will be confirmed using urinary tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the participants will be provided instructions by one study dietitians, at the 3&#xD;
           visits and in 3 additional consultations. Individuals from the intervention group will&#xD;
           be given food lists and specific recommandations about ketogenic food. Nutritional&#xD;
           advice from the National French Nutrition Programme will be given to the participants of&#xD;
           the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study protocol will be written with our Clinical Research Unit and approved by the&#xD;
           French Ethics Committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes)&#xD;
