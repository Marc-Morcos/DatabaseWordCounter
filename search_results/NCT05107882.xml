    <textblock>
      This observational, cross-sectional study is designed to validate a novel diagnostic test for&#xD;
      the detection of phenotypic changes in the retina that correlate with likely PET amyloid&#xD;
      status (negative or positive), to aid in the evaluation of adult patients with cognitive&#xD;
      impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive&#xD;
      decline. The CAS test is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations, and is indicated for use&#xD;
      with the Optina Diagnostics' MHRC (K200254).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This non-interventional, cross-sectional study is designed to validate a novel diagnostic&#xD;
      test, the Optina Diagnostics' Cerebral ß-Amyloid Status (CAS) test, for the detection of&#xD;
      phenotypic changes in the retina that correlate with likely PET amyloid status (positive or&#xD;
      negative). The CAS test is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations, and is indicated for&#xD;
      use with the Optina Diagnostics' MHRC for imaging the retina. The study objective is to&#xD;
      characterize the performance of the diagnostic CAS test in the target population of adult&#xD;
      patients fifty (50) years and older with cognitive impairment, who are being evaluated for&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline. The data generated in this&#xD;
      study will provide evidence to be used in the assessment of the benefits and risks associated&#xD;
      with use of the device in the intended population. The primary endpoint is to demonstrate&#xD;
      accuracy of the Optina Diagnostics' CAS test compared to amyloid-PET status, as determined by&#xD;
      a majority of three (3) qualified, independent PET Readers.&#xD;

        The target population for the Optina Diagnostics' CAS test is men and women 50 years and&#xD;
        older who are under clinical investigation for cognitive impairment where Alzheimer's&#xD;
        disease (AD) is one of the possible differential diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As concomitant eye pathologies or conditions could interfere with CAS algorithm,&#xD;
        individuals with certain ocular pathologies or conditions, including glaucoma, age-related&#xD;
        macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathies, and advanced cataracts, will not be included in&#xD;
        the target population at this time. Work is on-going to improve the CAS classifier&#xD;
        algorithm with the goal to include these individuals in the target population at a later&#xD;
        date.&#xD;
