      Our aim is to analyze two ancient Tamil practices (chanting and breathing exercise) if they&#xD;
      are capable of stimulating saliva containing agents that can be beneficial to the nervous&#xD;
      system. Our study subjects will perform Tamil chanting and Tamil breathing exercise. Saliva&#xD;
      will be collected before, during and after the exercises. We will quantify the specific&#xD;
      proteins in these salivary samples. The results will benefit further studies in various&#xD;
      patient populations.&#xD;

      B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE BACKGROUND Neurodegenerative Diseases Neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases such as Alzheimer's disease are a major healthcare concern globally. In the USA, AD&#xD;
      is the 6th leading cause of death. Both genetic and non-genetic factors contribute to the&#xD;
      development of AD. Individuals affected with AD require supports ranging from medications,&#xD;
      assisting devices and personal care that pose an enormous emotional and financial burden. AD&#xD;
      is associated with significant alterations at the molecular level that eventually translates&#xD;
      into cellular, tissue, organ and systemic dysfunction. Therefore, molecular therapy that&#xD;
      alters cell functions has been a major clinical option for treating AD . For example, NGF, a&#xD;
      trophic factor involved in the development, maintenance and survival of peripheral nervous&#xD;
      system and the cholinergic neurons of the central nervous system, show significant reduction&#xD;
      in AD subjects. The reduction in NGF causes significant decline in cognitive functions.&#xD;
      Therefore administration of NGF is followed as a viable clinical option for AD subjects. In&#xD;
      addition to these therapeutic options, non-pharmacological modes of treatment such as&#xD;
      meditation and yoga have been considered as alternative approaches to treat AD. Such&#xD;
      practices and life-styles are deeply rooted in several ancient cultures. This project is&#xD;
      based on two life-style health practices from the ancient Tamil culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NGF Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophic protein (MW=13 kDa). NGF is produced by every&#xD;
      tissue/organ that is innervated by sensory afferents and/or sympathetic efferents, as well as&#xD;
      by central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous system, and immune cells. NGF is important for&#xD;
      the functional integrity of cholinergic neurons in CNS and for the development and functional&#xD;
      integrity of neurons in PNS. NGF is a survival, differentiation and trophic factor for cells&#xD;
      of the immune system and epithelial origin. Salivary glands (submandibular/submaxillary)&#xD;
      produce a large amount of NGF in humans and in mice. NGF produced from mouse submaxillary&#xD;
      glands is used in several clinical trials. In CNS, NGF is produced in the cortex, the&#xD;
      hippocampus and in the pituitary gland; and also in other areas, including the basal ganglia,&#xD;
      thalamus, spinal cord and in the retina. NGF binds to its receptor TrkA and activates the&#xD;
      mitogenic MAPK, PI3K/Akt and PLC-gamma pathways to mediate cell growth, differentiation and&#xD;
      survival. NGF mediated survival is important for the basal forebrain complex (BFC)&#xD;
      cholinergic neurons. These neurons contribute to consciousness, memory, attention and&#xD;
      arousal. BFC neurons are highly affected in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. NGF&#xD;
      protects BFC neurons in experimental trauma models, and in age-associated cholinergic&#xD;
      decline. Due to the positive effects of NGF in multiple systems, development of NGF as a drug&#xD;
      is actively pursued for treating neurodegeneration, immune dysregulation, chronic&#xD;
      inflammation and autoimmune diseases. However, until recently clinical trials with NGF have&#xD;
      been without much success because of hyperalgesia. Recent studies are showing that gene&#xD;
      therapy, nasal and ocular routes of NGF administration to be effective with much less&#xD;
      nociceptive side effect. Moreover, a recent finding that chemical modification of NGF reduces&#xD;
      pain is considered as a new direction in NGF therapy. A Phase II clinical trial assessing the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of an adeno-associated virus mediated expression of NGF in the cholinergic&#xD;
      neurons of the brain is underway at MUSC involving the co-investigator of this project Dr.&#xD;
      Jacobo Mintzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NGF is taken up from the target organs by the innervating neurons and transported to axonal&#xD;
      body by retrograde axonal transport. Researchers have used quantum-dot labeled NGF to show&#xD;
      that each NGF dimer is packaged into individual endosomes during retrograde transport.&#xD;
      Retrograde axonal transport of NGF signals for the survival, differentiation, and maintenance&#xD;
      of peripheral sympathetic and sensory neurons, and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin follows a retrograde pathway to reach central neurons. Additionally, it was&#xD;
      recently confirmed that Botulinum neurotoxins A and E reach distal sites in the nervous&#xD;
      system via retrograde long range transport via motor neurons and suggested that this&#xD;
      mechanism could be common for the dissemination of other neurotrophic factors as well. This&#xD;
      might explain why intranasal application of NGF is considered effective for NGF therapy. In&#xD;
      addition, the sublingual route of absorption that bypasses gastrointestinal route is used for&#xD;
      the application of nitroglycerine and other psychoactive agents. Thus, our rationale that NGF&#xD;
      produced by the salivary glands is taken up by 1) the innervating sensory and motor neurons&#xD;
      for retrograde axonal transport to the cell body and transcytosis to reach the central&#xD;
      neurons, and 2) the sublingual absorption route into the bloodstream to reach other distal&#xD;
      target organs is well within the theoretical framework of production and transport mechanisms&#xD;
      established for neuromodulators. It is to be emphasized here that this proposal is the first&#xD;
      ever attempt to stimulate NGF by non-invasive methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chanting Chanting and singing are two ancient cultural practices in human history. Recent&#xD;
      evidence suggest that these two practices can regulate breathing. The sound symbol Om (Figure&#xD;
      2) is referred as the one-lettered key to happy living. Om is a well-known prefix in several&#xD;
      chanting throughout eastern religions. Chanting Om is believed to be associated with physical&#xD;
      and emotional well-being. Chanting Om increases the cutaneous peripheral vascular resistance,&#xD;
      which is a sign of increased mental alertness even while being physiologically relaxed. In&#xD;
      about 40% of Alzheimer's subjects, the middle latency auditory evoked potential (MLAEP) is&#xD;
      lacking. Chanting Om is shown to improve MLAEP in normal subjects after chanting suggesting&#xD;
      that a similar effect could be observed in AD subjects. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) was&#xD;
      beneficial in AD subjects as it enhances cognitive functions. Electrical pulsing for VNS&#xD;
      showed deactivation of limbic brain regions. Chanting Om also caused a similar deactivation&#xD;
      of the limbic brain regions, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, insula,&#xD;
      orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices and thalamus. The neurophysiological effects of&#xD;
      chanting Om could be mediated through the auricular branches of the vagal nerves. However, it&#xD;
      is not understood if specific molecular changes, in terms of neurotrophic factors like NGF,&#xD;
      occur after Om chanting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing Exercise Breathing exercise is an active way of regulating breathing. Common&#xD;
      breathing frequency is 15 times per minute in normal adult humans. This frequency changes&#xD;
      with age and physiological condition. In heart failure subjects Bernardi et al showed that&#xD;
      slowing down breathing to be beneficial. Exercises such as yoga, chanting and breathing&#xD;
      exercise regulate breathing and cognitive functions. One of the ancient texts referring to&#xD;
      the benefits of breathing exercise is Thirumanthiram written by the Tamil sage Thirumoolar&#xD;
      whose texts are known for health and longevity practices. Breathing exercise is believed to&#xD;
      produce cycles of oxygenation and non-oxygenation states as a means of ischemic&#xD;
      preconditioning. Remote ischemic preconditioning, i.e., inducing short periods of ischemia in&#xD;
      a remote organ provides protection from a subsequent ischemic insult. Breath-holding&#xD;
      increases vagal tone, increases parasympathetic dominance and decreases sympathetic&#xD;
      discharges. Regulated breathing leads to predominance in abdominal/diaphragmatic breathing.&#xD;
      Thus breathing exercise could be a potential way of inducing ischemic preconditioning in the&#xD;
      neurons. It is known in brain and heart that ischemic preconditioning is beneficial in&#xD;
      averting future major ischemic events by producing cell survival signaling. Interestingly NGF&#xD;
      is a cell survival signaling molecule. Therefore it is conceivable that breathing exercise&#xD;
      induces cell survival in central and peripheral nervous system cells via the actions of NGF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva as a Biomarker A normal human produces about 0.75 to 1.5 L of saliva per day. Saliva&#xD;
      contains numerous biologically active molecules including proteins, peptides, mRNA, DNA, and&#xD;
      miRNA of both human and oral microbial origin. Salivary secretion regulates the digestive,&#xD;
      nervous, immune and respiratory systems. For example, 1) Nerve growth factor (NGF), substance&#xD;
      P and calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) are secreted in saliva in response to chronic&#xD;
      migraine, and 2) Opiorphin, a potent anti-nociceptive agent is expressed in saliva. Salivary&#xD;
      proteomic and mRNA profiling have identified significant differences between control and&#xD;
      cancer subjects. These studies indicate that saliva serves as a source of biomarkers in&#xD;
      diagnosis and prognosis of a number of pathological conditions including AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE Neurodegenerative diseases such as AD constitute a major global healthcare&#xD;
      problem. Non-pharmacological and non-invasive practices could alter neurological functions in&#xD;
      normal and pathological settings. Salivary secretion of neurotrophic factors indicates that&#xD;
      saliva could be a potential source and a biomarker for neurotrophic factors. Therefore,&#xD;
      salivary NGF estimation could be a tool for diagnosis and prognosis in AD. Ancient Tamil&#xD;
      culture has preserved practices to maintain a healthy psychological and physiological status.&#xD;
      Chanting and breathing exercise are known to promote salivary secretion. However, it is not&#xD;
      fully understood if such practices induce the expression of neurological factors in the&#xD;
      saliva. We aim to quantify salivary NGF in response to chanting and breathing exercise in&#xD;
      normal human subjects. This will establish a hitherto unreported relationship between tongue&#xD;
      tactile and respiratory signals for salivary secretion of NGF, and its effects on the nervous&#xD;
      system. Our project will quantify candidate neurotrophic factor NGF in saliva at basal,&#xD;
      during and post-exercise. In future studies we will use proteomic, peptidic and genomic&#xD;
      approaches to identify other neurotrophic factors regulated in saliva by these exercises. Our&#xD;
      findings will introduce a new paradigm in the treatment and care of individuals with/prone to&#xD;
      AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and Translational Impact: Given the fact that AD, aging and other neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disorders are associated with declined neurotrophic factor production (e.g. NGF), and that&#xD;
      NGF is actively pursued as a drug in clinical trials, our findings that NGF could be&#xD;
      stimulated in situ by simple, non-invasive ethnic practices will have strong clinical&#xD;
      application. Future studies using genomic and proteomic approaches will identify additional&#xD;
      neurotrophic factors in saliva that could potentially be drug targets to treat AD and other&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. PRELIMINARY STUDIES None. D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Human Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 volunteers (male or female), aging 18 and above will be included in the study.&#xD;
      The following is a list of conditions for exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  breathing problems (inability to breath through nostrils, chronic bronchitis, emphysema&#xD;
           and asthma)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  speech problems that would prevent chanting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  inability to listen and follow exercise instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sinus congestion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sjogren's syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chronic dry mouth due to medication or other conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use of anti-cholinergic medications Informed consent will be obtained from each subject&#xD;
           after completely describing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Subject Recruitment Once we get an IRB approval, we will recruit 20 subjects required&#xD;
      for this study by posting an advertisement in MUSC elevators and in nearby Yoga centers.&#xD;
      Interested participants will contact the PI at the given telephone number. Eligibility of the&#xD;
      subjects will be assessed by the PI based on questions given in the Questionnaire. The PI and&#xD;
      the participant will agree on an appointment time. The participant will come to the PI's lab&#xD;
      at Strom Thurmond Building (STB, Room 222). This meeting room is located on the same floor as&#xD;
      the PI's research laboratory. We chose this room for its quiet atmosphere without any&#xD;
      interference by other lab personnel during the protocol. This room is reserved via the Gazes&#xD;
      Cardiac Research Institute Lab Manager, and is freely available to the PI. Upon arrival, the&#xD;
      PI will explain the study to the subject and obtain consent using the Consent Form. The PI&#xD;
      will also sign and date the Consent Form and give a copy to the participant. The subject will&#xD;
      then fill the Questionnaire to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled and consented subjects will be randomized to one of 2 conditions (the&#xD;
      &quot;Chanting/Breathing&quot; (CB) arm versus the &quot;Control&quot; arm. Randomization will be conducted in&#xD;
      collaboration with a biostatistician and will be done in a stratified manner (i.e. by&#xD;
      gender), to ensure that equal gender distribution in the 2 experimental groups (CB vs.&#xD;
      Control). The biostatistician will provide the PI with envelopes containing the study&#xD;
      identification number and random group assignment (i.e. CB vs. Control). Each envelope will&#xD;
      be opened only after study eligibility has been established and consent has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to exercise and sample collection, the PI will teach each subject how to perform&#xD;
      chanting and breathing exercise. Each subject will test individually because of ease of&#xD;
      sample collection and to avoid any variability that could arise in neuronal stimulation in&#xD;
      subjects in the presence of individuals other than the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chanting, Breathing exercise and Specimen collection The subjects will get an introduction to&#xD;
      the chanting and breathing exercise. As a chanting/yoga/breathing exercise practitioner, the&#xD;
      PI will provide this training, which should not take more than 5 minutes to learn. The plan&#xD;
      for collecting whole saliva samples is depicted in Figure 3. Salivary samples will be&#xD;
      collected once at the beginning of the protocol (Time 0) while the subjects are seated.&#xD;
      Saliva will be naturally allowed to accumulate in the oral cavity and the participant will&#xD;
      discharge it into the specimen tube (5 mL capacity) with lid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chanting Om (C):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will then chant Om as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sharp deep inhalation through nostrils&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Slow exhalation through mouth while chanting Om. At this step the subjects will perform&#xD;
           a slow and complete exhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These two steps are repeated continuously for 10 min with closed eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing Exercise (BE):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the chanting, the subjects will perform the breathing exercise as follows, as&#xD;
      instructed by the PI based on Thirumanthiram:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Check which of the two nostrils exhibit free flow of air. For the explanation purpose&#xD;
           the nostril with free flow of air is treated as Nostril 1 and the other one as Nostril&#xD;
           2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Close Nostril 2 and inhale a sharp deep breath through Nostril 1 and then close both the&#xD;
           nostrils so no inhaled air escapes. Air should not escape through mouth either. This&#xD;
           inhalation step should take about 4 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hold breath in this position for about 16 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Open Nostril 2 and exhale for about 8 seconds. Complete exhalation is required. Abdomen&#xD;
           will slowly curve-in as the subject exhales. This is normal and encouraged. No air&#xD;
           should leak through the Nostril 1 or mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Go to step a). During the exercise, if the oral cavity accumulates saliva, the subject&#xD;
           can swallow it at the end of exhalation step (Step d). The subjects will perform&#xD;
           breathing exercise for 10 min. Salivary samples will be collected at 5 and 10 minutes of&#xD;
           breathing exercise in tubes labeled BE-1, BE-2. Thus each individual will provide the&#xD;
           following five saliva samples: + (Time 0), Om chanting (C-1 and C2), and Breathing&#xD;
           Exercise (BE-1 and BE-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group In the case of control group, the subjects will sit quietly for the same&#xD;
      duration as the CB group. Saliva samples will be collected at the same time points (at 5 min&#xD;
      intervals for 20 min) as the CB group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approximate total time for the whole protocol will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction and Questionnaire - 10 minutes Instruction for chanting, breathing exercise (CB&#xD;
      group) or sit quietly (Control group) and salivary sample collection - 10 minutes (CB group)&#xD;
      or 5 minutes (Control group) Basal sample collection - 1 minute Om Chanting - 10 minutes&#xD;
      Breathing Exercise - 10 minutes Any other question by the subject - 2-3 minutes Total&#xD;
      appointment time for a subject = approximately 45 minutes (CB group) 40 minutes (Control&#xD;
      group) For the study participants' time and any inconvenience a monetary compensation will be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing of samples Place the collected saliva samples on ice. Using sterile techniques,&#xD;
      transfer the saliva to centrifuge tubes while measuring the quantity of each sample. The&#xD;
      number of samples collected from each sample at each step of the experiment could vary. Treat&#xD;
      the samples from individual tubes separately without pooling any sample. Calculate the total&#xD;
      volume of saliva during normal resting phase, during chanting and during breathing exercise.&#xD;
      Store the samples at -80 degree C until analysis. Samples will be discarded after the data&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enzyme-linked immunoassay Quantify the levels of NGF in each sample by enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunoassay using commercial kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). All&#xD;
      the reagents necessary to conduct the ELISA experiment are provided in the kit. Additional&#xD;
      reagents if any, and the ELISA reader are available to the PI at STB Room 511.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management All study data collected from participants by the PI will be entered into a&#xD;
      REDCap database, developed with assistance from the project biostatistician. REDCap (Research&#xD;
      Electronic Data Capture) is a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic&#xD;
      collection and management of research and clinical trial data available to MUSC researchers.&#xD;
      The iterative development and testing process results in a well-planned data collection&#xD;
      strategy for individual studies which facilitates data entry, edit checks and eventual&#xD;
      statistical analysis. The underlying database is hosted at the MUSC Data Center, and the&#xD;
      system is protected behind a login and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis will be done under the guidance of a&#xD;
      biostatistician, who has collaborated with the PI in developing this study. Initially,&#xD;
      descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the study participants with respect to&#xD;
      demographic, any relevant clinical characteristics, and NGF measurements at baseline and over&#xD;
      time. Group differences in demographics and other baseline variables will be examined via&#xD;
      t-tests, chi square tests, and Fisher's exact tests, as appropriate. This study is meant to&#xD;
      obtain preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of these exercises (chanting and/or&#xD;
      breathing vs. resting control) to stimulate salivary NGF; as such, no formal hypothesis&#xD;
      testing will be conducted. Instead, general linear mixed models (GLMMs) will be used to&#xD;
      obtain estimates (and their respective 95% confidence intervals) of the group differences&#xD;
      over time with respect to the NGF levels. GLMMs are ideal for analyses involving between- and&#xD;
      within-subject variability and are especially useful for repeated measures study designs such&#xD;
      as that used for this proposed study. Since age is believed to affect NGF, age will be&#xD;
      included as a covariate in all models. Linear, quadratic, and cubic effects of time will be&#xD;
      considered. Different types of error covariance structures will be examined, and Akaike&#xD;
      Information Criterion values will be used to select the most appropriate-fitting GLMM. Using&#xD;
      the GLMM will allow us to characterize the typical trajectory of NGF measurements over time&#xD;
      in both experimental conditions and will also afford us the opportunity to compare chanting&#xD;
      versus breathing exercises within the CB group. Results from this type of statistical&#xD;
      modeling will be valuable for planning (externally funded) future, larger and more definitive&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Justification Since no formal hypothesis testing will be conducted, statistical&#xD;
      power is not relevant for this proposal; thus the sample size justification is based on the&#xD;
      precision of our estimation processes and on the learning experiences involved with&#xD;
      enrolling, observing, and measuring the subjects in this study as well as conducting the&#xD;
      laboratory tests in the most efficient manner as possible. Having n=10 subjects in each&#xD;
      experimental group (for a total of n=20 subjects) will allow us to make preliminary estimates&#xD;
      of the NGF measurements over time in each group. With n=10 subjects per group, 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals around group mean estimates will extend ~0.6 standard deviations in either&#xD;
      direction, and 95% confidence intervals around mean group difference estimates will extend&#xD;
      ~0.9 standard deviations in either direction. With n=10 per group, we will also gain a&#xD;
      greater understanding of subjects' willingness to be randomized in this type of complementary&#xD;
      and alternative medicine study and of the best techniques associated with delivering the&#xD;
      chanting and breathing exercises intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Risks to the Subjects There will be 20 subjects both men and women participating in this&#xD;
           study who are in the age group of 18 and above. This protocol will consist of single&#xD;
           visit, one-on-one sessions for individual participant. These exercises do not pose any&#xD;
           physical, psychological, social risks to the participants. Breach of confidentiality&#xD;
           could be one potential risk as the Questionnaire collects health information of the&#xD;
           subjects. The participants may feel slightly uncomfortable to spit or drool in the&#xD;
           presence of another individual. There is a chance for the participant to feel that they&#xD;
           do not know the exercises beforehand or they could feel that they are not fully capable&#xD;
           of following the exercise instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Protections against Risks The instructor will try to make sure that the subjects feel at&#xD;
           ease and comfortable. All the information collected in the study will be treated with&#xD;
           confidentiality and stored in secured servers as described above. The paper works&#xD;
           generated in the present study contains potential personal information.. These documents&#xD;
           will be secured in a locked cabinet belonging to the PI located in Room 625 of STB at&#xD;
           MUSC. The participants will be identified by an identification number in all the&#xD;
           documents, data and in salivary samples. The Informed Consent is the link between the&#xD;
           participant identification number and their name. The salivary samples collected will be&#xD;
           secured at -80 degree freezer with a lock in STB Room 213 and discarded immediately&#xD;
           after the data analysis. The breathing exercises and chanting are mild exercise forms&#xD;
           and do not pose any health risks in participants. The study participants will not be&#xD;
           contacted for another study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Potential Health Benefits to the Subjects Yogic breathing in particular and yoga in&#xD;
           general are good exercises for a healthy life. Several studies indicate that yogic&#xD;
           breathing reduces stress and improves the quality of life in multiple patient groups and&#xD;
           in otherwise healthy individuals. At the end of the study, the subjects under the&#xD;
           Chanting/Breathing Exercise group could feel physically and psychologically better&#xD;
           because of the neurotrophic effects. These subjects end up learning new techniques from&#xD;
           another culture (cross-cultural experience) to regulate breathing that they can practice&#xD;
           daily at their will as continuous practice could benefit them in long run.&#xD;

    <description>Chanting Om&#xD;
Sharp deep inhalation through nostrils&#xD;
Slow exhalation through mouth while chanting Om. At this step the subjects will perform a slow and complete exhalation.&#xD;
Repeat for 10 min. During the whole period of chanting, the subjects keep their eyes closed.&#xD;
Yogic Breathing:&#xD;
Check which of the two nostrils exhibit free flow of air. For the explanation purpose the nostril with free flow of air is treated as Nostril 1 and the other one as Nostril 2.&#xD;
Close Nostril 2 and inhale a sharp deep breath through Nostril 1 and then close both the nostrils so no inhaled air escapes. Air should not escape through mouth either. This inhalation step should take about 4 seconds.&#xD;
Hold breath in this position for about 16 seconds.&#xD;
Open Nostril 2 and exhale for about 8 seconds. Complete exhalation is required. Abdomen will slowly curve-in as the subject exhales. This is normal and encouraged. No air should leak through the Nostril 1 or mouth.&#xD;
