  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia rarely get the&#xD;
      preparation or training they need to manage their caregiving responsibilities and to&#xD;
      successfully balance their own self-care and their caregiving roles. As a result, caregivers&#xD;
      often experience caregiver burden, emotional distress, and substance abuse. Therefore, there&#xD;
      is a critical need to support the emotional and social functioning of caregivers to improve&#xD;
      their health and well-being and to prevent caregiver burden and poor coping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem solving training (PST) is an evidence-based approach that teaches and empowers&#xD;
      individuals to solve emergent problems contributing to their depressive symptoms, helps&#xD;
      improve coping skills and increases self-efficacy. However, critical gaps in knowledge and&#xD;
      care remain regarding the necessary components of training (eg. How many sessions? What is&#xD;
      the influence of personal factors?) that affect how effective PST is for individual&#xD;
      caregivers. Finally, caregiver interventions have almost exclusively been tested in&#xD;
      English-speaking caregivers, further contributing to existing health disparities among&#xD;
      minority groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this critical need, Dr. Shannon Juengst, Assistant Professor of Physical Medicine&#xD;
      and Rehabilitation was awarded a new Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium&#xD;
      Collaborative Research Grant entitled, &quot;Problem Solving Training (PST) for English- and&#xD;
      Spanish-speaking Care Partners of Adults with Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's Related Dementia.&quot;&#xD;
      For this project, Dr. Juengst has assembled a strong, multidisciplinary team with Dr. Gladys&#xD;
      Maestre, Professor of Biomedical Sciences and Director of the NIA funded-Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      Resource Center for Minority and Aging Research and Memory Disorders Center at UT Rio Grande&#xD;
      Valley and Dr. Matthew Smith, Associate Professor of Environmental and Occupational Health&#xD;
      and Co-Director of the Center for Population Health and Aging at Texas A&amp;M University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will establish the necessary guidelines for an evidence-based, implementable&#xD;
      problem-solving intervention for both English- and Spanish-speaking caregivers to improve&#xD;
      their health and well-being and identify potential mechanisms of action for such training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 65 million people in the United States currently provide informal (i.e. unpaid) care to&#xD;
      an individual with a chronic illness or disability,1 including the nearly 6 million adults&#xD;
      currently living with Alzheimer's disease (AD).2 Care partners of adults with AD and related&#xD;
      dementias (AD/ADRD) often experience high caregiver burden, leading to emotional distress,&#xD;
      depression, problematic alcohol use, health problems, isolation, and poor quality of life.3,4&#xD;
      Interventions to reduce care partner stress may reverse the negative impact of caregiver&#xD;
      burden.5 The Global Impact of Dementia 2013-2050 policy brief specifically called for better&#xD;
      education and skills training for care partners. Therefore, there is a critical need to&#xD;
      provide evidence-based support to care partners so they can best manage their own lives and&#xD;
      their care recipients' chronic health conditions.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem-Solving Training (PST) is an evidence-based metacognitive strategy training approach&#xD;
      that teaches a simple, systematic method for evaluating problems, generating and selecting&#xD;
      solutions, developing specific goals and action plans, and evaluating and revising plans as&#xD;
      needed.7-18 Individuals learn to set achievable goals under the coaching of a therapist and&#xD;
      gain self-efficacy as they begin to see that the seemingly overwhelming problems are indeed&#xD;
      solvable when approached in a stepwise, rational fashion. Few care partner interventions&#xD;
      include problem-solving skills training to translate knowledge into meaningful action,&#xD;
      leaving care partners struggling to effectively manage their own lives and their caregiving&#xD;
      responsibilities. Additionally, as of 2018 Hispanic individuals make up roughly 39.6% of the&#xD;
      population of Texas,19 but most care partner intervention studies exclude Spanish-speaking&#xD;
      participants. Our team has translated and culturally adapted PST specifically for&#xD;
      Spanish-speaking care partners,20 presenting the opportunity to close a critical health&#xD;
      disparity among care partners in Texas. PST, in both English and Spanish, could be&#xD;
      incorporated across clinical settings into existing education-based care partner&#xD;
      interventions to fill the current gaps in clinical practice. PST for fcare partners may also&#xD;
      improve care recipient outcomes as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term goal is to improve the health, well-being, and participation of care partners&#xD;
      and individuals with AD/ADRD. Our multidisciplinary team has expertise in AD/ADRD and in&#xD;
      delivering and evaluating PST. The investigators represent a multi-site collaborative&#xD;
      leveraging the broader TARCC network. Our expertise and strong clinical and research&#xD;
      environments ensure the rigor, clinical relevance, and feasibility of our proposed research.&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a multi-site randomized controlled trial with a factorial&#xD;
      design of PST for care partners of adults with AD/ADRD to address the following specific&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the optimal number of Problem Solving Training (PST) sessions and boosters&#xD;
      to improve emotional symptoms and burden in English and Spanish speaking care partners of&#xD;
      adults with AD/ADRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Six PST sessions vs three sessions will be optimal for improving emotional&#xD;
      symptoms and burden of both English and Spanish speaking care partners 6 months after&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Monthly brief booster sessions vs no boosters will be optimal for improving&#xD;
      emotional symptoms and burden of both English and Spanish speaking care partners 6 months&#xD;
      after baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare a) care partner emotional symptom (depression) change and b)&#xD;
      caregiver burden change from baseline to 6-months post-baseline, to assessed long-term&#xD;
      effects of PST and booster sessions several months beyond completion of the training. The&#xD;
      investigators will also measure secondary care partner outcomes, including caregiver&#xD;
      self-efficacy, positive aspects of caregiving, and alcohol use. Finally, the investigators&#xD;
      will assess care partners' satisfaction, confidence using the PST strategy, and engagement&#xD;
      across all conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Identify factors associated with response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Response to treatment will be associated with age, gender, engagement in and&#xD;
      uptake of PST, working alliance, and goal attainment. To test this hypothesis, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess the extent to which each of these factors predicts response to PST&#xD;
      (change in outcome) using multiple linear regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing specific guidelines for an evidence-based, implementable problem-solving&#xD;
      intervention for both English and Spanish speaking care partners will result in direct&#xD;
      clinical application to improve care partner health and well-being and to improve care&#xD;
      recipient health and quality of life. The investigators will explore potential mechanisms of&#xD;
      change for future prospective study. This proposal directly aligns with the mission of TARCC&#xD;
      to take novel and innovative approaches to increase participation of diverse and underserved&#xD;
      populations, promote collaboration across TARCC institutions, and contribute to advancement&#xD;
      in therapeutic interventions to improve the lives of individuals with AD and related&#xD;
      dementias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. The investigators will conduct a randomized control trial of PST for care partners of&#xD;
      adults with AD/ADRD to assess the effects of number of sessions (3 vs 6) and brief telephone&#xD;
      booster sessions (boosters vs no boosters) on depressive symptoms (Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire-9) and caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview). The investigators will&#xD;
      recruit n=180 participants (n=45 per arm) across our two enrollment sites and conduct&#xD;
      assessments at baseline, end of intervention, and 6-months post-baseline. Booster sessions&#xD;
      will begin 1 month after completion of PST and will occur monthly thereafter up to 6-months&#xD;
      post-baseline conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Allocation. Randomization will be stratified by language and gender, then&#xD;
      will occur in blocks of 16 (i.e. 4 participants allocated to each of the 4 conditions within&#xD;
      each block). The investigators will uniformly sample (i.e. equal probability) random numbers&#xD;
      from a set containing four 1's, four 2's, four 3's, and four 4's to generate the&#xD;
      randomization table within each block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis &amp; Sample Size Determination: The investigators will conduct Bayesian&#xD;
      mixed-effect ordered logistic regression models with subject-specific random effects to&#xD;
      identify the optimal intervention group for our two primary outcomes at 6-months&#xD;
      post-baseline (Aim 1). The investigators will apply the same statistical analysis approach to&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures. The posterior probability that receiving 6-sessions decreases the&#xD;
      odds ratio of higher PHQ-9 and ZBI scores and that receiving a booster decreases the odds&#xD;
      ratio of higher PHQ-9 and ZBI scores will be reported in lieu of a p-value, which is&#xD;
      inexistent in the Bayesian paradigm. In accordance with the approach used to power the&#xD;
      current study, a significant result for any of the three treatments will be defined as a&#xD;
      posterior probability greater than 98.33% in order to achieve an overall experiment-wise&#xD;
      significance level of 5%. The investigators will apply the same statistical analysis approach&#xD;
      to secondary care partner outcomes (caregiver self-efficacy, positive aspects of caregiving,&#xD;
      coping, and alcohol use). To identify factors associated with PST response to intervention&#xD;
      (Aim 2), the investigators will conduct the following exploratory analyses. Based on the&#xD;
      PHQ-9 minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for individual change of 5 points,32 The&#xD;
      investigators will categorize participants into one of three response to intervention groups:&#xD;
      Response group (PHQ-9 score decrease by &gt;5 points from baseline to 6-months), No Change group&#xD;
      (PHQ-9 scores are within +5 points of baseline at 6-months), and Decliner group (PHQ-9 scores&#xD;
      increase by &gt;5 points at 6-months). The investigators will examine predictors of response to&#xD;
      intervention group using multinomial logistic regression. The investigators will further&#xD;
      explore predictors of change in primary and secondary outcomes from baseline to 6-months&#xD;
      post-intervention using multiple linear regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on 1,000 iterations of a simulation of our pilot data (PST to improve PHQ-9 in care&#xD;
      partners in a different clinical population14), the sample size necessary to detect a 30%&#xD;
      decrease in the odds ratio for those who received six sessions or a 30% decrease in the odds&#xD;
      ratio for those who received booster sessions with at most 5% significance level and at least&#xD;
      80% power was found to be 23 per arm (4 arms) per center (2) for a total of n=184 total&#xD;
      (n=203 accounting for 10% attrition).&#xD;
