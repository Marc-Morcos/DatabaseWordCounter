  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nighttime agitation in persons with Alzheimer's disease causes patient suffering, distresses&#xD;
      caregivers, and often results in prescriptions for harmful antipsychotics. Effective&#xD;
      treatments are lacking because of limited knowledge of the etiology of nighttime agitation.&#xD;
      The investigators propose a clinical trial to better elucidate whether a sleep disorder,&#xD;
      restless legs syndrome, may be a mechanism for nighttime agitation, and if treatment with&#xD;
      gabapentin enacarbil (HorizantÂ®) reduces nighttime agitation, improves sleep, reduces&#xD;
      restless legs syndrome behaviors, and reduces antipsychotic medications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nighttime agitation and sleep disturbance in persons with dementia (PWD) causes patient&#xD;
      suffering, may accelerate cognitive decline, leads to burdened caregivers, and is costly to&#xD;
      manage. Pharmacological interventions are primarily antipsychotics and hypnotics.&#xD;
      Effectiveness is unconvincing, and these drugs are associated with falls, strokes, and death.&#xD;
      There is a lack of tailored, effective, and sustainable treatments for nighttime agitation&#xD;
      and sleep disturbance in PWD. The investigators approach to this problem is innovative&#xD;
      because, unlike pharmacological interventions in the past, it tailors the intervention to a&#xD;
      treatable condition, restless legs syndrome (RLS), which may be causing the nighttime&#xD;
      agitation and sleep disturbance. In previous research, the investigators showed that about&#xD;
      24% of PWD have an undiagnosed sleep disorder, RLS; that RLS was associated with nighttime&#xD;
      agitation and sleep disturbance in PWD; and the investigators developed and validated an RLS&#xD;
      diagnostic and outcome measure suitable for PWD. In order for the investigators' work to&#xD;
      significantly impact standards of clinical practice, evidence is needed on whether RLS&#xD;
      behaviors cause nighttime agitation, and if treating RLS behaviors reduces or stops nighttime&#xD;
      agitation and improves sleep in PWD. The investigators have chosen gabapentin enacarbil&#xD;
      (GEn), as the RLS treatment in this research because it is FDA approved for RLS and has a&#xD;
      favorable safety profile. The investigators propose an 8-week, double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of GEn versus placebo in 156 community-dwelling&#xD;
      and long-term care facility residents with nighttime agitation, sleep disturbance, and RLS.&#xD;
      The specific aims of this pilot study are to: 1) Determine the effect of GEn, compared to&#xD;
      placebo, on nighttime agitation (primary endpoint) in PWD with RLS. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that compared to the placebo control group, the treatment group will have fewer&#xD;
      nighttime agitation behaviors. 2) Describe the safety profile of GEn compared to placebo in&#xD;
      this population. 3) Estimate the effect size of GEn compared to placebo on nighttime sleep&#xD;
      and RLS behaviors. The investigators hypothesize that compared to the placebo control group,&#xD;
      the treatment group will have better nighttime sleep and fewer RLS behaviors. 4) Explore&#xD;
      whether frequency of RLS behaviors is a causal mechanism for nighttime agitation. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that frequency of RLS behaviors will mediate the effect of GEn on&#xD;
      nighttime agitation behaviors. The results of this study and future definitive trials have&#xD;
      the potential to radically shift and drastically improve standards of clinical practice for&#xD;
      assessment and treatment of three highly prevalent, often comorbid conditions in PWD: RLS,&#xD;
      nighttime agitation, and sleep disturbance. For scientists, the results may provide insight&#xD;
      into the mechanism for nighttime agitation and sleep disturbance in PWD and inform future&#xD;
      research. For PWD, the findings may result in less nighttime agitation and discomfort from&#xD;
      RLS, improved nighttime sleep, and improved sleep may enhance daytime cognitive functioning&#xD;
      and quality of life. Application of the findings into the home setting may result in fewer&#xD;
      nursing home admissions for PWD and less caregiver burden because the PWD (and their&#xD;
      caregivers) can get more sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 Modifications - The impact of COVID-19 social distancing on the well-being of&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults with Alzheimer's disease related dementia and their family&#xD;
      caregivers who live with them is unknown. They have been confined to their homes. Social and&#xD;
      physical activities may be restricted to television and phone calls, and exposure to bright&#xD;
      outdoor light is likely infrequent or absent. Exposure to sunlight and both social and&#xD;
      physical activity are critical for healthy sleep patterns. For those with the&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptom of excessive motor activity, such as agitated pacing, being&#xD;
      restricted to the home may cause even greater suffering. In addition, family caregivers may&#xD;
      be exhausted, stressed, and burdened, even more than usual, because they have not had access&#xD;
      to support services such as adult day care, respite, and senior centers. All of the factors&#xD;
      associated with social distancing - lack of understanding of what is happening, inadequate or&#xD;
      no caregiver support services, isolation, restricted movement, insufficient sunlight, social&#xD;
      and physical activity, caregiver exhaustion, and increased caregiver burden - may adversely&#xD;
      impact the wellbeing of older adults with Alzheimer's disease related dementia. Further,&#xD;
      because older adults with dementing illness are unable to cognitively and verbally express&#xD;
      their distress, it is likely that social distancing will increase agitation behaviors, worsen&#xD;
      sleep patterns, and increase the need for antipsychotic and sedating medications to manage&#xD;
      agitation behaviors and sleep disturbances. We now examine the impact of social distancing on&#xD;
      the well-being of older adults with Alzheimer's disease related dementia and their family&#xD;
      caregivers who are living together in community settings. A sample of 30 family caregivers&#xD;
      will be recruited for qualitative phone interviews to explore the impact of social distancing&#xD;
      on the well-being of older adults with Alzheimer's disease related dementia. The specific&#xD;
      aims are to: 1) explore the impact of social distancing on nighttime agitation, sleep&#xD;
      patterns, and use of antipsychotics and other sedating medications; and 2) ask caregivers for&#xD;
      their recommendations on ways to minimize the impact of social distancing on the well-being&#xD;
      of older adults with Alzheimer's disease related dementia and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time-period where limitations are placed on in-person interactions, researchers&#xD;
      will conduct all recruitment, consent, data collection, and intervention activities with&#xD;
      participants using remote procedures rather than any procedure that would require in-person&#xD;
      interaction. After the university releases restrictions on in-person research activities,&#xD;
      researchers may resume in-person activities and/or continue optional telepresence&#xD;
      interactions.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators plan to conduct a pilot, 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of GEn versus placebo, in 136 nursing home residents with nighttime agitation, RLS, and moderate to severe Alzheimer's Disease. A placebo arm will allow for a thorough and systematic assessment of the safety of GEn in this specific patient population. A 2-month post-trial follow-up will assess whether RLS treatment is continued by providers and antipsychotics are reduced.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The pharmacy, 40 Acres Pharmacy, will maintain records of group assignment. Each participant's assignment will be kept in a separate, unique file uploaded to a UTBox (secure cloud-based file sharing platform) folder created by 40 Acres Pharmacy. Should emergency unmasking be deemed necessary, the Principal Investigator or Co-Investigator will contact the Chief Pharmacist, Forty Acres Pharmacy, who will allow view-only access to the participant's assignment file in UTBox. Participants, their legally authorized representatives and families, participants' physicians, nursing home staff, investigators, and all study personnel will be masked to group assignment. Emergency unmasking of group assignment is expected to be rare. The Data Safety and Monitoring Board will develop guidelines for emergency unmasking.</masking_description>

    <measure>Nighttime Agitation - Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) - Direct Observation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CMAI, modified for direct nighttime observation, will be used to collect objective data on nighttime agitation. Research Assistants (RAs) continuously observe the persons with dementia and record agitation behaviors every 5 minutes. The measure requires that the RAs first note whether the participant is behaviorally awake or asleep. Sleep is defined as a quiet state with eyes closed. Nighttime agitation behaviors are scored during wake. The RA will directly observe the participant when he, or she, is out of bed and record the observations using the CMAI. After the participant has gone to bed, the RA will observe him, or her, via a video camera placed in the bedroom and a small handheld monitor located in a hallway or room adjacent to the bedroom. The monitor will be shielded from view of non-research personnel when on, and turned off between 5-minute observations. The RAs will endeavor to be as sensitive as possible to the privacy of participants.</description>

    <measure>Nighttime Agitation - Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (mADCS-CGIC).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The mADCS-CGIC measures clinically meaningful change in the patient's condition relative to baseline on a 7-point Likert scale (markedly worse to markedly improved). The scale was modified to assess items specific to agitation, producing global ratings of change in agitation. This scale will be completed by the study Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) based on physical examination and interviews with nursing home caregivers and persons with dementia (if able).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Disturbance - Direct Observation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RA will continuously observe the participant in the evening and night and note every 5 minutes whether the participant is behaviorally awake or asleep. The sleep disturbance outcome will be collected at baseline and 8 weeks. Sleep and wake will be defined as percent of observations asleep or awake on Night 1, 5 pm-10 pm; and Night 2,10 pm-7am. The investigators have chosen to observe on 2 nights at different times to capture any night-to-night and time of night variability in sleep.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Disturbance - Behavioral Indicators Test - Restless Legs (BIT-RL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BIT-RL consists of two parts: 1) Behavioral Indicators - direct observations for RLS behaviors, such as kicking or rubbing legs (8 items), and 2) Clinical Indicators - medical history or family informant interview (3 items), interviews with caregivers (2 items), and an interview with the resident with dementia (1 item). The research assistants (RAs) will continuously observe each participant for RLS behaviors for 20 minutes on one evening, between 6 pm and the usual bedtime. The study APN will assess for the Restless Legs Syndrome Clinical Indicators by reviewing the medical records, and interviewing family members, evening and night shift nurses, and participants. One item, leg discomfort (yes or no) requires an answer from the participant with dementia. The APN will assess for discomfort in legs in the evening during the interval when the evening nurses report that the participant with dementia is most restless.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Disturbance - Micro-Mini MotionloggerÂ® Actigraph</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The micro-mini actigraph is wristwatch-sized accelerometer worn on the wrist. In the investigators' previous studies with over 400 nursing home residents with dementia the investigators have &quot;locked&quot; the actigraph on the participant's wrist with a plastic tie that is comfortable to wear, yet difficult to remove. The actigraph is waterproof and can be left on during showers. Nighttime total sleep time is the main actigraphy sleep outcome. The investigators also will measure other sleep disturbance variables, including nighttime wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and awakenings with the actigraph. Daytime will be defined as 7 am-7 pm, and nighttime will be defined as 7 pm- 7 am. Because the investigators have found that sleep varies in persons with dementia and multiple nights are often needed to obtain a more reliable measure, the investigators will measure sleep for 7 days and nights at baseline and 7 days and nights at 8 weeks.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Fall Risk and Cognition - Global Rating of Fall Risk (GLORF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a single question measure: &quot;How do you judge the risk that Mr. or Mrs. X will fall within 6 months - high or low?&quot; asked at baseline, week 2, and week 8 of a nurse or aide with personal knowledge of the resident. If possible, the same nurse, aide, or caregiver will complete the GLORF each week.</description>

    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE (range 0-30) is a 30-item cognitive screen measuring orientation, registration, short-term memory, attention/concentration, language and constructional capacity. The MMSE is a widely used screening test of cognition and takes about 10 minutes to administer to the person with dementia.</description>
