  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test feasibility and preliminary effects of an automated and&#xD;
      performance-based feedback app (Speeko for Elderspeak) that detects and reports the use of&#xD;
      diminutives (terms of endearment such as honey, dearie, and sweetie), prevalent elderspeak&#xD;
      terms linked to BPSD. Building on proof of concept established in the laboratory, the app&#xD;
      will demonstrate feasibility at the point-of-care. Next, a clinical trial (N= 6NHs) will be&#xD;
      conducted to test preliminary efficacy of the app for amplifying reductions in diminutives&#xD;
      use for NH staff completing the CHATO training (3 online modules).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new person is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia every 66 seconds, and&#xD;
      most persons with dementia (PWD) spend the late stages of dementia in nursing homes (NHs)&#xD;
      where lack of dementia care skills and staff shortages limit quality of care. Care of PWD in&#xD;
      NHs is complicated by behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as&#xD;
      aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as PWD lose cognitive and&#xD;
      communication abilities and cannot express their unmet physical and psychosocial needs. BPSD&#xD;
      present to NH staff as resistiveness to care (RTC) that increases staff stress and costly&#xD;
      time to complete care, often leading to staff turnover, injury, and inappropriate use of&#xD;
      psychotropic medications to control BPSD. Although Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services&#xD;
      (CMS) mandates and penalties have reduced antipsychotic medication use slightly,&#xD;
      contraindicated use in NH residents remains a pervasive problem, causing harmful side effects&#xD;
      and reducing the quality of life for PWD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI and other researchers have empirically verified that RTC occurs when NH staff use&#xD;
      elderspeak (speech similar to baby talk) that features inappropriately intimate terms of&#xD;
      endearment (diminutives such as &quot;honey&quot;), belittling pronoun substitutions that imply&#xD;
      dependence (&quot;the investigators&quot; need a bath), and harsh task-oriented commands (&quot;sit down&quot;).&#xD;
      Elderspeak conveys a message of disrespect and incompetence to residents who react with&#xD;
      withdrawal or BPSD. The R03 study established that residents with dementia are more than&#xD;
      twice as likely to exhibit BPSD (measured by coding RTC behavior in videos) when staff use&#xD;
      elderspeak instead of normal adult communication. The subsequent CHAT R01 trial verified that&#xD;
      staff reduced their use of elderspeak after attending the three-session Changing Talk (CHAT)&#xD;
      communication training program, and that this reduced RTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate dissemination, interactive online CHAT modules have been developed (CHATO)&#xD;
      which provides the same CHAT classroom content with the advantage of flexible access via the&#xD;
      internet for busy NH staff, including those in rural areas and small, independent NHs.&#xD;
      Recognizing the delay and incomplete adoption and application of evidence-based skills in&#xD;
      practice, the PI and colleagues believe additional strategies to optimize CHATO skills&#xD;
      implementation are indicated. Performance-based reinforcement of skills is effective in&#xD;
      achieving greater immediate implementation and long-term maintenance of new skills use in&#xD;
      practice. However, feasibility and costs for individualized expert feedback in NH settings&#xD;
      are usually prohibitive and thus not widely used in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test feasibility and preliminary effects of an automated and&#xD;
      performance-based feedback app that detects and reports the use of diminutives (terms of&#xD;
      endearment such as honey, dearie, and sweetie) which are prevalent elderspeak terms linked to&#xD;
      BPSD. The PI and colleagues developed the SPEEKO for Elderspeak app using archived NH&#xD;
      recordings from previous research to identify the most commonly used diminutives and then to&#xD;
      develop algorithms to detect them in speech. Building on proof of concept established in the&#xD;
      laboratory, the app will demonstrate feasibility at the point-of-care. Next, a clinical trial&#xD;
      (N= 6NHs) will be conducted to test preliminary efficacy of the app for amplifying reductions&#xD;
      in diminutives use for NH staff completing the CHATO training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AIM 1. Demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and validity of the SPEEKO for Elderspeak&#xD;
           feedback app use by staff in the NH. Five certified nursing assistants (CNAs) will use&#xD;
           the app during NH care and provide feedback about any needed modifications. Hypothesis:&#xD;
           The app will be readily used and acceptable to CNAs. Diminutive counts determined by the&#xD;
           app will be correlated with psycholinguistic analysis, validating accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AIM 2. Test preliminary effects of an innovative self-monitoring feedback app on staff&#xD;
           elderspeak use and compare accuracy to psycholinguistic analyses of audio-recorded staff&#xD;
           communication. Hypothesis: Staff who receive immediate app feedback (N= 30 in three NHs)&#xD;
           will have greater elderspeak reduction after completing CHATO training compared to&#xD;
           delayed feedback controls (N= 30 in three NHs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. AIM 3. Evaluate app acceptability and costs. Hypothesis: Staff who use the app will find&#xD;
           it acceptable and beneficial for their practice. Process-based costing will be used to&#xD;
           determine costs for app use in NHs and other long-term service and support settings.&#xD;
           Costs will be compared in relation to each group's outcomes.&#xD;
