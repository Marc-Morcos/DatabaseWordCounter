  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders such as early Alzheimer's disease (AD) or primary&#xD;
      progressive aphasia (PPA) is particularly difficult and constantly evolving, often leading to&#xD;
      diagnostic erraticity. However, several studies have shown that graphic parameters are&#xD;
      affected in people with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. The use of new technologies&#xD;
      in the study and analysis of the abilities of people with neurodegenerative diseases is&#xD;
      increasingly recommended. The use of a digital tablet with a stylus makes it possible to&#xD;
      objectivize the kinematic parameters of writing (pressure, inclination, speed, jerk, time of&#xD;
      writing task) and thus would allow a low-cost diffusion of this technology in particular by&#xD;
      including it in already existing screening batteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the project is to characterize and compare the graphical markers of&#xD;
      a writing task, either language-based (writing words, non-words, sentences) or&#xD;
      non-language-based (drawing shapes), in patients with PPA, early-stage Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (i.e., at the stage of minor neurocognitive disorders and major neurocognitive disorders at&#xD;
      the beginning of the disease), and in people with no cognitive disorders.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the difference in writing pressure averages collected between the language and non-language tasks in the three groups of interest.&#xD;
It will be assessed using DTLA screening battery (Macoir et al., 2017) to which writing tasks will be added.</description>

    <measure>Socio-demographic characteristics</measure>

    <description>Participants will be asked their date of birth, sex, gender, lateralization (right-handed, left-handed or ambidextrous), level of education, born in Canada or elsewhere, number of years on Canadian soil, place of living (individual residence, RPP, other), presence of a natural caregiver.</description>

    <measure>Stage of the neurodegenerative disease</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Stage of the neurodegenerative disease will be assessed by using the MMSE test.&#xD;
Furthermore, participants will be asked the number of medications taken per day, the use of psychotropic medications (antidepressants, anxiolytics, neuroleptics) and the use of an antidementia treatment.</description>

    <description>The study consists of a single physical visit to the research team's site.&#xD;
Participants will take a graphic task included in a validated test for language impairment in adults and older adults (DTLA). This test with writing data has a maximum completion time of 15 minutes. Diagnostic data will be collected from the patient's chart, frailty data and socio-demographic data will be collected by self-questionnaires.&#xD;
Participants will be evaluated by the principal investigator or his or her representatives from the research team.</description>
