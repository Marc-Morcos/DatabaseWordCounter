  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the value of Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI, a&#xD;
      measure of blood flow to the brain, in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and compare it to&#xD;
      existing measures. In particular, the investigators will compare ASL MRI to Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography (PET/CT), which measures brain metabolism reflecting how well cells in a patient's&#xD;
      brain are functioning. In addition, the investigators will assess the relationship of these&#xD;
      measures to specific protein levels associated with Alzheimer's Disease in the patient's&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) obtained by lumbar&#xD;
      puncture. By comparing the information that is available from these procedures to the&#xD;
      patient's performance on cognitive tests, the investigators hope to learn which procedures&#xD;
      most accurately reflect and assist in determination of the potential causes of cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties that arise with MCI, and thus, which are most useful in the clinical setting. In&#xD;
      particular, PET scans have been found to be very useful in diagnosis of MCI and Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease, but the investigators want to find out if they can get the same, or better,&#xD;
      information from an ASL MRI scan, which is less expensive and easier to acquire.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary aim is to determine if the diagnostic accuracy of 'state-of-the art' Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI is as good as (i.e., noninferior to) the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET/CT in comparison of MCI patients to cognitively normal adults. To test if ASL in noninferior to FDG-PET, we will use an asymptotic z test statistic for equivalent studies described in an equation of Zhou et al. (2002). The test statistic compares the AUCs from ASL and FDG-PET/CT by appropriately accounting for the correlation between them.</description>

    <measure>Prediction of longitudinal change in hippocampal volume</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will compare ASL MRI versus FDG PET in their ability to predict disease progression based on change in hippocampal volume. Investigators will define patients as 'progressors' if they display an atrophy rate greater than one standard deviation above the mean rate for healthy controls. Investigators will again use the composite ROI for ASL sequences and FDG-PET data to determine the best single or combination of predictors of progression.</description>

    <description>Investigators will compare ASL MRI versus FDG PET in their ability to predict disease progression based on conversion to clinical Alzheimer's Disease. Investigators will determine which measure best predicts conversion to clinical Alzheimer's Disease.</description>

        This project will focus on a population enriched in individuals with incipient AD (i.e.&#xD;
        MCI). These subjects, as well as age-matched controls, will be recruited from the&#xD;
        Alzheimer's Disease Center at the University of Pennsylania.&#xD;
