    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to improve communication among clinicians, patients with&#xD;
      memory problems, and their family members. We are testing a way to help clinicians have&#xD;
      better conversations to address patients' goals for their healthcare. To do this, we created&#xD;
      a simple, short guide called the &quot;Jumpstart Guide.&quot; The goal of this research study is to&#xD;
      show that using this kind of guide is possible and can be helpful for patients and their&#xD;
      families. Patients' clinicians may receive a Jumpstart Guide before the patient's clinic&#xD;
      visit. Researchers will compare patients whose clinician received a Jumpstart Guide to&#xD;
      patients whose clinician did not receive a guide to see if more patients in the Jumpstart&#xD;
      Guide group had conversations about the patient's goals for their healthcare. Patients and&#xD;
      their family members will also be asked to complete surveys after the visit with their&#xD;
      clinician.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an NIH Stage III hybrid efficacy-effectiveness trial that also capitalizes on&#xD;
      insights from the hybrid effectiveness-implementation design. This is a parallel group&#xD;
      randomized trial randomizing patients with ADRD to Jumpstart or usual care. Jumpstart is&#xD;
      designed to promote and guide goals-of-care discussions for patients with serious illness&#xD;
      through suggestions and &quot;tips&quot; on the Jumpstart Guide. The guide also includes&#xD;
      patient-specific information gathered from the EHR on the presence of advance directives and&#xD;
      POLST forms. This trial is also pragmatic because we will enroll all eligible patients;&#xD;
      Jumpstart guides will be delivered to clinicians caring for all patients in the intervention&#xD;
      arm. Patient-reported outcomes will only be collected from patients and families willing to&#xD;
      complete surveys. The primary outcome, EHR documentation of goals-of-care discussions, will&#xD;
      be collected for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 4 steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1. Patient Identification and randomization. Patients are randomized at the time of&#xD;
      confirmation of eligibility to one of two study arms: the Jumpstart intervention or usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jumpstart is a communication-priming intervention for clinicians, patients and their families&#xD;
      in the outpatient setting. The intervention's goal is to prompt clinicians to provide, during&#xD;
      a scheduled (non-urgent) clinic visit, standard of care which includes a discussion with&#xD;
      patients (and/or their LNOKs) about their goals of care. It is designed to promote and guide&#xD;
      these discussions for older adults with ADRD through suggestions and tips on the Jumpstart&#xD;
      guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2. Creation of EHR-based Jumpstart Guide. For patients randomized to intervention, a&#xD;
      &quot;clinician-facing&quot; Jumpstart guide is created. The Jumpstart guide is developed from EHR&#xD;
      data, using automated retrieval routines to summarize the presence or absence of Physician&#xD;
      Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST), advance directives, and durable power of&#xD;
      attorney (DPOA) for health care documentation. This information is used to populate the&#xD;
      Jumpstart guide with tailored recommendations to clinicians for initiating or continuing&#xD;
      goals of care discussions at the patient's upcoming &quot;target visit&quot; appointment. No Jumpstart&#xD;
      guides are created for patients in the comparator arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3. Delivery of Jumpstart Guide to Clinician. Jumpstart guides are delivered within 1-2&#xD;
      days prior to the patient's targeted appointment via secure email or in person to the&#xD;
      clinician who is caring for the study patient in the outpatient setting. Study staff monitors&#xD;
      the EHR via EPIC to confirm appointment attendance, or to revise the target visit date if the&#xD;
      appointment is rescheduled. The study does not contact clinicians for patients in the&#xD;
      comparator arm; however, the target visit is tracked and logged in order to collect outcome&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4. Recruitment of Patients and Family Members for Surveys. At approximately 2 weeks&#xD;
      after the target visit, patients are contacted to participate in survey activities.&#xD;
      Recruitment is as noted above. Surveys are distributed to patients and family members in both&#xD;
      study arms at 1-, 3-, and 12-months after a target visit. These time points are designed to&#xD;
      maximize subjects' ability to recall occurrence of a goals-of-care discussion (1-month) while&#xD;
      also allowing time for the communication intervention to impact care plans and other&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes (3- and 12-months). Surveys assess patient outcomes, including&#xD;
      palliative care needs, healthcare utilization and intensity of care, and psychological&#xD;
      symptoms. Family surveys include items that allow the family to assess the patient outcomes&#xD;
      from the caregiver's perspective as well as caregiver outcomes. Surveys may be completed&#xD;
      in-person, online (REDCap), or by phone, based on subjects' preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A legal next of kin is identified for all patients in case patients are unable to complete&#xD;
      surveys at any time during their 12-month period of study participation. We use the same&#xD;
      procedures for them at later time points that are used at initial recruitment and enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Interviews. At the end of the participants' follow-up period, intervention&#xD;
      patients and family members are invited to take part in a short, semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      to evaluate the intervention. The interviews will last about 20-30 minutes. This subset of&#xD;
      subjects is contacted by the study team by mail, email, telephone or in-person, based on&#xD;
      their preference determined at enrollment. We use purposive sampling to select individuals&#xD;
      representing diverse demographics (i.e., age, gender, race, ethnicity, dementia severity) and&#xD;
      various levels of participation in the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians are identified by the study team using purposive sampling to identify those who&#xD;
      participated fully in the intervention component and those who were sent the Jumpstart guide&#xD;
      but did not document a goals-of-care discussion. They are also selected using purposive&#xD;
      sampling to ensure a diverse group based on race/ethnicity, age, gender, specialty, and years&#xD;
      of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews explore feedback on the intervention and ways to improve intervention delivery and&#xD;
      implementation, including three key implementation outcomes (acceptability, fidelity,&#xD;
      penetration) that will guide future dissemination of the intervention. They are conducted in&#xD;
      person, by video conference, or by phone, depending on the participant's preference.&#xD;
      Interviews are audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. To ensure&#xD;
      trustworthiness and accuracy, interviewers (research coordinators) may perform a &quot;member&#xD;
      check&quot; of the results with participants selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Data Collection: We use EHR-based quality metrics program to obtain data about&#xD;
      patients from the EHR, including those data required for screening and for primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes. (See below.) We collect these data using our automated and validated&#xD;
      methods within UW Medicine from the EHR using UW Medicine's Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW),&#xD;
      a repository of data from multiple sources including clinical, supply chain, billing, and&#xD;
      human resources. We collect healthcare utilization outside of UW Medicine through participant&#xD;
      surveys, along with occurrence and place of death (if death occurs within 24 months from&#xD;
      patient enrollment) from the EHR and Washington State death certificate data.&#xD;
