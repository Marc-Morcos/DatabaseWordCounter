      The hypothesis is that the differential extent of microstructural damages in the affected&#xD;
      brain regions can be specific to the disease of interest and could reflect the clinical&#xD;
      severity. Therefore, the investigator propose that whole brain parcellation of diffusion MRI&#xD;
      can be used to improve diagnosis and prediction of clinical outcomes in Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A regression model between clinical severity and two year clinical outcomes and&#xD;
           diffusion properties from multiple parcellated regions will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blind validation will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are diagnosed mainly by&#xD;
      neurologists, based on clinical symptoms. However, there are no objective criteria available&#xD;
      for their diagnosis. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often employed in&#xD;
      conjunction with clinical judgement, the images are mostly used to eliminate other diseases,&#xD;
      rather than to confirm the diagnosis. Other imaging methods, such as Position Emission&#xD;
      Tomography or Computed Tomography, may help in the diagnosis of AD and PD, but have harmful&#xD;
      effects on the human body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion MRI, and in particular Diffusion Tensor Imaging, are often employed in the&#xD;
      evaluation of changes in connectivity in the central nervous system. As it is non-invasive&#xD;
      and does not involve radiation, diffusion MRI is suitable to be used for longitudinal&#xD;
      studies. It has been used for the evaluation of fiber density and cross-section in many&#xD;
      diseases, including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumours, with good results.&#xD;
      Several measurements can be obtained from diffusion MRI, including fractional anisotropy and&#xD;
      mean, radial and axial diffusivity. Changes observed in diffusion MRI are related to changes&#xD;
      in water content inside and outside of cells, so an increase in the diffusion coefficient&#xD;
      could reflect an increase in cell membrane permeability, which may be attributed to cell&#xD;
      death and rupturing. A higher diffusion coefficient may be indicative of more neuronal death.&#xD;
      Therefore, using diffusion kurtosis, the investigator may be able to improve diagnoses of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From research on AD, the investigator found that the diffusion coefficient of patients with&#xD;
      mild cognitive impairment and AD is significantly higher than control patients. The&#xD;
      investigator will carry out analysis on 90 brain regions, including the fusiform gyrus,&#xD;
      hippocampus, parahippocampus and cingulum. The listed regions have been observed to have&#xD;
      differences in mean diffusivity for AD patients and those at risk for AD, as compared to&#xD;
      normal controls. In previous studies, overlaps were observed between areas where the mean&#xD;
      diffusivity increases and areas where brain regions shrink, but there are more regions and&#xD;
      larger areas where the diffusion coefficient increases. Therefore, the mean diffusivity may&#xD;
      be a more suitable clinical index than the current method of brain volume. In addition, there&#xD;
      is a correlation between increased mean diffusivity and the severity of mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment or AD. Amyloid deposition is consistent with disease progression, further&#xD;
      supporting that mean diffusivity can be used to reflect the progression of mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator plan to use Compressed Sensing to increase the speed of diffusion MRI. This&#xD;
      includes image preprocessing, acquisition of Compressed Sensing observations, rebuilding the&#xD;
      model, and reconstructing the algorithm. The investigator also plan to overcome the current&#xD;
      limitations of region-of-interest analysis. One way of achieving this is by voxelwise&#xD;
      analysis, however it has limitations caused by normalization of the image to a template&#xD;
      space, and possible problems in tractography caused by rotation or distortion of the image.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the use of a study specific template prevents the results from being available&#xD;
      in Brodmann or Talairach coordinates. Most importantly, voxel analysis is not based on brain&#xD;
      regions, so it is difficult to determine the properties of each region, and according to our&#xD;
      algorithm, a large amount of voxel data would greatly reduce the resolution of the statistics&#xD;
      and cause problems in statistical analysis. Therefore, the investigator have to use a common&#xD;
      standard space, and develop a suitable imaging technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator choose to use Automatic Anatomical Labelling (AAL), as this is a commonly&#xD;
      used system used in neuroscience research. The investigator also use the Montreal&#xD;
      Neuroscience Institute 152 Template (MNI152) as out standard template. In the imaging and&#xD;
      processing of the whole brain, the investigator use Affine Transformation, as this is&#xD;
      commonly used for MRI and diffusion MRI. This includes Camino, FSL, and SPM. The investigator&#xD;
      will study how the aging of a healthy brain changes the diffusion MRI and make comparisons&#xD;
      between aging in males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will also use Deep Learning to increase the sensitivity and specificity and&#xD;
      to improve the accuracy of classification and diagnosis, by data set sample allocation data&#xD;
      preprocessing, and deep neural network design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using AAL, whole brain parcellation will be performed to obtain diffusion MRI information of&#xD;
      regions in the brain. Affected regions will be identified and analysed. The investigator hope&#xD;
      that diffusion MRI using whole brain regions can be used for differential diagnosis and for&#xD;
      identifying regions that have high correlation with clinical severity, and for accurate&#xD;
      disease diagnosis and prognosis, to serve as a reference for clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator aim to use diffusion MRI to assess cognitive function and evaluate if it&#xD;
      deteriorates in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the investigator hope&#xD;
      to use diffusion MRI to determine the disease severity and prognosis. Worsening of&#xD;
      neurodegeneration and cognitive ability brings about increased mortality and poorer quality&#xD;
      of life. The relationship between diffusion MRI results and disease severity may provide an&#xD;
      objective method allowing clinicians to diagnose these diseases with greater confidence and&#xD;
      earlier on in disease onset, before the worsening of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be completed in three phases, over three years. In the first year, the&#xD;
      investigator hope to establish an optimal high-quality imaging compression sensing scheme and&#xD;
      image data restoration process for diffusion MRI. The investigator also hope to develop an&#xD;
      optimal method for brain parcellation, and to use deep learning to improve diagnosis of&#xD;
      patients with mild cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second year, the investigator hope to establish a process for predicting the prognosis&#xD;
      of patients with typical and atypical PD, using deep learning. The investigator also hope to&#xD;
      complete our evaluation of using deep learning for the diagnosis of mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third year, the investigator aim to complete the development of a method for&#xD;
      predicting the prognosis of patients with typical and atypical PD. The investigator will also&#xD;
      establish and complete our method of using deep learning to evaluate if patients with mild&#xD;
      cognitive development will develop AD. Furthermore, the investigator will complete the user&#xD;
      interface for image processing.&#xD;
