      This study is designed to help improve the care of sexual and gender minority (SGM) with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementia (AD/ADRD) in long-term services&#xD;
      and supports (LTSS) by training the state's LTSS workforce in SGM culturally responsive care.&#xD;
      The randomized controlled trial will rigorously test the effects of an in person versus an&#xD;
      online training program on improving SGM culturally responsive care with a waitlist control.&#xD;

    <description>Participants are provided access to the pretest one week before the training. On the day of training, when the trainers arrive, participants have a final opportunity to complete the baseline survey before the intervention. Tablets will be available to complete pre- and post- surveys. The training for management takes 3-4 hours, and for staff, one hour. For consistency and feasibility, both trainings are conducted by the same trainers at the same visit. Immediately after the intervention, participants complete the post-intervention seminar evaluation assessing knowledge and attitudes/comfort in serving SGM clients.</description>

    <description>Participants are provided a unique identifier to access the online website. The opening page welcomes them to the study, then directs them to the chunked consent materials and baseline survey. As soon as they have completed this, they receive access to the intervention, which for management is expected to take 1-2 hours and for staff, 30-45 minutes (i.e., the online equivalent of 3-4 and 1 hour, respectively). After completion of the required modules, participants receive access to the optional modules as well as the posttest survey to evaluate the training. Once the post-test is complete, they are thanked for their involvement and informed they will receive an e-mail to access a follow-up survey in six months' time.</description>
