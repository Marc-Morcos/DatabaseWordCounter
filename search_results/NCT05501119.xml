    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is pilot test a nurse led intervention previously used in&#xD;
      patients with pulmonary fibrosis and their caregivers in a new population (persons living&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. The researchers hypothesize improving advanced&#xD;
      care planning in this population will result in enhanced quality of life over illness&#xD;
      trajectory and improve safety for community dwelling PWD/CG dyads. Findings from this study&#xD;
      will inform additional necessary adaptations required prior to conducting larger scale&#xD;
      powered randomized control trial.&#xD;

    <description>The SUPPORT-D intervention consists educational materials will be presented in a format with enhanced content (face-to-face virtually delivered by nurse interventionist via telehealth (e.g., MS Teams), with printed booklet, and identical digital content (electronic pdf and recorded videos of printed content). The SUPPORT-D intervention will be addressed in four sequential sections including: 1) understanding the disease 2) caring for myself; 3) information for the caregiver; and 4) planning for the future. Within the four sections of the intervention seven topics are addressed included symptom management, understanding your disease, putting safety first, ongoing conversations, respite care, palliative care, and alternative treatments. Participants will attend a total of 4 study visits across 8 weeks (approximately every 2 weeks).</description>
