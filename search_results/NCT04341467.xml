  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, olanzapine is the most widely used and studied drug for the treatment of&#xD;
      behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but there are&#xD;
      significant side effects. Amisulpride is a new antipsychotic that not only controls mental&#xD;
      symptoms but also improves cognitive function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of both amisulpride and Olanzapine for treating&#xD;
      the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in patients with dementia of the&#xD;
      Alzheimer type.&#xD;
