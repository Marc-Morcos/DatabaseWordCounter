  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this cohort study is to estimate the incidence of AD in the first-degree&#xD;
      relatives of patients with AD. The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cognitive changes of subjects at high risk of AD as ageing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  environmental and behavioral factors affecting AD incidence.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective cohort study focusing on the first-degree relatives of patients&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multiple methods including the neuropsychiatric assessment&#xD;
      battery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluid biomarkers (blood and urine) are used to&#xD;
      estimate the longitudinal changes of the participants at high risk of AD. Besides, a&#xD;
      structured questionnaire is designed to investigate how environmental, behavioral and other&#xD;
      factors influence the incidence of AD. This study is of great significance in establishing&#xD;
      novel guidelines for the prevention and treatment of dementia suitable for Chinese&#xD;
      population, and for clinicians to predict the risk of AD in first-degree relatives.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of cognitive impairment at 5 years</measure>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at 5 years</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>MMSE is a brief screening instrument used to assess cognitive function (orientation, memory, attention, ability to name objects, follow verbal/written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures) in elderly participants. Total score ranges from 0 to 30; lower score indicates greater disease severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) at 5 years</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>AVLT is a screening instrument used to assess the function of memory. The score in long-term memory (N5) ranges from 0 to 12, with lower scores indicating greater disease severity.</description>

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>AVLT is a screening instrument used to assess the executive function. Time consumed is recorded as the result, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) at 5 years</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>GDS is a neuropsychological scale used to assess the level of depression. The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From multi-modal MRI neuroimaging at 5 years</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of multimodal MRI, including high-resolution structural T1 imaging, functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Blood concentration of Phosphorylated Tau (p-tau) at 5 years</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Blood p-tau 181 and p-tau 217 at baseline will be tested. The higher blood p-tau is a strong predictor for AD.</description>

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Blood Aβ40 and Aβ42 at baseline will be tested. The decreased blood Aβ42/40 ratio is a strong predictor for AD.</description>
