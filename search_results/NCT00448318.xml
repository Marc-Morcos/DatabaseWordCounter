    <textblock>
      Dementing syndromes are, for the most part, incurable. People with dementia become highly&#xD;
      dependent and frequently have to move from their homes into residential aged care facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications aimed at reducing the severity of a number of symptoms associated with the&#xD;
      different types of dementia have had only modest success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasingly, people with dementia, their families and carers are turning to supplementary or&#xD;
      alternative approaches to the management of their symptoms. There are many published reports&#xD;
      describing the successful use of music therapy in reducing the severity of many symptoms of&#xD;
      dementia. These include reports of improved memory, improved language skills, reduced anxiety&#xD;
      and depression, reductions in agitation and disruptive behaviours and better social&#xD;
      relationships with family, peers and carers. However, the quality of evidence they provide&#xD;
      for the most part fails meet the standards of evidence required by health care providers.&#xD;
      This clinical trial will examine the effects of a music therapy intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 180 patients in sub-acute hospital wards. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly placed in groups that receive either occupational therapy or music therapy. Before&#xD;
      the therapy programs begin, we will use questionnaires to measure memory function, language&#xD;
      ability, orientation and mood. We will also record brain activity from the surface of the&#xD;
      scalp, blood pressure and pulse to examine physiological responses. The same measures will be&#xD;
      repeated after the 3 weeks of therapy to determine whether there has been any improvement in&#xD;
      the symptoms of the participants and whether the group that had music therapy showed greater&#xD;
      improvement than the group that had occupational therapy. We will make a video recording&#xD;
      during one therapy session to allow us to observe levels of engagement and to assess changes&#xD;
      in facial expressions. This will provide information about the immediate effects of music on&#xD;
      mood and social interaction. The information we collect about brain activity and blood&#xD;
      pressure will help us to understand how music therapy might bring about changes in the&#xD;
      symptoms of dementia. This understanding will be useful in developing better applications of&#xD;
      music therapy. It will also add to our current knowledge about how the various diseases cause&#xD;
      the problems they do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the primary aim of the project is to determine whether the reported effects of&#xD;
      music therapy are supported by objective evidence.&#xD;

      RATIONALE: Dementia presents a significant health problem throughout the world. We will&#xD;
      compare the effects of a music therapy intervention and an occupational therapy intervention&#xD;
      in a randomised controlled trial conducted with hospitalised older people with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will employ physiological, psychometric and observer-rated measures to monitor&#xD;
      change over time in a range of parameters including cognitive and behavioural responses, mood&#xD;
      and agitation, CNS function, facial expression and blood pressure. The battery of&#xD;
      psychometric instruments consists of well-validated and reliable measures. Cognitive status&#xD;
      will be measured using The Mini-Mental State Exam (Folstein et al, 1975) and the Hierarchic&#xD;
      Dementia Scale (Cole and Dastoor, 1996) Mood will be assessed using the Geriatric Depression&#xD;
      Scale (Yesavage et al., 1983). A wide range of behaviours will be assessed with the&#xD;
      Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) (Cohen-Mansfield, J., 1986). To monitor changes&#xD;
      related to the music and non-music interventions, we will employ the EEG methods that will&#xD;
      detect changes in dementia-related generalised, global slowing of the EEG as well as more&#xD;
      localised changes at sites in anterior and posterior regions of both cerebral hemispheres.&#xD;
      EEG-coherence methods will be used to assess intrahemispheric and interhemispheric functional&#xD;
      interactions. We will also record auditory evoked potentials to evaluate changes in the&#xD;
      attentional status of participants. This will provide data that will detect change over time&#xD;
      in response to the interventions. The Facial Activation Coding System (Ekman &amp; Friesen, 1978)&#xD;
      allows systematic analysis of facial expressions from video-taped recordings. It has been&#xD;
      used with people with dementia to provide valid and reliable quantitative estimates of pain&#xD;
      states (Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2000). It will be employed here to quantitatively evaluate&#xD;
      changes in facial expression that occur during the intervention sessions. This will allow us&#xD;
      to observe within group changes and between group differences in the range of expressive&#xD;
      responses. Changes in blood pressure will provide a means of evaluating physiological&#xD;
      responses to the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS: The primary aim of the present study is to determine whether the symptomatic&#xD;
      improvements attributed to music therapy are supported by empirical evidence derived from a&#xD;
      battery of psychometric and observational measures. A second aim is to determine whether&#xD;
      neurophysiological measures (EEG frequency, EEG-coherence, EP) and vascular activity (blood&#xD;
      pressure) reflect central nervous system and autonomic changes that directly correlate with&#xD;
      reductions in dementia-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the study will investigate the following hypotheses -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Music employed as a therapeutic medium will reduce symptomatic cognitive, behavioural,&#xD;
           emotional and functional deficits associated with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Symptomatic changes will correlate with physiological changes. METHODOLOGY: This study&#xD;
           will take advantage of an established collaborative network between the Department of&#xD;
           Psychiatry, The University of Melbourne, The National Ageing Research Institute, The&#xD;
           Cognitive, Dementia and Memory Service (CDAMS) at The Royal Melbourne Hospital and the&#xD;
           CDAMS at the St George's Hospital campus of St Vincent's Health. The research team&#xD;
           covers several disciplines including aged psychiatry, neuropsychiatry, geriatric&#xD;
           medicine, neuropsychology, behavioural neuroscience, electrophysiology, music and music&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS: One hundred and eighty sub-acute patients with mild, moderate and severe dementia&#xD;
      will be recruited from RMH (Royal Park Campus) and St Georges Hospital over a period of 18&#xD;
      months. There will be a potential pool of approximately 800 patients over the planned 18&#xD;
      month data collection period. We anticipate that with ineligibility of 30%, an attrition rate&#xD;
      of up to 20-25% and time lost to holidays and a participation rate of 70%, our total cohort&#xD;
      will be approximately 260, leaving substantial redundancy over the numbers required to power&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing will commence when each patient has settled for one week when the majority of&#xD;
      illnesses are stabilised and medications adjusted. A full medical assessment will be&#xD;
      available for all participants in order to evaluate medical comorbidity, cognitive status and&#xD;
      dementia diagnosis. This information will include results of physical examination, blood&#xD;
      tests, Ct scan, informant history and neuropsychological assessment which includes the&#xD;
      administration of the MMSE (Folstein et al. 1975) and classification according to DSM-IV,&#xD;
      ICD-10 and NINCDS-ARDRA criteria, the current research gold standard for dementia diagnosis&#xD;
      (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Consensus diagnosis with information available will&#xD;
      be made by the clinicians involved in the study. Primary diagnoses, comorbidities and&#xD;
      medications will be monitored. Recruitment will be undertaken in accordance with procedures&#xD;
      approved by The Mental Health Research and Ethics Committee, Melbourne Health Network, the St&#xD;
      Vincent's Health Research Ethics Committee. Given the nature of our participants' diagnoses,&#xD;
      it is recognised that they cannot give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE: Participants will be randomly assigned to either the music intervention group or&#xD;
      the control (occupational therapy) group. Both groups will undertake three 50 minute&#xD;
      intervention sessions per week for three weeks giving a total of nine interventions. Each&#xD;
      session will be conducted with groups of 4 - 6 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre and post measures will be made on the day prior to the therapy session and the day after&#xD;
      the last therapy session. These measures are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EEG recording made that will yield slow/fast ratio data and resting state and&#xD;
           music-listening EEG-coherence data and auditory evoked potential data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four blood pressure and pulse readings taken at hourly intervals to establish a mean&#xD;
           baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires - Mini Mental State Examination, Hierarchic Dementia Scale, Geriatric&#xD;
           Depression Scale will be administered prior to the first intervention session and after&#xD;
           the ninth intervention session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre and post testing involving will take approximately 90 minutes in total. Video recordings&#xD;
      will be made using two cameras during the fifth therapy session. The first camera will be&#xD;
      located on a tripod such that the whole group, including the therapist, will be continuously&#xD;
      in frame to facilitate subsequent observations about participation and social interactions.&#xD;
      The second camera will be hand held and will take film of the faces of each participant&#xD;
      during the session for subsequent coding of changes in facial expressions using the Facial&#xD;
      Activation Coding System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further information will be compiled by members of the research team. This information, used&#xD;
      to monitor comorbid conditions and pre and post changes, will be derived from patient&#xD;
      records. It will be collected the following instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Clinical Dementia rating Scale (Hughes et al, 1982)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Barthel Index (Mahoney and Barthel, 1965)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (Linn et al 1968).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (Cummings, 1997) Finally, The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation&#xD;
           Inventory (Weiner et al, 1998) will administered pre and post intervention by a&#xD;
           researcher in consultation with nursing staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above measures, the full range of treatments outside the music therapy&#xD;
      interventions received by participants in both groups will be documented. This will enable&#xD;
      the researchers to monitor the levels of therapist contact experienced by participants in&#xD;
      both the music therapy and control groups. It will also provide data that may be used as&#xD;
      covariates in a number of statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA:People with a clinical diagnosis of dementia who are currently in&#xD;
      sub-acute aged care hospital wards; EXCLUSION CRITERIA: delirium; acute medical conditions&#xD;
      (eg pneumonia and cardiac failure) where it is likely that participation is contra-indicated;&#xD;
      primary psychiatric conditions; severe hearing impairment; RANDOMISATION PROCEDURES: A&#xD;
      stratified randomization procedure will be used to ensure that both the experimental and&#xD;
      control groups are at least broadly homogeneous with respect to cognitive status. The&#xD;
      procedure will be applied separately within each of the two hospital facilities with&#xD;
      allocation made progressively as people enter the study. After consent has been acquired and&#xD;
      the pre-intervention measures taken, participants will be coded, stratified into two levels&#xD;
      according to MMSE scores then allocated to treatment groups according to the computer&#xD;
      generated random sequences. The sequences will be generated using research randomiser, an&#xD;
      online web-based program (http://www.randomizer.org/form.htm). The person responsible for&#xD;
      implementing the allocation sequence will be either a member of the hospital staff or a NARI&#xD;
      staff member who has no involvement in any other aspect of the study. That person will be&#xD;
      responsible for de-identifying participants using a conventional coding system. Baseline and&#xD;
      post-intervention data collection procedures will be administered by persons who have no&#xD;
      other role in the project procedures and will remain blind to treatment allocation. Baseline&#xD;
      testing will take place before allocation. As they will have no contact with participants&#xD;
      during the intervention procedures and because patient identification is coded by an&#xD;
      independent person, the blind can be maintained. As added protection, psychometric&#xD;
      instruments (MMSE, HDS and GDS) will be assessed only once by an assessor for each&#xD;
      participant. That is, if Assessor A administers the instruments with Participant A for&#xD;
      baseline testing, Assessor B will administer the instruments post-intervention for&#xD;
      Participant A. This will avoid any unintended prior knowledge of individual participant&#xD;
      performance and so help to ensure post-treatment blinding with respect to active versus&#xD;
      control group assignment. The instruments to be used have clear and established&#xD;
      implementation procedures with high inter-rater reliability. After the post-intervention&#xD;
      assessments have been taken for each participant, the assessors will be asked to nominate&#xD;
      which group they thought the participant was in. A simple statistical analysis will be able&#xD;
      to detect whether there is a significant bias in group assignment or whether assignment is no&#xD;
      better than chance. Bias may arise, for example, if one treatment group has an outcome that&#xD;
      strongly differentiates it from the other.. It is noted that, while there are other potential&#xD;
      stratification factors (eg age, gender, diagnoses), the use of more factors rapidly becomes&#xD;
      unfeasible. Because current cognitive status has some prognostic relevance, particularly with&#xD;
      regard to music therapy, it has been decided to use that measure as the sole stratification&#xD;
      factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Given the multiple dependent variables being monitored in this study, a&#xD;
      MANOVA will be used to test for between-group differences with post-hoc univariate&#xD;
      comparisons as required. Based on previous studies at NARI referred to above using similar&#xD;
      measures we expect that 90 subjects per group will detect a 25% change in mean values with at&#xD;
      least 80% power (alpha .05). For test-retest data, a two way repeated measures MANOVA (group,&#xD;
      time) will be used to examine changes over the duration of the intervention, group effects&#xD;
      and the interaction between these factors. Bivariate correlations and multiple regression&#xD;
      analyses will be used to explore the relationships between the various measures (EEG, FACS,&#xD;
      MMSE, HDS, self-report and observational measures). Similar comparisons can also be made for&#xD;
      change scores within each domain of parameters (objective, psychometric, self-report) and the&#xD;
      way they co-vary over time.&#xD;
