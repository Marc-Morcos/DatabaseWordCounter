  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A medicine that is FDA-approved for bone marrow stimulation (called sargramostim) will be&#xD;
      tested for its safety and efficacy in individuals with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      over a six month treatment period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial protocol is designed to evaluate primarily whether the long-term use of&#xD;
      sargramostim (recombinant human GM-CSF), administered five days per week for six consecutive&#xD;
      months (24 weeks), will be tolerated by and safe for use in participants with&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate AD, secondarily whether sargramostim can slow, halt, or reverse cognitive&#xD;
      decline, and exploratory whether sargramostim can slow, halt, or reverse decline in&#xD;
      activities of daily living, reverse or improve several biomarkers associated with AD, as&#xD;
      evaluated by multimodal neuroimaging techniques and blood and cerebrospinal fluid analyses.&#xD;
      This trial extends the safety results from recently completed Phase 2 double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial in mild-to-moderate AD participants (NCT01409915,&#xD;
      COMIRB#12-1273), using sargramostim that was administered five days per week for three&#xD;
      consecutive weeks and in which there were no incidence of drug-related serious adverse events&#xD;
      (SAEs).&#xD;
