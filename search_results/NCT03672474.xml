  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REGEnLIFE RGn530 is a photobiomodulation medical device, consisting in a modular helmet and&#xD;
      abdominal panel, composed of near-infrared low-level lasers (LLLT), near-infrared and red&#xD;
      LEDs as well as a static magnetic field. RGn device application on both head and abdomen have&#xD;
      demonstrated striking efficacy in preclinical studies. The investigator's results clearly&#xD;
      indicated that RGn treatment produces a normalization of all parameters that are strongly&#xD;
      modified in the model, including memory performances associated to oxidative stress,&#xD;
      neuroinflammation or apoptosis markers, microbiota composition and specific markers related&#xD;
      to the amyloid or tau processes (Blivet et al., Alzheimers Dement (NY), 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following such promising results, this pilot clinical study will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of REGEnLIFE RGn530 device on cognitive performances evolution from mild-to-moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease patients. The double-blind, randomized, monocentric sham-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial will be performed at the CHU de Montpellier. 64 patients will be enrolled: 32&#xD;
      in photobiomodulation group and 32 in sham group. Each patient will follow 8 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with 5 sessions of 25min per week (total of 40 sessions) and will undergo, for a&#xD;
      total period of three months, series of clinical examinations including cognitive evaluation,&#xD;
      biological and electrophysiological analyses, sleep recordings, and imaging assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGEnLIFE RGn530 medical device will follow EC labelling if proven to be safe and effective.&#xD;
      In the light of anti-amyloid therapeutic approaches lack of success, RGn530 dual treatment is&#xD;
      hoped to be particularly valuable as an innovative and extensive treatment strategy for AD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Design : Prospective monocentric double-blind pilot study with 2 parallel groups of 32&#xD;
      patients. One with photobiomodulation (device set up and activated), the other with&#xD;
      placebo-sham procedure (device set up but not activated). The study will consist of an&#xD;
      inclusion visit (V0, D-30 to D-10), a photobiomodulation start visit (V1, D0), followed by 3&#xD;
      follow-up visits (V2 to D30, V3 to D60 and V4 to D90).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dispositive : Photobiomodulation device developed by REGEnLIFE, RGn530 consisting of a&#xD;
      modular helmet and an abdominal modular panel each comprising modules composed of low&#xD;
      intensity infrared lasers (LLLT - Low Level Laser Therapy), infrared and red LEDs and a&#xD;
      static magnetic field. The helmet and abdominal panel devices are connected to a steering&#xD;
      console. Activation of the device will be done by personnel trained for this purpose by&#xD;
      REGEnLIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originality and innovation : This study proposes to evaluate a new medical photobiomodulation&#xD;
      device in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. These techniques have shown positive and&#xD;
      promising results in the following areas: wound healing, pain management, inflammation,&#xD;
      tissue regeneration, and the following disciplines: neuropsychiatry, dermatology and&#xD;
      neurology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photobiomodulation is a technology of the same family as phototherapy, also called LLLT (Low&#xD;
      Level Laser Therapy). It can be defined as the directional use of monochromatic or&#xD;
      polychromatic light from low energy lasers and / or LEDs, in wavelengths included in the&#xD;
      visible, infrared and near infrared, to modulate a function or induce a therapeutic effect in&#xD;
      an athermal, non-invasive and non-destructive manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this new non-invasive&#xD;
      pre-marking device in patients with mild to moderate AD. To date, no study has been published&#xD;
      with this device on this typology of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment : 8 weeks with 5 sessions of 25 minutes per week, for a total of 40&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population : Patients with international AD diagnosis criteria according to McKhann et&#xD;
      al., 2011 at mild to moderate stage (MMSE score between 16-26), having agreed and signed free&#xD;
      and informed consent to participate in this study, without contraindications to the carrying&#xD;
      out of the complementary investigations necessary for the evaluation of the efficiency and&#xD;
      the tolerance of the RGn530.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of visits : Each patient will be followed for 3 months at the rate of 5 visits:&#xD;
      inclusion V0 (D-10 to D-30), V1 (D0), V2 (M1), V3 (M2) and V4 (M3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients : 64 patients will be included in this study: 32 in the photobiomodulation&#xD;
      group and 32 in the placebo-sham group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of patient follow-up : Each patient will be followed for a total duration of 3&#xD;
      months with visits involving clinical, biological, electrophysiological, imaging, tests and&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess the efficacy and tolerance of RGn530.&#xD;
