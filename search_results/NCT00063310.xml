  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ALADDIN is a research study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of leuprolide (a&#xD;
      hormone drug) to improve the cognitive function and slow the progression of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD). In women leuprolide is commonly used to treat hormone related conditions such&#xD;
      as endometriosis and uterine fibroids. The study will include treatment of women 65 years and&#xD;
      older with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who reside in the community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include the treatment of participants with mild to moderate AD, and the&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different doses of leuprolide to&#xD;
      improve the cognitive function and slow the progression of AD, as measured by the ADAS-COG&#xD;
      and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Measures of behavioral disturbances and quality of&#xD;
      life of the caregiver will be made also. The study design is randomized, double blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel group design with a 2:1 randomization of drug to placebo. Sample&#xD;
      size will include 90 participants&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who satisfy all of the inclusion criteria listed below will be eligible for entry&#xD;
        into the trial. Patients will be considered eligible if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They give their consent by signing the IRB-approved Informed Consent Form and the&#xD;
             responsible caregiver also signs the consent form; or, if the patient is judged by the&#xD;
             Investigator to be unable to give consent, if the legally authorized representative&#xD;
             gives consent by signing the consent form and the patient gives assent, in accord with&#xD;
             local regulations;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are female;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are 65 years of age or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a diagnosis of probable AD according to the National Institute of&#xD;
             Neurological Disorders-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association&#xD;
             (NINDS-ADRDA) criteria and the Investigator ascertains that the condition was present&#xD;
             at least 6 months prior to screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are taking a cholinesterase inhibitor, they began taking it at least 90 days&#xD;
             prior to baseline and, in the Investigator's opinion, the dosage will likely remain&#xD;
             stable throughout the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are taking other drugs or substances that have purported cognition enhancing&#xD;
             properties such as ginkgo biloba and Vitamin E, they began taking it at least 60 days&#xD;
             prior to baseline and, in the Investigator's opinion, the dosage will likely remain&#xD;
             stable throughout the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They score no lower than 12 or higher than 24 on the (MMSE) administered at the&#xD;
             screening visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have had a brain imaging study (CT scan, MRI or PET) performed at the time of&#xD;
             their initial diagnosis of AD or after that time, and the findings were consistent&#xD;
             with a diagnosis of probable AD, or, if a brain imaging study has not been performed,&#xD;
             one will be performed during the screening process;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Their Rosen Modified Hachinski score was 4 or lower at the screening visit, supporting&#xD;
             the Investigator's clinical judgment that the patient's dementia is probable AD and&#xD;
             not of vascular origin;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are fluent in English or Spanish and completed at least 6 years of education;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They live at home or in a congregate living facility for requirements other than&#xD;
             skilled nursing care, and have a caregiver who sees the patient at least three time a&#xD;
             week for a total of at least 10 hours and can sign the consent form, provide&#xD;
             information pertinent to the patient's cognitive status, accompany the patient on&#xD;
             clinic visits and participate in the evaluations;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Their hormone replacement therapy (HRT), if any, has been stable for at least 60 days&#xD;
             prior to baseline, and is not expected to change during the course of the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They score less than 15 on the Hamilton Depression Scale (17-item version) (HamD)&#xD;
             administered as part of the screening evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absorptiometry (dual-energy x-ray absorpometry (DEXA) scan), performed at screening,&#xD;
             was within normal limits (i.e., a T- score of no less than -2.0); or, if their DEXA&#xD;
             measure was abnormally low, they were receiving treatment for osteoporosis for at&#xD;
             least 3 weeks and that treatment is not expected to change during the course of the&#xD;
             trial; or, if their DEXA measure was abnormally low and they are not receiving&#xD;
             treatment for osteoporosis, they may enter the trial after 3 weeks of treatment&#xD;
             provided that assessments of the HamD, concomitant medications, ECG tracing and&#xD;
             laboratory tests performed within 45 days of baseline show that they are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  values on their screening laboratory tests do not indicate significant medical&#xD;
             conditions that would interfere with their participation in and completion of the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any of the exclusion criteria listed below will be ineligible for entry into&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  They are younger than 65 years of age;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  They are taking a cholinesterase inhibitor (tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, or&#xD;
             galantamine) for less than 90 days prior to baseline; or, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, they are likely to either require a change in dose or discontinuation of&#xD;
             the drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have never received cholinesterase inhibitor treatment and are likely to initiate&#xD;
             it;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They started or changed within 60 days prior to the screening visit the dosage of any&#xD;
             drug (including an over the counter drug) that affects cognitive function, such as&#xD;
             neuroleptics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics, anti-convulsants,&#xD;
             centrally acting antihypertensive agents such as clonidine and Aldomet; or other&#xD;
             medications that have been shown to have possible effects on cognition such as Vitamin&#xD;
             E, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and hormone replacement therapy, or&#xD;
             if, in the Investigator's opinion, the dosage of such medication is likely to be&#xD;
             changed during the course of this trial. Any changes in the dosage of any of these&#xD;
             drugs during the course of the trial and the reason for the change must be fully&#xD;
             recorded in the concomitant medication page of the patient's case report form (CRF).&#xD;

             and they were not receiving treatment for osteoporosis for at least 3 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a screening HamD score of 15 or higher;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Their abuse or dependence on alcohol or other substances satisfy criteria for DSM-IV&#xD;
