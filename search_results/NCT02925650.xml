      This study evaluates the safety and pharmacological effects of 3 different doses of Posiphen®&#xD;
      when compared to a placebo, in adult male and female patients with early Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (AD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posiphen®, which was discovered by the US National Institute on Aging (NIA) is a small,&#xD;
      orally active, experimental drug that specifically inhibits the synthesis of amyloid&#xD;
      precursor protein (APP), Tau and α-Synuclein. It is distinct from other Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      drugs currently in development, because it inhibits the formation of several toxic proteins,&#xD;
      rather than removing individual toxic protein after they are produced. Posiphen has potential&#xD;
      utility as a disease modifying treatment for AD. The present study will confirm the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of Posiphen and its metabolites in plasma and cerebral spinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF). It will also measure the effects of a 23-25 day treatment period with Posiphen on the&#xD;
      CSF and plasma levels of a number of biomarkers, inflammatory factors and control proteins.&#xD;
      It will also expand the safety data in humans by extending the treatment period from 10 days&#xD;
      to a treatment period from 23-25 days. In addition, this study will measure concentrations of&#xD;
      various soluble biomarkers in CSF and use the SILK™ assay methods to directly measure the&#xD;
      effect of Posiphen on the fractional synthesis rate of Aβ40 in CSF, which will help guide the&#xD;
      further development of Posiphen and determine the feasibility of SILK™ in a multicenter&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

             for at least 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female participants will be given a urine pregnancy test at the screening visit for&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. To qualify for entry, subjects will have a CSF Abeta42-Abeta40 ratio below 0.131 that&#xD;
             is consistent with Alzheimers disease as measured via mass spectrometry by C2N.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. General cognition and functional performance sufficiently preserved that the subject&#xD;
             can provide written informed consent.&#xD;

             screening visit and the baseline visit. The study drug is dispensed to the participant&#xD;
             at the baseline visit and the study partner (or other individual) should also oversee&#xD;
             study drug administration if needed to ensure compliance with dose regimen. At a&#xD;
             minimum, the study partner should stay for the first 3 hours of the confinement visit&#xD;

             intervening neurological disease. Lacunes that are not believed to contribute to the&#xD;
             subjects cognitive impairment are permissible. If there is no MRI available within a&#xD;
             12-month timeframe, then an MRI must be performed as part of the screening procedures&#xD;
             for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Stability of permitted medications for 4 weeks prior to baseline. NOTE: Cholinesterase&#xD;

             If taking Arciept (donezepil), no more than 10 mg/day is permitted during the course&#xD;
             of the study.&#xD;
