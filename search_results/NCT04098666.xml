    <textblock>
      MAP will be a multisite phase II/III 1:1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) of long acting&#xD;
      metformin (reduced mass Glucophage XR) vs. matching placebo in 370 men and women with early&#xD;
      and late aMCI, without diabetes, not treated with metformin, overweight or obese, aged 55&#xD;
      years to 90 years. The RCT will last 24 months and have 5 visits: baseline, 6-months,&#xD;
      12-months, 18-months, and 24-months. The RCT will be preceded by a screening phase followed&#xD;
      by randomization and a titration period in which drug/placebo will be titrated from 500 mg a&#xD;
      day (one tablet) to 2,000 mg a day (4 tablets), in increments of 500 mg (one tablet) every 10&#xD;
      days. Participants will remain in the RCT on the tolerated dose, and included in analyses on&#xD;
      an intent to treat basis. We expect the attrition rate to be 10%/year. Neuropsychological&#xD;
      battery, clinical interviews, physical exam, and phlebotomy will be conducted at baseline and&#xD;
      every 6 months. Brain MRI will be conducted in approximately half of the participants (186)&#xD;
      twice, at baseline, and after the last study visit at month 24. We will also conduct brain&#xD;
      amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using 18F-Florbetaben, and tau PET using&#xD;
      18F-MK6240 in half of the participants at baseline and end of the RCT. The primary clinical&#xD;
      outcome of the study will be changes in the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test. The&#xD;
      secondary clinical outcome will be changes in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study&#xD;
      Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite. Secondary subclinical outcomes will be changes&#xD;
      in cortical thickness AD signature areas, changes in white matter hyperintensity volume,&#xD;
      changes in brain amyloid burden, changes in brain tau burden, and changes in plasma&#xD;
      biomarkers of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration. The data coordinating center and Imaging&#xD;
      Core is located at John Hopkins University. The PET coordinating center is located at&#xD;
      UC-Berkeley. The Clinical Coordinating and Monitoring Center and the central laboratory will&#xD;
      be located at Columbia. The Research pharmacy function will be shared by the University of&#xD;
      Rochester, which will dispense randomization kits, and the University of Iowa, which will&#xD;
      receive bulk metformin and identical matching placebo from EMD Serono.&#xD;

      STUDY PROCEDURES AT THE LEVEL OF THE PARTICIPANT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening. We propose a 2-tier approach for screening, including telephone pre-screening&#xD;
           followed by in-person screening. Telephone screening includes questions about inclusion&#xD;
           and exclusion criteria including demographics (age, language), medical history,&#xD;
           contraindications to metformin, and medications. In-person screening includes consent,&#xD;
           in-person anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist and hip circumference),&#xD;
           vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), EKG, laboratory tests (TSH, RPR, vitamin&#xD;
           B12, complete blood count [CBC], basic metabolic panel [BMP], Hepatic panel, Lipid&#xD;
           panel, and Hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]), and the in person-neuropsychological battery that is&#xD;
           used to determine aMCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline/screening study visit. History includes age, handedness, education, occupation&#xD;
           and employment history, past medical history, and all medications utilized, including a&#xD;
           judgment as to whether they affect cognition (positively or negatively). Referral source&#xD;
           is also documented. Psychiatric history, current and past history of depression, current&#xD;
           anxiety, alcohol and other substance use, head injury, hypertension, cardiac disease,&#xD;
           thyroid disease, other major medical conditions, and surgery are evaluated at screening.&#xD;
           A full medical history will be obtained only at screening. Any report of events, or side&#xD;
           effects will prompt a full history and physical exam at any visit. Physical exam will be&#xD;
           conducted at screening, with particular emphasis on signs of congestive heart failure,&#xD;
           pulmonary, liver, or renal disease for contraindications to metformin, and neurologic&#xD;
           examination for the presence of neurologic diseases. Vital signs including blood&#xD;
           pressure and heart rate will also be ascertained. Standing height will be measured using&#xD;
           a stadiometer calibrated in cm. Body weight is measured using a balance beam scale&#xD;
           calibrated in kg. With the participant standing, measurements are taken to the nearest&#xD;
           0.1 kg of weight with a balance scale and height without shoes to nearest 0.5 cm, to&#xD;
           calculate BMI (weight in k/height in m2). Waist circumference (WC) is measured at the&#xD;
           level of the umbilicus. Hip circumference (HP) is measured at the level of maximal&#xD;
           protrusion of the gluteal muscles. Resting Blood Pressure (BP) will be measured using an&#xD;
           automated oscillometric device, 3 measurements will be obtained at 1-minute intervals in&#xD;
           a seated position after 5 minutes of rest. The average of the 2nd and 3rd measurements&#xD;
           will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Neuropsychological battery. Total Recall Score of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding&#xD;
           Test (FCSRT). The FCSRT is a 16 item word list with visual and auditory presentation&#xD;
           that uses semantic cuing to facilitate encoding and retrieval. The test has a score&#xD;
           range of 0 to 48. Paragraph Recall on the Logical Memory IIa (episodic memory): Free&#xD;
           recall of 1 short story that consists of 25 bits of information will be elicited&#xD;
           immediately after it is read aloud to the subject and again after approximately&#xD;
           30-minute delay. The total bits of information from the story that are recalled&#xD;
           immediately (maximum score = 25) and after the delay interval (maximum score = 25) are&#xD;
           recorded. The delay score (0-25 story units) will be used in the composite. Digit-Symbol&#xD;
           Substitution Test: The Digit Symbol Substitution test is a subset from the WAIS-R. The&#xD;
           test consists of 110 small blank squares presented in 7 rows with 1 of 9 numbers (1-9)&#xD;
           randomly printed directly above each blank square. A &quot;key&quot; is printed above the rows of&#xD;
           blank squares. The &quot;key&quot; pairs numbers 1 through 9 with an unfamiliar symbol. The&#xD;
           subject must work as fast as possible for 90 seconds. The measure of interest is number&#xD;
           of squares filled in correctly within the time limit (maximum raw score = 110). Mini&#xD;
           Mental Status Exam (MMSE). The MMSE scale evaluates orientation, memory, attention,&#xD;
           concentration, naming, repetition, comprehension, and ability to create a sentence and&#xD;
           to copy 2 overlapping pentagons. The MMSE is scored as the number of correctly completed&#xD;
           items with a lower score indicative of poorer performance and greater cognitive&#xD;
           impairment. The total score ranges from 0 (worse) to 30 (perfect). Trail-Making Test,&#xD;
           Part A: This test of visuoperceptual ability, attention and speed consists of 25 circles&#xD;
           distributed over a white sheet of 8 1/2&quot; X 11&quot; paper that are numbered. The participant&#xD;
           is instructed to connect the circles with a pencil line as quickly as possible all&#xD;
           numbers in an ascending order (e.g., 1 to 2; 2 to 3; etc). The participant's performance&#xD;
           is judged in terms of the time (in seconds) required to complete the task and by the&#xD;
           number of errors of commission and omission. The time to complete the trial will be the&#xD;
           measures of interest. Trail-Making Test, Part B: This test of visuoperceptual ability,&#xD;
           attention and set-shifting ability consists of 25 circles distributed over a white sheet&#xD;
           of 8 1/2&quot; X 11&quot; paper that are either numbered (1 through 13) or contain letters (A&#xD;
           through L). The participant is instructed to connect the circles with a pencil line as&#xD;
           quickly as possible while alternating between numbers and letters in an ascending order&#xD;
           (e.g., A to 1; 1 to B; B to 2; 2 to C). The participant's performance is judged in terms&#xD;
           of the time (in seconds) required to complete the task and by the number of errors of&#xD;
           commission and omission. The time to complete the trial will be the measures of&#xD;
           interest. Trail-Making Test, Part B is available in multiple forms of equal difficulty&#xD;
           for purposes of repeated evaluations. ADAScog12. This test will be used as part of the&#xD;
           core battery and assesses memory, reasoning, naming, orientation, ideational praxis,&#xD;
           constructional praxis, spoken language, language comprehension, word finding difficulty,&#xD;
           and ability to remember test instructions. The addition of a 10 word delay recall adds&#xD;
           sensitivity in aMCI and yields maximum score of 80. Functional abilities:&#xD;
           ADCS-ADL-PI:The ADCS-ADL-PI was developed in the ADCS Prevention Instruments Trial. The&#xD;
           subject rates his/her performance of 18 IADL tasks over the past 2 months. Questions&#xD;
           about use of technology (e.g., computers and cell phones) are included. Responses for&#xD;
           each IADL include improved IADL performance (fewer errors, faster completion, less need&#xD;
           to refer to notes or instructions), no change ('as well as usual'), various levels of&#xD;
           impaired performance, and non-performance. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). The CDR is a&#xD;
           clinical scale that rates the severity of dementia as absent, questionable, mild,&#xD;
           moderate, or severe (CDR score of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3, respectively). The score is based&#xD;
           on interviews with the subject and study partner, using a structured interview that&#xD;
           assesses 6 domains: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community&#xD;
           affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The ratings of degree of impairment&#xD;
           obtained on each of the 6 categories of function are synthesized into 1 global rating of&#xD;
           dementia (ranging from 0 to 3), with more refined measure of change available by use of&#xD;
           the Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Reliability and validity has been established, as has high&#xD;
           inter-rater reliability. Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q): The MAC-Q consists of&#xD;
           six items. The first five items relate to specific situations that are frequently&#xD;
           reported as troublesome for those with declining memory, and the last item broadly&#xD;
           measures overall self-perceived memory decline. Cognitive diagnoses. The research&#xD;
           physician will complete the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centers (NACC) Assessment&#xD;
           and Uniform Data Set (UDS), which takes 35 minutes and includes detailed medical and&#xD;
           family history, and neurological exam, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating&#xD;
           Scale for extrapyramidal signs, psychiatric assessment with the short version of the&#xD;
           Geriatric Depression Scale and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) questions, assessment of&#xD;
           vascular risk factors plus the Hachinski scale, and a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR).&#xD;
           Cognitive diagnosis will be examined for inclusion and exclusion purposes and will also&#xD;
           be examined as an exploratory outcome. For cognitive diagnosis transitions (i.e.&#xD;
           conversion from MCI to dementia), an adjudication panel at the CCMC will conduct monthly&#xD;
           consensus meetings or calls. This panel will be comprised of co-investigators&#xD;
           Luchsinger, Goldberg, Devanand. During the meeting information of all the cognitive,&#xD;
           functional and other clinical information of the subjects will be presented, blind to&#xD;
           study allocation. Evidence of cognitive deficits (based on the neuropsychological&#xD;
           scores), evidence of impairment in social or occupational function (as assessed by the&#xD;
           functional measures), and evidence of cognitive and social-occupational function decline&#xD;
           will be the criteria used for the diagnosis of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization. Eligible participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either&#xD;
           metformin or placebo, using randomly permuted block randomization of size two or four by&#xD;
           each site to achieve balance of treatment assignment overall and by site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Titration. After participants consent, are deemed eligible, and complete the baseline&#xD;
           assessment, they will complete a 30-day titration period in which the metformin/placebo&#xD;
           dose will be increased from 500 mg a day at randomization in increments of 500 mg every&#xD;
           10 days to a maximum of 2,000 mg a day. Participants will have in person visits every 10&#xD;
           days to check on their drug/placebo tolerance.The metformin tablets are taken together&#xD;
           as a single dose, usually recommended once at night. Participants will remain on the&#xD;
           highest dose tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Baseline Brain MRI. Participants will be invited to have a baseline brain MRI without&#xD;
           contrast. We expect that brain 3T MRI will be conducted in 186 participants across all&#xD;
           sites. MRI sequences will include 3Plane Gradient Echo Localizer, 3D MPRAGE T1, 3D T2,&#xD;
           DTI 30 direction, DTI 30 direction, pCASL Axial, pCASL Axial Calibration. Acquisition of&#xD;
           these sequences will take approximately 50 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Baseline Brain Amyloid PET: Amyloid PET imaging will be obtained using 18F-Florbetaben.&#xD;
           18F-Florbetaben will be injected as 8.1 mCi, with image acquisition 90-110 min post&#xD;
           injection (following CT or transmission scan) as 4 x 5 min frames.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Baseline Tau PET: Tau PET acquisition will entail injection of 10 mCi of MK6240 with&#xD;
           imaging from 90-110 min after CT or transmission scan.1086. Monthly and ad-lib follow-up&#xD;
           calls, text messages, or mails. We will conduct monthly follow-up calls to inquire about&#xD;
           adverse events and issues with metformin tolerance. We will use the ADCS Adverse Event&#xD;
           Checklist to monitor adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Follow-up visits: We will repeat all clinical (non-brain imaging) assessments at months&#xD;
           6, 12, 18, and 24. The only exception is that we will test TSH and RPR only at baseline.&#xD;
           All other laboratory tests will be repeated. Pill counts will be conducted to assess&#xD;
           compliance with metformin and placebo. We will administer the adverse events checklist.&#xD;
           All remaining study drug or placebo will be retrieved to assess compliance and for&#xD;
           disposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Follow-up Brain MRI. Participants who undergo a baseline MRI will be invited to have a&#xD;
           follow-up brain MRI with the same sequences after the completion of the last visit at&#xD;
           month 24. The MRI will be completed within one month of the last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Follow-up Brain Amyloid PET: Participants who underwent baseline amyloid PET will be&#xD;
           invited to repeat the PET at 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Follow-up Tau PET: Participants who underwent baseline Tau PET will be invited to repeat&#xD;
           the PET at 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Monthly and ad-lib follow-up calls, text messages, or mails. We will conduct monthly&#xD;
           follow-up calls to inquire about adverse events and issues with metformin tolerance.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of aMCI:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have subjective memory concern reported by participant, study&#xD;
             partner, or clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A mini-mental state exam between ≥ 22 for subjects with more than 8 years of&#xD;
             education. For subjects with less than 8 years of education, a MMSE ≥ 20 will be&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical Dementia Rating 0.5. The memory box score must be at least 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General cognition and functional performance sufficiently preserved such that a&#xD;
             diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease cannot be made by the site physician at the time of&#xD;
             the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal memory function documented by scoring within the education adjusted ranges on&#xD;
             the Logical Memory II subscale (Delayed Paragraph Recall, Paragraph A only) from the&#xD;
             Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For early MCI:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  9-11 for 16 or more years of education&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  5-9 for 8-15 years of education&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  3-6 for 0-7 years of education&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For late MCI&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  ≤ 8 for 16 or more years of education&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  ≤ 4 for 8-15 years of education&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  ≤ 2 for 0-7 years of education&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age range: 55 years to 90 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sex distribution: all eligible men and women will be included and no one will be&#xD;
             excluded because of gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Languages: fluent in English or Spanish. We have reliable, well-validated Spanish&#xD;
             tests for all outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants without a known history of diabetes. If diabetes is diagnosed during&#xD;
             screening (hemoglobin A1c of 6.5 % or greater) they will also be excluded. The main&#xD;
             justification for this exclusion is the potential for these participants to be placed&#xD;
             on other diabetes medications that may confound our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General cognition and functional performance such that a diagnosis of dementia cannot&#xD;
             be made at the time of screening based on DSM-V criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vision and hearing must be sufficient for compliance with testing procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have an informant to come to all appointments or be available by telephone at&#xD;
             follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study Partner Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study partner can provide an independent evaluation of functioning for a person&#xD;
             enrolled in the MAP study as a participant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study partner agrees to attend study visits with the MAP participant or be&#xD;
             available by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of metformin for any indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index &lt; 20 k/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metformin is contraindicated in persons with an estimated glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
             (eGFR) of less than 30 mL/min. For persons with an eGFR of 30 to 45 mL/min, a&#xD;
             reduction of the dose or discontinuation of the medication is recommended for those on&#xD;
             metformin; in this range, it is also recommended that persons do not initiate&#xD;
             metformin. Thus, participants with eGFR &lt; 45 mL/min will not be eligible to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The risk of lactic acidosis is increased in persons with liver disease and class III&#xD;
             or IV congestive heart failure. Thus, persons with liver disease other than non-fatty&#xD;
             liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis) or class III or IV congestive heart failure will not&#xD;
             be eligible to participate due to the risks of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of intolerance to metformin used for indications other than diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cerebrovascular accident with residual neurological deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate to severe depression, indicated by a score in the Geriatric Depression Scale&#xD;
             of 9/15 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dementia diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of capacity to consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with neurologic diseases associated with neurologic deficits on clinical&#xD;
             examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with other current Axis I psychiatric diagnoses such as bipolar disorder&#xD;
             or schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcohol or substance abuse or dependence in the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of medications rated as being the likely cause of cognitive impairment. These&#xD;
             include benzodiazepines in dose equivalents greater than 2 mg daily of lorazepam, and&#xD;
             regular use of prescription narcotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal individuals without cognitive complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg or&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure ≥ 95 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with active cancer or a history of cancer within the last two years, with&#xD;
             the exception of squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who for any reason may not complete the study as judged by the study&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants planning to move to another city or state within the next 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a known history of diabetes. The rationale for this exclusion is&#xD;
             persons with diabetes may already be on metformin or on other medications that&#xD;
             increase insulin levels and could confound the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with diabetes discovered on screening based on American Diabetes&#xD;
             Association criteria using HbA1c (HbA1c of 6.5% or greater). Although metformin could&#xD;
             be a first treatment of diabetes for these participants, addition of treatments for&#xD;
             diabetes by physicians could confound the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of aducanumab (Aduhelm™) of any other amyloid modifying treatment for AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not able to undergo phlebotomy as reported by the participant or determined by the&#xD;
             study coordinator or physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known, suspected, or plan for becoming pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraindications for MRI include inability to lie flat, claustrophobia, or presence of&#xD;
        indwelling metal objects or implants that are not MRI compatible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for PET&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of adverse reactions to radiocontrast agents.&#xD;
