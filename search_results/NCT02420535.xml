  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral symptoms that commonly occur with dementia are associated with increased health&#xD;
      care utilization and can lead to challenges for the person living with dementia and their&#xD;
      caregivers. Caregivers need knowledge and skills to monitor these behaviors, to identify what&#xD;
      triggers them, and to learn how to use proven, practical medication-free strategies to&#xD;
      prevent and manage the behaviors. The purpose of this study is to develop and test the&#xD;
      WeCareAdvisor, a customized, internet-based computer tool for family caregivers that helps&#xD;
      them to assess, manage and track behavioral symptoms and their contributing factors (e.g.,&#xD;
      pain, sleep disturbance), and that provides tailored strategies for in-home, medication-free&#xD;
      behavior management. This study is a collaboration between researchers at the University of&#xD;
      Michigan and Johns Hopkins University.&#xD;
