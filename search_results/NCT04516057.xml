  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at whether nabilone is an effective treatment for agitation in&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Agitation is highly prevalent in patients with AD and is&#xD;
      one of the most distressing and challenging-to-treat symptoms. Agitation is associated with&#xD;
      faster progression to institutionalization, increased caregiver burden, poorer quality of&#xD;
      life, and increased risk of death. In addition, current pharmacological options show only&#xD;
      modest efficacy and elevated risks of adverse events. Therefore, identifying safer and more&#xD;
      effective treatments for agitation in AD is a clinical and research priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nabilone is a synthetic cannabinoid that is Health Canada-approved to treat&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI's research group completed a 6-week double-blind placebo-controlled randomized&#xD;
      cross-over pilot trial in 38 patients with moderate-to-severe AD, providing the first&#xD;
      preliminary evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of nabilone in this population. They&#xD;
      found that nabilone significantly improved agitation, overall neuropsychiatric symptoms, and&#xD;
      caregiver distress. That study was limited by its sample size and questions remain regarding&#xD;
      the efficacy of nabilone for nutrition and pain and predictors of response. However, the&#xD;
      promising preliminary findings encourage a pivotal, practice-changing phase III trial to&#xD;
      inform clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomized to receive either nabilone or a placebo for 8&#xD;
      weeks. In addition to looking at the effectiveness of nabilone in treating agitation, the&#xD;
      researchers will also look at whether it is beneficial for other relevant outcomes for&#xD;
      patients with AD including overall neuropsychiatric symptoms, caregiver distress, cognition,&#xD;
      nutritional status, and pain. Participants will also be followed for 8 weeks following&#xD;
      completion of the study treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Agitation - Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 Weeks) to 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 29-point scale that measures agitation in two dimensions, verbal and physical, each of which having two poles, aggressive and non-aggressive. Scores range from 29-203 points, with a higher score indicating a worse outcome. This includes the CMAI IPA Agitation Score &amp; CMAI IPA Delphi Modification, which are derived from the CMAI.</description>

The frequency and severity of these symptoms are judged on a 4-point and 3-point scale, respectively. Scores range from 0-144 points, with a higher score indicating a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Global Change - Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression of Severity/Change (ADCS-CGIS/C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 Weeks) to 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A commonly-used clinician-rated scale that quantifies disease severity and clinical change (worsening, no change, or improvement), based on information regarding the patient's medical history, cognition, behaviour, and function. Numerical scores are not assigned.</description>

    <measure>Sedation - Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser (UKU) Side-Effect Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 Weeks) to 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sedation will be measured using the Sleepiness/Sedation subscale of the UKU-Side Effect Rating Scale. The UKU is a clinician-rated scale that assesses the side effects of psychopharmacological medications. Scores range from 0-3, with a higher score indicating more sleepiness/sedation.</description>
