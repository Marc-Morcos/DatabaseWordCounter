    <textblock>
      Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) consists of about a quarter of stroke subtype. For elderly,&#xD;
      cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common etiology of ICH. In National Taiwan University&#xD;
      Hospital, we have established a CAA team including neurologists, radiologists and nuclear&#xD;
      medicine physicians since 2014. We hope to go deep into the diagnosis and pathophysiology of&#xD;
      CAA. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other CAA team in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with CAA, abnormal beta amyloid protein diffusely deposits at cerebral&#xD;
      vasculatures, which disrupts the normal vessel structure and increases the risk of bleeding.&#xD;
      The standard diagnosis for CAA requires pathological evidences of amyloid deposition at&#xD;
      cerebral arteries. Clinically, a diagnosis of CAA-related ICH is usually only made in an&#xD;
      elderly developing cortical or subcortical lobar ICH without undergoing biopsy. Brain images&#xD;
      using the SWI sequence of MRI study may show lobar microbleeds in patients with CAA. However,&#xD;
      there is still no direct and precise non-invasive diagnostic tool for CAA until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amyloid PET, using 11C-PiB to image amyloid burden, has been used for detecting the cerebral&#xD;
      amyloid protein deposition in patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD) for years. Recently,&#xD;
      amyloid PET has also been applied in the diagnosis of CAA. CAA patients showed diffusely&#xD;
      increased global PiB retention as compared to control subjects and the distribution of PiB&#xD;
      retention is also different from that seen in patients with AD in general. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      applications of amyloid PET in CAA diagnosis are still not well established and many&#xD;
      important issues still need to be extensively addressed. Furthermore, tau PET has emerged as&#xD;
      a potential molecular imaging marker for SVD. Tau PET provides a noninvasive method for&#xD;
      measuring brain tau load. The correlation of tau PET findings in patients with CAA has not&#xD;
      been investigated before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, ApoE gene has been reported to be risk factor for sporadic CAA as well as AD.&#xD;
      Biochemical biomarkers, such as the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42, also help us understand the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of CAA. Recently, immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assay, using&#xD;
      bio-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles, has been proved to be a sensitive and accurate&#xD;
      tool for the detection of these biological molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By combination of plasma (Aβ40, Aβ42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau, etc.), genetic (ApoE&#xD;
      ε2 or ε4 allele), MRI (cerebral perfusion, microbleeds, cortical superficial siderosis,&#xD;
      enlarged perivascular space, etc.) and PET imaging (amyloid and tau) biomarkers, the study&#xD;
      aims to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enhance the diagnostic potentials of the radiological biomarkers by combining MRI and&#xD;
           amyloid PET in CAA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the biological pathogenesis in CAA patients using the less invasive plasma&#xD;
           biomarkers and to correlate with structural and function imaging, including MRI, amyloid&#xD;
           and tau imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study the characteristics of long-term progression of amyloid deposition in CAA patients&#xD;
           using the radiological, biochemical and genetic biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study the prognosis predicting markers.&#xD;
