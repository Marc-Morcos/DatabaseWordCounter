  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AMOR-Kentucky study will examine the impact of a pharmacist-physician patient-centered&#xD;
      medication therapy management deprescribing intervention to address inappropriate medication&#xD;
      use in patients with cognitive impairment in underserved, lower socioeconomic populations in&#xD;
      rural Appalachian Kentucky. The results of this study will provide valuable insights on how&#xD;
      to expand and implement deprescribing interventions using telemedicine to reduce the&#xD;
      prevalence and the associated healthcare costs of medication-related problems in patients&#xD;
      with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in rural areas&#xD;
      throughout the US. The investigators will assess the potential use of telemedicine in this&#xD;
      population by performing an initial single arm, unblinded study of the medication therapy&#xD;
      management (MTM) describing intervention in rural/underserved Kentucky Appalachian&#xD;
      populations with cognitive impairment and/or dementia using potentially inappropriate&#xD;
      medications (n=50). Following initial recruitment and clinical evaluation, engaged&#xD;
      participants will have their medication list reviewed by a pharmacist-clinician team to&#xD;
      identify targets for deprescribing intervention. The intervention will be engaged remotely&#xD;
      with the participant and their caregiver, and the MTM team at 4 weeks post initial&#xD;
      evaluation, and then reinforced at a 3-month timepoint. This approach will be carried forward&#xD;
      through a telemedicine practice at University of Kentucky that is comprised of approximately&#xD;
      500 patient-caregiver dyads throughout rural areas of Appalachian Kentucky.&#xD;
