    <measure>Core Phase: Change From Baseline up to Month 24 in the Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1: before first dose in the core phase) up to Month 24 of the core phase</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale is a clinical global rating scale that requires interviewing both the participant and an informant who knows and has contact with the participant. The CDR scale is a clinician directed assessment of both cognition and function, and is intended to capture the state and therefore the disease stage of the participant. The CDR scale assesses 6 domains of participant function (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care) on a 5-point scale in which no impairment=0, questionable impairment=0.5, mild impairment=1, moderate impairment=2 and severe impairment=3. The CDR-SB is a sum of the individual domain scores and ranges from 0 to 18. Higher score indicates more impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug up to approximately 6 months (including 1 month follow up) for the extension phase</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE is defined as an adverse event that emerged during treatment or within 28 days following the last dose of study drug, having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline) or reemerged during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (Baseline) but stopped before treatment, or worsened in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the adverse event was continuous. Number of participants with TEAEs (serious and non-serious adverse events) were reported based on their safety assessments of laboratory tests, suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior, drug abuse potential, physical examination, neurological examination, regular measurement of vital signs, magnetic resonance imaging and electrocardiogram parameter values.</description>

    <measure>Core Phase: Change From Baseline up to Month 24 in Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1: before first dose in the core phase) up to Month 24 of the core phase</time_frame>
    <description>ADCOMS is a weighted linear combination of 12 items from three existing clinical scales: the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the CDR. Four items are from the ADAS-cog (A4 [Delayed Word Recall], A7 [Orientation], A8 [Word Recognition], A11 [Word Finding]); 2 items are from the MMSE (M1 [Orientation Time], M7 [Drawing]); 6 items are from the CDR (C1 [Personal Care], C2 [Community Affairs], C3 [Home and Hobbies], C4 [Judgment and Problem Solving], C5 [Memory], C6 [Orientation]). Composite score is derived from the variables from the 12 items, and ranges from 0 to 1.97, where higher score indicates worse performance.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1: before first dose in the core phase) up to Month 24 of the core phase</time_frame>
    <description>Amyloid PET scan assesses cerebral amyloid load using 3 tracers (florbetapir, florbetaben and flutemetamol) which is standardized into centiloids for evaluation of AD. Centiloid values on centiloid scale is based on mean composite SUVR in cingulate, frontal, parietal and temporal cortexes using whole cerebellum as reference region. SUVR is ratio of tracer uptake in each of cingulate, frontal, parietal and temporal cortexes relative to cerebellum. The centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scans.</description>

Higher score indicates more impairment.</description>

    <description>The ADAS-cog14 Word List is a summation of two items: &quot;Immediate Word-recall&quot; and &quot;Delayed Word-recall&quot;. Immediate Word-recall test: Participants are asked to recall words and the number of &quot;No&quot; responses for each trial (total 3 trials) are summed. Subscore: sum of scores from 3 trials, divided by 3. Score ranges from 0 to 10. Delayed Word-recall: Participants used to recall words after a delay and the number of &quot;No&quot; responses are summed. Score ranges from 0 to 10. The Total Score ranges from 0 to 20. Higher score indicates more impairment.</description>

        <title>Core Phase: Change From Baseline up to Month 24 in the Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score</title>
        <description>The clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale is a clinical global rating scale that requires interviewing both the participant and an informant who knows and has contact with the participant. The CDR scale is a clinician directed assessment of both cognition and function, and is intended to capture the state and therefore the disease stage of the participant. The CDR scale assesses 6 domains of participant function (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care) on a 5-point scale in which no impairment=0, questionable impairment=0.5, mild impairment=1, moderate impairment=2 and severe impairment=3. The CDR-SB is a sum of the individual domain scores and ranges from 0 to 18. Higher score indicates more impairment.</description>

        <description>Amyloid PET scan assesses cerebral amyloid load using 3 tracers (florbetapir, florbetaben and flutemetamol) which is standardized into centiloids for evaluation of AD. Centiloid values on centiloid scale is based on mean composite SUVR in cingulate, frontal, parietal and temporal cortexes using whole cerebellum as reference region. SUVR is ratio of tracer uptake in each of cingulate, frontal, parietal and temporal cortexes relative to cerebellum. The centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scans.</description>

        <description>The CDR scale is a clinical global rating scale that requires interviewing both the participant and an informant who knows and has contact with the participant. The CDR scale is a clinician directed assessment of both cognition and function, and is intended to capture the state and therefore the disease stage of the participant. The CDR scale assesses 6 domains of participant function (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care) on a 5-point scale in which no impairment=0, questionable impairment=0.5, mild impairment=1, moderate impairment=2 and severe impairment=3. The CDR-SB is a sum of the individual domain scores and ranges from 0 to 18. Higher score indicates more impairment. Amyloid PET scans allow in vivo assessment of cerebral amyloid load. SUVR indicates the ratio of tracer uptake in the frontal cortex relative to the cerebellum or the ratio of tracer uptake in the whole brain relative to the cerebellum.</description>

          <title>Core Phase: Change From Baseline up to Month 24 in the ADCOMS for Participants Enriched by Baseline Amyloid PET SUVR Between 1.2 and 1.6</title>
          <description>ADCOMS is a weighted linear combination of 12 items from three existing clinical scales: the ADAS-cog, the MMSE, and the CDR. Four items are from the ADAS-cog (A4 [Delayed Word Recall], A7 [Orientation], A8 [Word Recognition], A11 [Word Finding]); 2 items are from the MMSE (M1 [Orientation Time], M7 [Drawing]); 6 items are from the CDR (C1 [Personal Care], C2 [Community Affairs], C3 [Home and Hobbies], C4 [Judgment and Problem Solving], C5 [Memory], C6 [Orientation]). Composite score is derived from the variables from the 12 items, and ranges from 0 to 1.97, where higher score indicates worse performance. Amyloid PET scans allow in vivo assessment of cerebral amyloid load. SUVR indicates the ratio of tracer uptake in the frontal cortex relative to the cerebellum or the ratio of tracer uptake in the whole brain relative to the cerebellum.</description>

        <title>Core Phase: Change Per Year (Mean Slope) in CDR-SB Score up to Month 24</title>
        <description>The CDR scale is a clinical global rating scale that requires interviewing both the participant and an informant who knows and has contact with the participant. The CDR scale is a clinician directed assessment of both cognition and function, and is intended to capture the state and therefore the disease stage of the participant. The CDR scale assesses 6 domains of participant function (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care) on a 5-point scale in which no impairment=0, questionable impairment=0.5, mild impairment=1, moderate impairment=2 and severe impairment=3. The CDR-SB is a sum of the individual domain scores and ranges from 0 to 18. Higher score indicates more impairment. In this outcome measure, change per year (mean slope) in CDR-SB score was calculated up to month 24, where higher change indicated more impairment and lower change indicated less impairment.</description>

        <description>ADAS-cog14 is a psychometric instrument that evaluates 14-items (Immediate Word-recall [0-10], Commands [0-5], Constructional Praxis [0-5], Delayed Word-recall [0-10], Naming Objects/Fingers [0-5], Ideational Praxis [0-5], Orientation[0-8], Word Recognition [0-12], Remembering Test Instructions [0-5], Comprehension[0-5], Word Finding Difficulty [0-5], Spoken Language Ability [0-5], Executive Function [0-5], and Number Cancellation [0-5] test). It is considered to be more sensitive for less impaired populations such as MCI/Prodromal and mild AD participants. The total score ranges from 0 to 90. Higher score indicates more impairment.</description>

          <description>ADAS-cog14 is a psychometric instrument that evaluates 14-items (Immediate Word-recall [0-10], Commands [0-5], Constructional Praxis [0-5], Delayed Word-recall [0-10], Naming Objects/Fingers [0-5], Ideational Praxis [0-5], Orientation[0-8], Word Recognition [0-12], Remembering Test Instructions [0-5], Comprehension[0-5], Word Finding Difficulty [0-5], Spoken Language Ability [0-5], Executive Function [0-5], and Number Cancellation [0-5] test). It is considered to be more sensitive for less impaired populations such as MCI/Prodromal and mild AD participants. The total score ranges from 0 to 90. Higher score indicates more impairment.</description>

        <description>The MMSE is a cognitive instrument commonly used for screening purposes, for staging of disease severity and is often measured longitudinally in AD clinical studies to follow disease progression and treatment effects. MMSE is composed of 30 questions grouped into domains (Orientation to Time [0-5], Orientation to Place [0-5], Registration [0-3], Attention and Calculation [0-5], Recall [0-3], Naming [0-2], Repetition [0-1], Comprehension [0-3], Reading [0-1], Writing [0-1], Drawing [0-1]). For each of the MMSE domains, six items are computed (Orientation to Time [0-5], Orientation to Place [0-5], Registration [0-3], Attention and Calculation [0-5], Recall [0-3], Language: Naming, Repetition, Comprehension, Reading, Writing, and Drawing [0-9]). The MMSE Total Score is the sum of the six domains and ranges from 0 to 30. If any domain score was missing then the total score was missing. Higher score indicates better function.</description>

        <title>Core Phase: Change From Last Dose in the CDR-SB Score</title>
        <description>The CDR scale is a clinical global rating scale that requires interviewing both the participant and an informant who knows and has contact with the participant. The CDR scale is a clinician directed assessment of both cognition and function, and is intended to capture the state and therefore the disease stage of the participant. The CDR scale assesses 6 domains of participant function (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care) on a 5-point scale in which no impairment=0, questionable impairment=0.5, mild impairment=1, moderate impairment=2 and severe impairment=3. The CDR-SB is a sum of the individual domain scores and ranges from 0 to 18. Higher score indicates more impairment.</description>

        <description>ADCOMS is a weighted linear combination of 12 items from three existing clinical scales: the ADAS-cog, the MMSE, and the CDR. Four items are from the ADAS-cog (A4 [Delayed Word Recall], A7 [Orientation], A8 [Word Recognition], A11 [Word Finding]); 2 items are from the MMSE (M1 [Orientation Time], M7 [Drawing]); 6 items are from the CDR (C1 [Personal Care], C2 [Community Affairs], C3 [Home and Hobbies], C4 [Judgment and Problem Solving], C5 [Memory], C6 [Orientation]). Composite score is derived from the variables from the 12 items, and ranges from 0 to 1.97, where higher score indicates worse performance.</description>

        <title>Core Phase: Change From Last Dose in the ADAS-cog14 Score</title>
        <description>ADAS-cog14 is a psychometric instrument that evaluates 14-items (Immediate Word-recall [0 to 10], Commands [0-5], Constructional Praxis [0-5], Delayed Word-recall [0-10], Naming Objects/Fingers [0-5], Ideational Praxis [0-5], Orientation[0-8], Word Recognition [0-12], Remembering Test Instructions [0-5], Comprehension[0-5], Word Finding Difficulty [0-5], Spoken Language Ability [0-5], Executive Function [0-5], and Number Cancellation [0-5] test). It is considered to be more sensitive for less impaired populations such as MCI/Prodromal and mild AD participants. The Total Score ranges from 0 to 90. Higher score indicates more impairment.</description>

        <description>The MMSE is a cognitive instrument commonly used for screening purposes, for staging of disease severity and is often measured longitudinally in AD clinical studies to follow disease progression and treatment effects. MMSE is composed of 30 questions grouped into domains (Orientation to Time [0-5], Orientation to Place [0-5], Registration [0-3], Attention and Calculation [0-5], Recall [0-3], Naming [0-2], Repetition [0-1], Comprehension [0-3], Reading [0-1], Writing [0-1], Drawing [0-1]). For each of the MMSE domains, six items are computed (Orientation to Time [0-5], Orientation to Place [0-5], Registration [0-3], Attention and Calculation [0-5], Recall [0-3], Language: Naming, Repetition, Comprehension, Reading, Writing, and Drawing [0-9]). The MMSE Total Score is the sum of the six domains and ranges from 0 to 30. If any domain score was missing then the total score was missing. Higher score indicates better function.</description>

        <description>The CDR scale is a clinical global rating scale that requires interviewing both the participant and an informant who knows and has contact with the participant. The CDR scale is a clinician directed assessment of both cognition and function, and is intended to capture the state and therefore the disease stage of the participant. The CDR scale assesses 6 domains of participant function (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care) on a 5-point scale in which no impairment=0, questionable impairment=0.5, mild impairment=1, moderate impairment=2 and severe impairment=3. The CDR-SB is a sum of the individual domain scores and ranges from 0 to 18. Higher score indicates more impairment.</description>

        <description>ADCOMS is a weighted linear combination of 12 items from three existing clinical scales: the ADAS-cog, the MMSE, and the CDR. Four items are from the ADAS-cog (A4 [Delayed Word Recall], A7 [Orientation], A8 [Word Recognition], A11 [Word Finding]); 2 items are from the MMSE (M1 [Orientation Time], M7 [Drawing]); 6 items are from the CDR (C1 [Personal Care], C2 [Community Affairs], C3 [Home and Hobbies], C4 [Judgment and Problem Solving], C5 [Memory], C6 [Orientation]). Composite score is derived from the variables from the 12 items, and ranges from 0 to 1.97, where higher score indicates worse performance.</description>

        <title>Extension Phase: Change From Core Phase Baseline up to Month 12 of the Extension Phase in MMSE Score</title>
        <description>The MMSE is a cognitive instrument commonly used for screening purposes, for staging of disease severity and is often measured longitudinally in AD clinical studies to follow disease progression and treatment effects. MMSE is composed of 30 questions grouped into domains (Orientation to Time [0-5], Orientation to Place [0-5], Registration [0-3], Attention and Calculation [0-5], Recall [0-3], Naming [0-2], Repetition [0-1], Comprehension [0-3], Reading [0-1], Writing [0-1], Drawing [0-1]). For each of the MMSE domains, six items are computed (Orientation to Time [0-5], Orientation to Place [0-5], Registration [0-3], Attention and Calculation [0-5], Recall [0-3], Language: Naming, Repetition, Comprehension, Reading, Writing, and Drawing [0-9]). The MMSE Total Score is the sum of the six domains and ranges from 0 to 30. If any domain score is missing then the total score is missing. Higher score indicates better function.</description>

Each item is rated as follows: 0=Normal, 1=Has difficulty but does by self, 2=Requires assistance, 3=Dependent, or 8=Not Applicable. The total score is the sum of all 10 items &amp; ranges from 0 to 30. Higher score indicates more impairment. If any activity was missed, then the total score was missed. Activities rated as &quot;Not Applicable&quot; were not used in the computation of the total score.

    <limitations_and_caveats>This study was terminated early due to an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio including no evidence of potential efficacy and the adverse event profile in participants with drug treatment was worse than that in participants who received placebo. The small sample size at the 24 month time point of the core phase limits the interpretability of the data.</limitations_and_caveats>
