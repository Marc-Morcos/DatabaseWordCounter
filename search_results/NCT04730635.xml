    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the ability of a repeated high-frequency&#xD;
      site-based computerized cognitive assessment to evaluate the potential treatment effects of&#xD;
      donepezil (MK-0000) compared with placebo among participants with mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (MCI) or mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The primary study hypothesis is that the average&#xD;
      percentage of correct responses on one card learning (OCL) task will be ≥2 percentage points&#xD;
      in participants receiving donepezil compared with participants receiving placebo.&#xD;
