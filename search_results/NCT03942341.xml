      RATIONALE of the project. Adults with Down syndrome (DS) present severe sleep disorders that&#xD;
      are under recognized by caregivers. Aging in DS population increases the prevalence of both&#xD;
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Alzheimer´s disease (AD) dementia at much higher rates than&#xD;
      in the general population. AD increases the risk of sleep disturbances and OSA, which in turn&#xD;
      worsen cognitive performance and behavioral function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that adults with DS and AD dementia will present a higher prevalence of&#xD;
      sleep disorders (sleep disruption, sleep circadian disorders and OSA) than in DS without&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no data evaluating nocturnal sleep in adults with DS with AD dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the prevalence of sleep disturbances in adult subjects with&#xD;
      DS and AD dementia, by means of subjective and objectives sleep measures.&#xD;

      Aims To characterize and determine the prevalence of sleep disorders and sleep wake pattern&#xD;
      in a large community-based sample of adult subjects with DS and AD dementia and to correlate&#xD;
      the results with clinical, cognitive and behavioral features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective is to evaluate the impact of AD dementia on sleep in adults with DS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. By evaluating the frequency of sleep problems in demented adults with DS through:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Nocturnal sleep by polysomnography (PSG)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjective sleep quality (Pittsburg) and daytime Somnolence (Epworth)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Sleep-wake pattern by actimetry&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. By analyzing the association between sleep problems and both age and body mass index&#xD;
           (BMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. By analyzing the impact of sleep problems on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Daytime Somnolence (Epworth, actigraphy)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Diurnal Behavioural disturbances&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Neurophysiological performance&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary objective is to compare the sleep data of the DS patients with AD dementia&#xD;
           with our sleep data of DS patients without dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The project is the continuation of our sleep research work in adults with DS. We have&#xD;
           performed a community-based cross-sectional study in 54 adults with DS by means of&#xD;
           objective and subjective measures, and we found a high prevalence of sleep disorders&#xD;
           (Giménez, 2018). In this study, 6 DS patients had AD dementia. Although the sample was&#xD;
           very small, our results show that the symptomatic AD-DS group presented a higher apnea&#xD;
           hypopnea index (AHI), higher oxygen desaturations (ODI-3%), and higher respiratory&#xD;
           arousal index compared to the non demented DS group. The DS group with dementia had also&#xD;
           worse sleep efficiency and higher sleep fragmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Muliticenter sleep study. Cross-sectional analytical study. The study duration is 24&#xD;
           months. Participants: 90 subjects with DS and AD. Only subjects with mild and moderate&#xD;
           mental retardation will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Variables and method of collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Neurological evaluation: Standard visit in which medical and neurological past&#xD;
                medical history will be reviewed to apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Neuropsychological evaluation: The neuropsychological battery will be administered&#xD;
                by neuropsychologists with experience in the evaluation of DS subjects. The study&#xD;
                includes neuropsychological tests that have proven to be sensitive to detect&#xD;
                cognitive impairment and is based, in part, from the recommendations of the&#xD;
                &quot;Working Group for the Establishment of Criteria for the Diagnosis of Dementia in&#xD;
                Individuals with Intellectual Disability.&quot; The complete battery has an approximate&#xD;
                length of 90 min and consists in:&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Functional, daily living activities and neuropsychiatric scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Estimated Intelligence Quotient (IQ): Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Global cognition battery adapted to Intellectual Disabilities: CAMDEX-DS,&#xD;
                including the structured interview CAMDEX-DS and the cognitive battery CAMCOG-DS.&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Memory: The Cued Recall Test (CRT) adapted version (Deveny, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Executive function: Cats and dogs test (adaptation of Day-Night Stroop), to&#xD;
                     measure inhibition capacity and backward digits.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Attention: cancellation test.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Language: semantic fluency test (animals), 30 items from the Boston Naming&#xD;
                     Test (BNT).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Sleep evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants will undergo a full sleep evaluation. This includes a sleep interview&#xD;
           with a sleep specialist, and a subjective and objective evaluation of nocturnal sleep&#xD;
           and the circadian sleep-wake pattern. Nocturnal sleep will be objectively studied by&#xD;
           full video PSG and Sleep/wake pattern will be collected via sleep diaries and&#xD;
           actigraphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c.1. Objective sleep measures: Polysomnography (PSG). Sleep recordings will be performed&#xD;
           in individual, sound-attenuated, temperature-regulated rooms in sleep units in all&#xD;
           groups. Participants will be continuously supervised by qualified technical staff and&#xD;
           recorded on video/audio with the use of an infrared camera. PSGs will start at their&#xD;
           median bedtime as defined by the prospective diary collection, with a recording time of&#xD;
           8 hours. The morning after the PSG nights, all subjects will complete a subjective&#xD;
           questionnaire about their sleep quality in the laboratory. We will compare this&#xD;
           questionnaire with their usual reported sleep quality at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All-night video PSG-recordings include: 1) 19 EEG- channels referenced to averaged&#xD;
           mastoid electrodes (A1-A2) according to the international 10-20 system; 2) 2&#xD;
           electroculographic channels; and 3) 4 surface electromyographic channels: 2 from the&#xD;
           mentalis, one from the right anterior tibialis and one from the left anterior tibialis&#xD;
           in lower limbs; and 4) 6 channels to monitor respiratory function: one for oximetry, 2&#xD;
           for oro-nasal airflow using a thermistor and nasal-cannula, 2 to record&#xD;
           thoraco-abdominal movements by inductance plethysmography, and a microphone at the&#xD;
           suprasternal notch to detect snoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sleep stages will be visually scored for 30-s epochs according to the guidelines of the&#xD;
           American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). Scoring will be performed by an experienced&#xD;
           sleep technologist and later reviewed by an accredited sleep specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Arousals will be defined using AASM criteria. Respiratory variables will include the&#xD;
           apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), defined as the sum of all apneas (&gt; 90% reduction in airflow&#xD;
           for &gt;10 seconds) and all hypopneas (airflow reduction greater than 30% for at 11 least&#xD;
           10 seconds with an oxygen saturation decrease of approximately 3% or a cortical&#xD;
           awakening) per hour of sleep, and mean oxygen saturation during the night (Sp02).&#xD;
           Periodic leg movements and abnormal REM sleep behavior disorder will be defined&#xD;
           according to the International Criteria of Sleep Disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c.2. Actigraphy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the week before the PSG, participants will wear an actigraph in the non-dominant&#xD;
           arm, a method of monitoring human rest/activity cycles. Variables obtained by actimetry&#xD;
           will be analysed in two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Activity analysis: variables describing level of activity and light during 24 hours&#xD;
           and during all period. Includes average of daily activity during all period, maximum&#xD;
           activity times and variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Sleep analysis: to asses sleep variables derived from actigraphy, bedtime and awake&#xD;
           time would be need to know from each subject. These information will be collected&#xD;
           through event marker system of the actimeter and from sleep diaries recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c.3. Subjective Sleep Measures (assessed by caregiver): All participants will have a&#xD;
           notebook that includes subjective sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries to be completed&#xD;
           by the caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sleep questionnaires will include the following scales: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality&#xD;
           Index (PSQI) to assess patients' self-reports of sleep quality; the Epworth Sleepiness&#xD;
           Scale (ESS) to evaluate somnolence (with a modification of the last question about the&#xD;
           DS person as a passenger in a car while stopped for a few minutes in traffic); and the&#xD;
           Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) to identify subjects at risk for the sleep apnea syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sleep diary is a daily report of sleep and waking activities over 24-hour periods. The&#xD;
           sleep diary reports: bedtime, wake time, how much time taken to fall asleep, how much&#xD;
           time spent awake after sleep onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS v23 software. Demographics and sleep&#xD;
           scores will be compared between groups by means of t tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The statistical threshold is set at 0.05. To assess the differences between the various&#xD;
           sleep techniques performed in DS participants, general lineal models (GLM) with one&#xD;
           within-subject factor (techniques, 3 levels) will be applied separately to each sleep&#xD;
           variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For all variables, results will be pair-compared by means of the t-test.&#xD;
           Greenhouse-Geisser correction will be used. The Pearson correlation will be applied to&#xD;
           evaluate the relationship between sleep variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY LIMITATIONS The main foreseen limitation for this study it the heterogeneity of&#xD;
           the DS population. To try to overcome this difficulty and to facilitate the feasibility&#xD;
           of the study, only subjects with mild or mild-moderate mental retardation will be&#xD;
           selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ETHICAL ISSUES The study will be carried out in strict accordance with international&#xD;
           ethical guidelines for medical research in humans. Researchers are responsible for&#xD;
           ensuring that the study is conducted in accordance with standards contained in the&#xD;
           Declaration of Helsinki and local regulation. All participants will be included after&#xD;
           obtaining a written informed consent (the family member's consent will also be&#xD;
           obtained). Before including any subject in the study, the investigator will inform the&#xD;
           participant of the objectives, methods and potential risks of the study or any&#xD;
           inconvenience this may cause. The studies that will be performed in this project are not&#xD;
           part of the routine evaluation of subjects with DS and they have an interest only from a&#xD;
           research point of view. To preserve the confidentiality of information, data pertaining&#xD;
           to this study will not be included in the conventional medical history, but in a&#xD;
           separate file in a protected location.&#xD;
