  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is now established that disturbances in social cognition are frequent in neurology and&#xD;
      that they contribute to the development of social conduct disorders. Their assessment is&#xD;
      therefore essential, particularly in order to propose early and adapted care. However, this&#xD;
      assessment remains limited today. A new serious game-type test, REALSoCog, has been developed&#xD;
      to address the shortcomings of current tools and to highlight disturbances in social&#xD;
      behaviors. The latter are not always observed in consultation although they are often&#xD;
      reported by caregivers. The objective of this research is therefore to validate the REALSoCog&#xD;
      task in a pathological population (currently being standardized in the general population:&#xD;
      CER-U, IRB N°: 00012020-115). The clinical interest of this task will be tested with a group&#xD;
      of patients suffering from a neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia&#xD;
      with Lewy bodies (DCL), fronto-temporal lobar degeneration (FTD)) in order to assess its&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity in the detection of social-cognitive disturbances, and in&#xD;
      particular in terms of social behaviors (detection of social behavioral disorders reported in&#xD;
      daily life). The objective is also to document the socio-cognitive profiles in the mentioned&#xD;
      diseases thanks to a more ecological test, and to better understand the links between&#xD;
      socio-cognitive processes on the one hand, and individual characteristics on the other hand&#xD;
      (e.g. mood and social participation).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>rate of inappropriate behavioural intentions</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour and a half</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured by the REALSoCog task through a question asking the participant to specify his behavioral intention in the case where he would have declared his intention to act in front of the social situation presented. These questions are asked for each social situation presented, i.e. for a total of 16 situations</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Moral cognition</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour and a half</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to detect moral transgressions, the ability to detect conventional transgressions, and the ability to detect control situations (non-transgressive situations) are measured by the question &quot;Does this situation seem appropriate or inappropriate to you?&quot; asked after each REALSoCog situation. The severity judgment of moral transgressions and the severity judgment of conventional transgressions are measured by the question &quot;How inappropriate does it [the situation] seem to you?&quot; asked after each response characterizing the situation presented as inappropriate in REALSoCog.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Empathy and emotional reactivity</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour and a half</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of emotional empathy and the intensity of emotional reactivity are measured by the question &quot;How much are you affected by the situation? This question is asked after each experimental situation of REALSoCog (i.e. situations involving a transgression and situations constructed to elicit empathy), i.e. for 10 situations.&#xD;
The valence and congruence of the emotions felt are measured by the question &quot;The emotion you feel at the sight of this situation is: 1 (very negative) to 5 (very positive)&quot;. This question is asked after each experimental situation of REALSoCog (i.e. situations involving a transgression and situations constructed to elicit empathy), i.e. for 10 situations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of theory of mind</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour and a half</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to detect the intentionality of an action is measured by the question &quot;Is the behavior of the [main protagonist in the situation] intentional? Yes / No&quot;. This question is asked for 5 REALSoCog situations.&#xD;
The ability to characterize the valence of this intention and the average valence of the attributed intentions is measured by the question &quot;In your opinion the intention is: 1 (very malicious) to 5 (very benevolent)&quot;. This question is asked for 5 REALSoCog situations.&#xD;
The ability to infer an affect to others is measured by the question &quot;How does [main protagonist of the situation] feel?&quot;. This question is asked for 8 REALSoCog situations.&#xD;
The intensity of the affect attributed to others is measured by the question &quot;How does [main protagonist of the situation] feel about [subject's response to the previous question]?&quot; This question is asked for 8 REALSoCog situations.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to perform the REALSoCog serious game-type social cognition assessment task developed by the LMC2 laboratory (UR 7536). Their performance will be compared to those of control individuals recruited in parallel (independant clinical study: CER-U, IRB N°: 00012020-115). Participants will be asked to think about 16 social situations (6 control situations and 10 experimental situations) encountered in a virtual environment representing a city. REALSoCog can be used on a laptop computer, without any additional technical device.</description>

    <description>Hetero-questionnaires assessing patients' social behavior will be transmitted to their relative or primary caregiver (Godefroy &amp; le GREFEX, 2008; Gury and Ehrlé, in progress of validation) in order to verify the concurrent validity of REALSoCog. These hetero-questionnaires aim to identify and quantify the presence of social skills and behaviour disorders.</description>
