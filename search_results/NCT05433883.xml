  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea and Alzheimer's disease are both highly prevalent and age-related&#xD;
      chronic disease with significant impacts on global public health. The link between OSA and AD&#xD;
      showed an inter-dependent relationship. Our genetic study showed the expressions of&#xD;
      AD-associated genes (CCL2, IL6, CXCL8, HLA-A, IL1RN) in severe OSA patients. Our&#xD;
      epidemiological study revealed OSA patients were significantly associated with a higher&#xD;
      incidence of AD (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.12) in comparison to non-OSA subjects and treated&#xD;
      OSA patients exhibited a significantly reduced risk of AD (incidence rate ratio: 0.23)&#xD;
      compared with non-treated OSA patients. Possible mechanisms of OSA in contributing to AD are&#xD;
      sleep fragmentation, intermittent hypoxia, intrathoracic swings, and olfactory dysfunction.&#xD;
      The cognitive decline in AD seems progressive and irreversible, by contrast, OSA sharing&#xD;
      similar cognitive impairment is treatable. The purposes of this study are (1) to explore the&#xD;
      relationship and mechanism between OSA and AD, and establish an alarm system as early stage&#xD;
      of AD in OSA patients, (2) to testify the improvement of OSA can feedback to ameliorate&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and modify the process of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research plan to enroll 15 simple snoring patients (apnea/hypopnea &lt;5, control group), 30&#xD;
      severe OSA patients (apnea/hypopnea &gt;30, treatment group), and 15 mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      patients (comparative group). All patients complete Mini-Mental State Examination, peripheral&#xD;
      blood sample for plasma Aβ42, Aβ40, Aβ42/Aβ40, Tau, NfL; amyloid deposit in18F-florbetapir&#xD;
      PET; and Taiwan smell identification test. Thirty severe OSA patients (AHI&gt;30, treatment&#xD;
      group) receive comprehensive upper airway surgery with/without bariatric surgery and repeat&#xD;
      postoperative assessment in polysomnography and aforementioned examinations 1 year later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the study can be used to explore the association between polysomnography and&#xD;
      AD-related examinations, to compare the perioperative changes in polysomnography and&#xD;
      AD-related examinations, to correlate the perioperative changes between polysomnography and&#xD;
      AD-related examinations. The contributions of the study are to clarify the hypothesis: severe&#xD;
      OSA is early stage and one of the etiology contributing to the development of AD, and sleep&#xD;
      surgery improves OSA and consequently modify the process of AD, early detection of cognition&#xD;
      and olfactory function in OSA patients can contribute to diagnosis of early stage AD and&#xD;
      consequently early treatment to modify the development of AD.&#xD;

    <description>Every subject provided a 20-ml venous blood sample (K3 EDTA, lavender-top tube). Samples were collected under non-fasting conditions between 9 AM and 2 PM. The blood samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 20 minutes within half an hour of collection, and then plasma was aliquoted into cryotubes (1 ml per tube) and stored at -80 °C.</description>

    <description>The radiosynthesis of 18F-florbetapir (AV-45) and amyloid PET data acquisition followed the same procedures as previously described . A fixed dose approximate of 10mCi (370 MBq) 18F-florbetapir (AV-45) will be given to each subject. 10-minute image will be acquired 50-60min post injection using a Biograph mMR PET/MR System or PET/CT scanner.</description>

    <description>The TWSIT questionnaire consisted of two questionnaires (test 1 and test 2), which contained the same multi-choice questions but in different sequence. Eight odorants (honey, peach, passion fruit, cantaloupe, lemon, smoked plum, garlic, coffee, jasmine), which are familiar to Taiwanese with a high identification rate (more than 95%), were identified and used in the questionnaires.</description>
