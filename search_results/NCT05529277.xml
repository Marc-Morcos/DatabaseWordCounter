  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia Care Management (DeCM) is an evidence-based model of care in Germany. It has proven&#xD;
      its efficacy and cost-effectiveness. However it has not been implemented into routine care so&#xD;
      far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to implement Dementia Care Management into routine care in a&#xD;
      selected region in Germany and evaluate the process of implementation as well as the effect&#xD;
      of Dementia Care Management on participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited in regular routine care n=60 people with cognitive impairment and/ or their cares&#xD;
      will receive Dementia Care Management provided by specifically trained and qualified dementia&#xD;
      care managers for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be assessed and analysed prior to the implementation, immediately after having&#xD;
      received the intervention and at a later time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the intervention on person-oriented health care outcomes wil be analysed as&#xD;
      well as factors associated with that.&#xD;

    <measure>Antidementia drug treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>A computer-based home medication review (HMR) encompasses all medications used by the study participants and includes questions about compliance, adverse effects and drug administration. The collection of primary data on medication in the context of the HMR includes both prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs. The assignment was then integrated using a master file of the Pharmaceutical Index. The following antidementia drugs will be considered: donepezil (N06AD02), rivastigmine (N06AD03), galantamine (N06AD04) and memantine (N06AX01)</description>

    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; Cummings 1997); The NPI represents an interview by proxy on twelve dimensions of neuropsychiatric behaviors, i.e. delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, night-time behavior disturbances, and appetite and eating abnormalities. The presence (0= no, 1= yes) is asked. If present, the severity (rated 1 through 3; mild to severe) and frequency (1 to 4, rarely to very often) of each neuropsychiatric symptom are rated on. Thus the score for each dimension ranges from 0 = not present, 1= mildly and rarely to 12 = severe and often. A total NPI score is calculated as the sum of the frequency by severity scores ofeach domain range: 0 to 144, the higher the more neuropsychiatric symptomatic).</description>

    <description>The revised version of the Zarit-Burden Inventory (ZBI; Zarit et al., 1980) will be used.The revised version ZBI is a caregiver self-report measure to examine burden which is associated with functional/behavioural impairments and home care situation. It contains 22 items using a 5-point scale. Response options range from 0 (Never) to 4 (Nearly Always).Total scores range from 0 indicating low burden to 88 indicating high burden.</description>

    <description>The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE; Cockrell &amp; Folstein, 1988) will be used. The MMSE is a 30-point questionnaire to measure cognitive impairment. The questions are grouped into seven categories, each representing a different cognitive domain or function: Orientation to time (5 points); Orientation to place (5 points); Registration of three words (3 points); Attention and Calculation (5 points); Recall of three words (3 points); Language (8 points) and Visual Construction (1 point). Scores of 25-30 out of 30 are considered normal; 21-24 as mild, 10-20 as moderate and &lt;10 as severe impairment.</description>
