  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the pilot phase of a longitudinal observational cohort study. The study includes&#xD;
      family clusters comprised of a patient with Alzheimer's disease, an informal caregiver and at&#xD;
      least one first-degree relative of the patient. The family clusters will be followed-up in&#xD;
      expert memory centers and online in order to study risk and prognostic factors (including&#xD;
      blood-based biomarkers) in the first-degree relatives and patients, respectively, as well as&#xD;
      caregiver health, difficulties and needs. This pilot study is performed to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of conducting a larger-scale study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the primary cause of&#xD;
      dementia. It brings about a huge burden for patients, families and society as a whole. There&#xD;
      is currently no curative treatment available, but the existence of a long preclinical period,&#xD;
      during which biomarker changes are observed, and the identification of modifiable risk&#xD;
      factors suggest that AD may be preventable. Data is currently lacking, however, on the&#xD;
      trajectories and predictive value of blood-based biomarkers (which are more acceptable and&#xD;
      less costly to measure than traditional imaging and Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers&#xD;
      biomarkers). Furthermore, although there has been much research into modifiable AD risk&#xD;
      factors, they have often not been studied simultaneously in the same cohort, and there has&#xD;
      been relatively little research into newly identified risk factors, such as hearing&#xD;
      impairment. First-degree relatives of AD patients would seem an ideal population to study&#xD;
      such factors, since they are at increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline, and may be&#xD;
      more motivated to participate in dementia research studies than other individuals. Finally,&#xD;
      although caregiver burden and quality of life have been previously studied, further data is&#xD;
      required on their longitudinal trajectories, particularly taking into account the disease&#xD;
      course of the patients they care for. Caregivers' needs and coping and caregiving strategies&#xD;
      also need to be better understood. In the pilot phase of the ALFA3 study, 150 familial&#xD;
      clusters (each comprised of a patient with Alzheimer's disease, a family caregiver and at&#xD;
      least one first-degree relative of the patient) will be recruited and followed-up for 2 years&#xD;
      in expert memory centers and via online questionnaires. This pilot phase will be used to&#xD;
      study the feasibility of conducting a larger-scale study.&#xD;
