    <measure>The Tinetti Gait and Balance Test (TGBT)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 month</time_frame>
    <description>TGBT consists of balance and gait subheadings. For balance, there are 13 items, and 9 items for gait. Items are scored as 0 (abnormal), 1 (adaptive) and 2 (normal) for balance, 0 (abnormal), 1 (normal) for gait. The maximum balance score of the patient is 26 and the maximum gait score is 9. Total score (balance + walking) is 35 points.</description>

    <measure>Mini Mental State Test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 month</time_frame>
    <description>It was used to determine the cognitive state before the training. The Mini-Mental State Test was first published by Folstein et al. It consists of eleven items under 5 main headings: orientation, record memory, attention and calculation, recall and language, and the total score is evaluated over 30 points.</description>

    <measure>Tampa Scale</measure>

    <description>17 questions is a scale. The scale is used in work-related activities, injury/re-injury and fear-avoidance contains the parameters.</description>

    <measure>The Time Up Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 month</time_frame>
    <description>The timed &quot;Up &amp; Go&quot; measures, in seconds, the time taken by an individual to stand up from a standard arm chair (approximate seat height of 46 cm), walk a distance of 3 meters, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down again.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Gait Speed Measurement Test (GSMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 month</time_frame>
    <description>For GSMT, individuals were asked to walk at a speed they wanted on a flat surface of 14 m. Signs were placed on the 2nd and 12th meters of the test area to minimize the speed changes between walking start and walking finish, and to make a more objective measurement. The walking time at this 10-meter distance was measured with the stopwatch and the results were recorded in sec and the walking speed was determined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fall Risk Self-Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 month</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 13 items assessing the risk of falling in the elderly. The answers are yes (1 point) and no (0 points), and individuals who get 4 points or more from the scoring are classified as having a high risk of falling.</description>
