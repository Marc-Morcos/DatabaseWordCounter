  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effects of oral TRx0014 at three&#xD;
      doses (30, 60 and 100 mg tid) compared with placebo on cognitive ability in patients with&#xD;
      mild or moderate dementia of the Alzheimer type. Cognitive ability will be measured by the&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). The primary evaluation&#xD;
      will be made at 24 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient may be of either sex and must be supervised by a carer who is competent to&#xD;
             ensure compliance with the medication and who is willing to participate in completing&#xD;
             the various assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to give written informed consent to participate in this study.&#xD;
             Patients who lack capacity to consent may not be entered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Competent carer must be available and must provide written consent to his or her own&#xD;
             participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer type determined by Diagnostic and&#xD;
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria and a diagnosis of Probable&#xD;
             Alzheimer's Disease determined by the National Institute of Neurological and&#xD;
             Communicative Disorders and Stroke - Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders&#xD;
             Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. Information to support the diagnosis will include&#xD;
             that derived from:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  an abbreviated Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly Examination (short&#xD;
                  CAMDEX) schedule, performed within six weeks prior to the baseline visit (Visit&#xD;
                  0).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with no time&#xD;
                  limit on previous scans. In centres conducting SPECT/PET scans as part of their&#xD;
                  routine practice or as part of the study these may be used to inform the&#xD;
                  NINCDS-ADRDA diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have mild or moderate dementia as determined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) value at screening of between 10 and 26&#xD;
                  inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Screening blood sample shows that the patient has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase&#xD;
             deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has known hereditary methaemoglobinaemia, has been known to have suffered an&#xD;
             attack of acquired methaemoglobinaemia or has a blood level of methaemoglobin at&#xD;
             screening which is above the upper limit of normal for age and laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has significant impairment of renal, hepatic or haematological function for&#xD;
             the age of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is currently taking other anti-dementia drugs (e.g. memantine, cholinesterase&#xD;
             inhibitors) or has taken these within the previous six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is anticipated that there will be a definite indication for the commencement of&#xD;
             other licensed anti-dementia drug treatment within the 24 week treatment period of the&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has started taking other medication known to have an effect on mood or&#xD;
             cognition (e.g. anticholinergics, hypnotics, sedatives, anxiolytics, neuroleptics,&#xD;
             antidepressants, antiepileptics) within the previous six weeks; or has changed their&#xD;
             dose of these medications within the previous six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has started taking 'alternative therapy' for AD e.g. vitamin E, folic acid,&#xD;
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT), ginkgo biloba within the previous six weeks; or has&#xD;
             changed their dose of these treatments within the previous six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is receiving warfarin or digitalis or any other medication that has a narrow&#xD;
             margin between effective dose and toxic dose or between effective dose and ineffective&#xD;
             dose, where the subject would be at risk if the levels were elevated or fell due to&#xD;
             interaction with TRx0014.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unlikely to comply with trial visit schedule or with trial&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant intercurrent illness which may compromise safety of the patient/validity&#xD;
             of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females with the potential of childbearing and are not using adequate contraception or&#xD;
             females who are breastfeeding.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has participated in a clinical investigation of a medication or device within&#xD;
             the previous three months.&#xD;
