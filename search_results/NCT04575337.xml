  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project of Bio-AD is a population- based cohort study among the elderly in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project includes not only Alzheimer's disease (AD including familial AD and sporadic AD),&#xD;
      but also other clinical stage of AD, as well as elderly people with normal cognitive&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will collect, detect and screen the special biomarkers at different clinical&#xD;
      stage of AD based on body fluid, gene and brain image. The standard and consistent assessment&#xD;
      protocols are employed to obtain clinical, cognitive, genetic, neuroimaging and biospecimen&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to establish a panel of biomarkers which could be used to&#xD;
      diagnose AD at the early stage, and to establish a risk prediction models for AD to predict&#xD;
      the 5-years risk of the onset and progression of AD among elderly population in China.&#xD;

      1. Set up a large population- based cohort including AD, MCI, pre-MCI, other&#xD;
           neurodegenerative diseases, and elderly individuals with normal cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collect the information of clinical and neuropsychological assessment, individual traits&#xD;
           and social environmental factors, and neuroimaging data, as well as the biological&#xD;
           samples, such as peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Screen biomarkers with high specificity and sensitivity from peripheral blood,&#xD;
           cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging to distinguish different clinical stages of AD at&#xD;
           baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Screen the AD-associated gene and their risk variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Establish a panel of AD-specific biomarkers for the preliminary development of&#xD;
           diagnostic kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Identify AD-relevant factors and the special biomarkers to create a preliminary risk&#xD;
           models to predict the onset and progression of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Follow up the cohort for next 5 years and collect the multiple information and&#xD;
           biological samples each year to validate and revise the risk prediction models and the&#xD;
           diagnostic kit of AD.&#xD;
