      This study tests the effectiveness of an in-home intervention to reduce upset and burden&#xD;
      among family caregivers, and decrease nursing home placement. The main hypothesis that will&#xD;
      be tested is that compared to control group, subjects, experimental group participants will&#xD;
      have enhanced well-being and fewer nursing home placements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Implement a multi-component in-home intervention designed to prevent and ameliorate the&#xD;
      troublesome behaviors that families typically confront and that often trigger nursing home&#xD;
      placement. The intervention combines the most effective strategies that have been identified&#xD;
      in previous caregiver research by the investigative team and best clinical practices to&#xD;
      provide a comprehensive service approach to families and individuals with dementia including&#xD;
      education, skills training, home safety, and stress management. To enhance its applicability&#xD;
      to real-world practice within the aging service network, the intervention is designed to be&#xD;
      reproducible and its components and treatment goals commensurate with the Medicaid Waiver&#xD;
      Program. In the absence of evidence-based service protocols currently in place for this&#xD;
      Waiver population, the intervention, if effective, would provide a systematic, evidence-based&#xD;
      approach in the Medicaid Waiver program to help families and persons with dementia remain at&#xD;
      home and in their communities.&#xD;

             occurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             past 12 months, are in treatment for life-threatening cancer, have schizophrenia or a&#xD;
             bipolar disorder, have dementia secondary to head trauma, have a MMSE score = 0 and&#xD;
             are bed-bound (defined as confinement to bed or chair for at least 22 hours a day for&#xD;
             at least four of the previous seven days); or they are enrolled in a clinical trial of&#xD;
             pharmacological treatment for agitation. Also, the dyad will be excluded if the CG had&#xD;
             more than 3 hospitalizations within the past 12 months or is in treatment for&#xD;
             life-threatening cancer; is involved in another clinical trial of psychosocial or&#xD;
             educational interventions for caregivers; or plans to place their family member in a&#xD;
