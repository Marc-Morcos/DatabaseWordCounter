      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of periodontal therapy in in&#xD;
      subjects with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate AD dementia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled study that will assess the effects of periodontal therapy in&#xD;
      subjects with probable AD dementia according to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Association (NIA-AA) criteria. The study will enroll approximately 190 generally healthy male&#xD;
      and female subjects ≥55 and ≤80 years of age. Enrolled subjects must have a documented&#xD;
      diagnosis of mild to moderate AD dementia. The subject should not have other conditions or&#xD;
      brain imaging abnormalities that can explain the symptoms of dementia. All subjects will be&#xD;
      encouraged to have LPs (during screening, week 28 and week 52) in the absence of medical&#xD;
      conditions that can increase the risk of the procedure in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
      Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood will be analyzed for measurements of biomarkers of AD and&#xD;
      neuroinflammation, PiB-PET will be done for assessment of AD. A subset of sites will monitor&#xD;
      subjects for clinical evidence of periodontitis at baseline, 28 and 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase of up to 8 weeks, a treatment phase of&#xD;
      up to 52 weeks, and a safety follow-up phase of 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Mean change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 11 (ADAS-Cog 11) from baseline to the end of treatment period. ADAS-Cog 11 measures cognitive functions and non-cognitive functions such as mood and behavior. Total scores range from 0-70, with higher scores (≥ 18) indicating greater cognitive impairment. ADAS-Cog 11 score increases by 2-4 points per year on average in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. A treatment period of 52 weeks was selected to allow sufficient time to demonstrate at least 2.5 points difference between active treatment and placebo on ADAS-Cog 11 at the end of the treatment period.</description>
