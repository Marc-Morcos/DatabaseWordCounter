    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of toxic proteins in the brain.&#xD;
      Mechanisms to remove these proteins have been the target of many drug trials. This study is&#xD;
      designed to use a device to entrain brain waves to a specific frequency to see if rodent&#xD;
      research can be replicated in humans with mild cognitive impairment. Ten participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from the Emory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) database and assigned to&#xD;
      either treatment for 8 weeks or treatment for 4 weeks. This latter group will serve as the&#xD;
      control group (4 weeks no treatment, 4 weeks treatment). It is hypothesized that exposure to&#xD;
      the gamma oscillations (Flicker) will clear toxic proteins from the brain and increase&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a looming epidemic, with an urgent need for new therapies to&#xD;
      delay or prevent symptom onset and progression. There is growing awareness that clinical&#xD;
      trials must target stage-appropriate pathophysiological mechanisms to effectively develop&#xD;
      disease-modifying treatments. Advances in AD biomarker research have demonstrated changes in&#xD;
      amyloid, brain metabolism, and other pathophysiologies prior to the onset of memory loss,&#xD;
      with some markers possibly changing one or two decades earlier. The brain region responsible&#xD;
      for spatial navigation and memories of experience, the hippocampus, is one of the areas first&#xD;
      affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other memory disorders. Prior research has shown how&#xD;
      coordinated electrical activity across many neurons in the hippocampus represents memories of&#xD;
      experiences and this coordinated activity fails in animal models of AD. The research also&#xD;
      showed that stimulating neurons to produce a specific component of this activity, called&#xD;
      gamma oscillations, reduces AD pathology. The goal of this proposal is to translate this&#xD;
      discovery that stimulating specific patterns of neural activity is neuroprotective from&#xD;
      rodents to humans using a non-invasive approach. This research includes preclinical testing&#xD;
      that will be used to design and justify a multi-site clinical trial to test this approach as&#xD;
      a treatment for AD, for which there are currently no effective therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognito Therapeutics has licensed the technology from prior animal research to transition&#xD;
      this work to humans. The company will provide the Flicker devices for conducting this study.&#xD;
      The device is similar to sunglasses and is both comfortable and easy to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten participants with mild cognitive impairment will be randomly assigned to two study arms.&#xD;
      Although all participants will receive Flicker exposure, half of the participants will&#xD;
      receive the exposure during the entire intervention period (8 weeks of Flicker) while the&#xD;
      other half of the participants will receive Flicker exposure only during the second half of&#xD;
      the intervention period (for 4 weeks of active treatment). During the course of the study,&#xD;
      participants will undergo venous blood draws and lumbar puncture for biomarker analyses at&#xD;
      baseline, midpoint and at the end of the intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Maximum Tolerated Stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated their tolerance to Flicker stimulation prior to the study intervention, using a 1 - 5 point Likert scale for each of the 10 levels of brightness (visual stimulation) and each of the 10 levels of loudness (auditory stimulation) after 60 seconds of stimulation at each level. A rating of 1 indicated stimulation &quot;can be withstood and comfortable,&quot; 3 indicated stimulation is &quot;tolerable, but not necessarily comfortable,&quot; and 5 indicated stimulation &quot;cannot be withstood or is uncomfortable.&quot; Ratings of 1, 2, and 3 were considered tolerable. After determining tolerance for auditory and visual stimulation separately, participants were exposed to combined visual and auditory levels beginning one level above the participant's highest stimulation that received a rating of 3 or lower. Tolerability of brightness and loudness levels of combined auditory stimulation was assessed for 60 seconds. See Analysis Population Description for more details.</description>

    <description>The Flicker intervention is delivered with the GammaSense Stimulation System by Cognito Therapeutics and involves viewing flickering lights at gamma frequency (like a strobe light but faster) to drive gamma oscillations in visual brain areas. The GammaSense Stimulation System is a device consisting of a pair of opaque glasses with a light-emitting diode (LED) illumination on the interior of the glasses. Headphones worn by the user during the stimulation session provide the auditory stimulation. When activated for the treatment session, the device will generate light and sound oscillations at 40 cycles per second (Hz) for 60 minutes. Participants will use the device daily during their active treatment period.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Maximum Tolerated Stimulation</title>
        <description>Participants rated their tolerance to Flicker stimulation prior to the study intervention, using a 1 - 5 point Likert scale for each of the 10 levels of brightness (visual stimulation) and each of the 10 levels of loudness (auditory stimulation) after 60 seconds of stimulation at each level. A rating of 1 indicated stimulation &quot;can be withstood and comfortable,&quot; 3 indicated stimulation is &quot;tolerable, but not necessarily comfortable,&quot; and 5 indicated stimulation &quot;cannot be withstood or is uncomfortable.&quot; Ratings of 1, 2, and 3 were considered tolerable. After determining tolerance for auditory and visual stimulation separately, participants were exposed to combined visual and auditory levels beginning one level above the participant's highest stimulation that received a rating of 3 or lower. Tolerability of brightness and loudness levels of combined auditory stimulation was assessed for 60 seconds. See Analysis Population Description for more details.</description>
