      We followed a pretest-posttest non-equivalent control group experimental design study&#xD;
      comparing two cohorts of patient with different types of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 250 patients will be screened to achieve 240 participants, divided in two&#xD;
      cohorts (120 each), furthermore each cohorts was divided in other two groups (experimental&#xD;
      group (60 each) and control group (60 each) the first one followed up by private centres in&#xD;
      Spain endowed with Occupational Therapy and the second by public centres in the region of&#xD;
      Modena.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The course of dementia goes through different stages and during the moderate and advanced&#xD;
      stages cognitive decline and functional deterioration are frequently accompanied by the&#xD;
      so-called behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), that put severe stress&#xD;
      on the persons with dementia (PwD), on their families and on the health system. Worldwide&#xD;
      consensus guidelines recommend non-pharmacological approaches to be first line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occupational therapist studies human activity as a therapeutic resource to prevent and&#xD;
      treat physical and/or psychosocial difficulties, in order to improve the person's quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were not randomly assigned to different treatment groups (control group and&#xD;
      experimental group); instead, consecutive sampling was chosen by assigning subjects based on&#xD;
      an odd-and-even-numbered technique (odd subjects were assigned to the control group and even&#xD;
      subjects to the experimental group). Both groups presented the same pathological, cultural,&#xD;
      and sexual characteristics, and belonged to the same age group.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinetti</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>- The Tinetti test has been recommended and widely used in the elderly to assess mobility, balance and gait, and predict falls. Different versions can be found. A systematic literature search identified 37 publications on the Tinetti test and falls.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>CDR</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>- The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) has demonstrated high validity and reliability for this purpose, but it requires a considerable amount of data to be collected both from the patient and from an informant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MMSE</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>- The MMSE fulfilled its original goal of providing a brief screening test that quantitatively assesses the severity of cognitive impairment and documents cognitive changes occurring over time</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>NPI</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>- The NPI-Q Spanish version offers the possibility to use a reliable and brief instrument that can be used as a screening in the evaluation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia and associated caregiver distress</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>- Evidence suggests that (Barthel Index) BI is a valid measure of activities of daily living; sensitivity to change is limited at extremes of disability (floor and ceiling effects), and reliability of standard BI assessment is acceptable</description>
