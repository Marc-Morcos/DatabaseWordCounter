  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF) is performing this research to study different&#xD;
      conditions and diseases by using cells from the body (such as skin or blood cells). NYSCF&#xD;
      uses these samples to make stem cells and other types of cells, conduct research on the&#xD;
      samples, perform genetic testing, and/or store these samples for future use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this research, scientists hope to identify future treatments or even cures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at NYSCF study diverse diseases, conditions, and traits by creating &quot;pluripotent&quot;&#xD;
      stem cells. These stem cells can become any cell in the human body, including cells that may&#xD;
      be difficult, invasive, or even impossible to obtain directly. For example, researchers may&#xD;
      create pancreatic insulin-producing cells to learn more about type 1 diabetes, or brain cells&#xD;
      to learn more about Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, researchers perform genetic testing to learn more about DNA, a material in most&#xD;
      cells that contains instructions for the body's development and functions (such as traits&#xD;
      like eye color and risk of certain diseases). A piece of DNA that determines the specific&#xD;
      role of a cell is called a &quot;gene.&quot; If the instructions in a gene are abnormal, this can lead&#xD;
      to disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study involves: (1) completion of a health questionnaire, (2) providing&#xD;
      a skin and/or blood sample from which stem cells may be created, (3) possible collection of a&#xD;
      saliva sample for genetic analysis, and (4) possible future follow-up to provide additional&#xD;
      information or learn about other research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is not a clinical trial.&#xD;

          -  For skin samples collected specifically for this study: history of keloid formation,&#xD;
             bleeding disorder, allergy to the anesthetic, or anticoagulation use that precludes&#xD;
