  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe alterations of brain networks connectivity have been described in Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (AD). Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has gained evidence as an effective&#xD;
      tool to modulate brain networks connectivity, leading to a recovery or reorganization of both&#xD;
      local and remote brain regions functionally connected to the stimulated area. The&#xD;
      investogators propose an innovative tailored network-based rTMS treatment to ameliorate&#xD;
      cognitive symptoms in mild AD, through the boosting of connectivity within brain networks&#xD;
      affected by AD pathophysiology. The combination of the proposed intervention with an&#xD;
      integrated multi-modal imaging approach will allow to evaluate the neural mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the clinical response to the treatment and to define quantitative markers of&#xD;
      clinical impact on AD. If successful, the present proposal would immediately impact on&#xD;
      patient's quality of life, with important implications for the time and costs of delivery of&#xD;
      rehabilitative services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, no effective cure is available for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has gained increasing attention as a potential&#xD;
      treatment for various neurological and psychiatric disorders, but available rTMS studies are&#xD;
      flawed by inaccurate anatomical targeting, inadequate sample size, unsatisfactory controls&#xD;
      and lacking blindness. To date, the elective target area of rTMS interventions in AD has been&#xD;
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a core area of the Central Executive network&#xD;
      (CEN), which plays a key role in regulating executive functions, attention and working&#xD;
      memory. While the CEN has recently been described as dysfunctional in AD, AD pathophysiology&#xD;
      has been mainly associated with the breakdown of the Default Mode network (DMN) and with&#xD;
      structural disconnection of its parietal nodes. The DMN plays a crucial role in episodic&#xD;
      memory retrieval and incorporates various brain regions, among which parietal areas are&#xD;
      highly connected with the rest of the brain. The present multicenter, double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized and placebo-controlled study has the ambition to provide evidence of the efficacy&#xD;
      of two tailored network-based rTMS treatments in mild AD, through the enhancement of&#xD;
      connectivity of CEN and DMN. Innovative integrated multi-modal imaging investigations will&#xD;
      further enrich this proposal allowing to identify quantifiable markers underlying the&#xD;
      clinical impact of rTMS on AD.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After recruitment, patients will be randomized and assigned to one of three rTMS treatments: DMN (N=20), CEN (N=20) or placebo (N=20). The rTMS treatment will consist of 2 phases: an intensive phase and a maintenance phase. The intensive phase will involve 3 weeks of treatment, 5 days per week (15 sessions in total). The maintenance will consist of 1 session of treatment every 2 weeks for 5 months (10 sessions in total). Overall, the patients will undergo 25 sessions of rTMS delivered over 6 months. At baseline (T0), at the end of the intensive phase (T1) and at the end of the maintenance phase (T2) all patients will undergo a clinical and cognitive assessment and a multi-modal imaging data collection.</intervention_model_description>
