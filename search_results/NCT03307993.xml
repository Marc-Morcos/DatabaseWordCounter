        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has probable AD diagnosed according to National Institute of Neurological&#xD;
             and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's disease and Related&#xD;
             Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has had a positive amyloid PET scan, which in the opinion of the principal&#xD;
             investigator is consistent with a diagnosis of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at screening of at least&#xD;
             15 and no greater than 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a knowledgeable and reliable caregiver who will accompany the patient&#xD;
             to all clinic visits during the study and answer questions about the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is a man or woman of at least 50 years of age and has a body mass index&#xD;
             (BMI) ≥ 18.5 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has evidence of any clinically significant neurodegenerative disease, or&#xD;
             other serious neurological disorders other than AD including but not limited to Lewy&#xD;
             body dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease,&#xD;
             major cortical stroke, major head trauma, primary or secondary cerebral neoplasia or&#xD;
             systemic medical diseases that are, in the investigator's opinion, likely to affect&#xD;
             central nervous system functioning and may influence the outcome or analysis of the&#xD;
             scan results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is, in the investigator's opinion, unlikely to comply with the protocol or&#xD;
             is unsuitable for any reason.&#xD;
