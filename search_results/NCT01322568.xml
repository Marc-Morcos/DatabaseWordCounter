      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers are interested in studying the environmental and genetic factors that play a&#xD;
      role in health and living conditions as people age. Since 2002, the U.S. National Institute&#xD;
      on Aging and the Icelandic Heart Association Research Institute have been conducting a&#xD;
      long-term study known as the Research in Aging project to collect personal data and samples&#xD;
      from Icelandic men and women in order to study risk factors related to disease and disability&#xD;
      in old age. Researchers plan to initiate a second stage of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect additional personal information, medical records, and blood samples from&#xD;
      individuals who have previously provided materials for the Research in Aging Project in&#xD;
      Iceland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals who have previously participated in the Research in Aging project in&#xD;
      association with the U.S. National Institute on Aging and the Icelandic Heart Association&#xD;
      Research Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a physical examination with imaging analysis procedures and&#xD;
           hearing and eye tests, provide information on health and diet, and provide a 100-ml&#xD;
           blood sample for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also provide consent for researchers to consult data and samples&#xD;
           collected during the first stage of the Research on Aging project.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In anticipation of the sequencing of the human genome and description of the human proteome,&#xD;
      the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES) was initiated in 2002. AGES&#xD;
      was designed to examine risk factors, including genetic susceptibility and gene/environment&#xD;
      interaction, in relation to disease and disability in old age. The study is&#xD;
      multidisciplinary, providing detailed phenotypes related to the cardiovascular,&#xD;
      neurocognitive (including sensory), and musculoskeletal systems, and to body composition and&#xD;
      metabolic regulation. Relevant quantitative traits, subclinical indicators of disease, and&#xD;
      medical diagnoses are identified by using biomarkers, imaging, and other physiologic&#xD;
      indicators. The AGES sample is drawn from an established population-based cohort, the&#xD;
      Reykjavik Study. This cohort of men and women born between 1907 and 1935 has been followed in&#xD;
      Iceland since 1967 by the Icelandic Heart Association. The AGES cohort, with cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factor assessments earlier in life and detailed late- life phenotypes of quantitative&#xD;
      traits, will create a comprehensive study of aging nested in a relatively genetically&#xD;
      homogeneous older population. This approach should facilitate identification of genetic&#xD;
      factors that contribute to healthy aging as well as the chronic conditions common in old age.&#xD;
