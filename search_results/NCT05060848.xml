  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hydrogen sulfide is a signaling molecule that is important for vascular health. Because&#xD;
      vascular factors such as hypertension and high cholesterol are risk factors for Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease and related dementias, we hypothesize that hydrogen sulfide plays an important role&#xD;
      in brain health as well. We will compare blood levels of hydrogen sulfide across groups of&#xD;
      people with and without dementia. We will also look at the relationship between hydrogen&#xD;
      sulfide, cognitive dysfunction and measures of brain microvascular disease examine the&#xD;
      contribution of hydrogen sulfide to cognitive decline. Our goal is to identify a biomarker of&#xD;
      vascular dysfunction in dementia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have described hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a signaling molecule important in vascular&#xD;
      homeostasis, as a biomarker of cardiovascular disease. There is accumulating evidence that&#xD;
      vascular factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes are&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).&#xD;
      Furthermore, in the brain, H2S acts as a neurotransmitter/second messenger produced following&#xD;
      nerve excitation. It also modulates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors during long term&#xD;
      potentiation for memory consolidation. Three biochemical forms of reactive sulfur pools&#xD;
      exist: free H2S, acid-labile (e.g. iron-sulfur clusters) and bound sulfide (e.g. persulfides,&#xD;
      polysulfides). We hypothesize that H2S becomes dysregulated in ADRD, where vascular and&#xD;
      cognitive functions are linked. We will use analytical biochemical methods to measure plasma&#xD;
      H2S and its metabolites, and 3T MRI to evaluate indicators of microvascular disease in ADRD.&#xD;
      We will compare H2S levels in people with and without cognitive dysfunction consistent with&#xD;
      ADRD, and determine the specificity and sensitivity of H2S indistinguishing people with and&#xD;
      without cognitive dysfunction. In addition, because previous studies report differences in&#xD;
      the incidence and prevalence of ADRD by race and sex, we will compare outcomes across these&#xD;
      groups as well. Finally, we will examine the potentially mediating role of H2S in the&#xD;
      relationship between cognitive function and microvascular disease.&#xD;
