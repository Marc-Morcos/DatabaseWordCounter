  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States and around the world, people are living longer lives. As the population&#xD;
      ages, so does the number of older adults who may experience declines in memory, attention,&#xD;
      reasoning, or other thinking skills. Some of these changes in cognition can be treated and&#xD;
      reversed if caught early. Others can be slowed down and hopefully one day prevented.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, people with cognitive decline or very mild dementia often are not recognized&#xD;
      until late in the disease course when treatments are less effective. As the first health care&#xD;
      professional most people reach out to about medical concerns, primary care providers play a&#xD;
      critical role in detecting cognitive decline early. While many primary care providers conduct&#xD;
      cognitive screening at Medicare Annual Wellness Visits and when patients voice concerns, 9&#xD;
      out of 10 would like more information about who to screen, which assessment tool to use, and&#xD;
      what to say if screening is positive. Deciding who to screen with a brief cognitive&#xD;
      assessment tool is a key part of the process because not everyone needs to be screened, and&#xD;
      primary care providers already face time pressures to address the obvious and immediate&#xD;
      concerns of their patients. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a risk&#xD;
      assessment and cognitive screening tool that requires minimal time and effort from primary&#xD;
      care providers or their staff and is sensitive to cognitive decline in older adults from&#xD;
      diverse educational and racial/ethnic backgrounds. The tool will be integrated into&#xD;
      electronic health record systems to make it easy for primary care providers and patients to&#xD;
      see results. The specific aims of the first phase of the project are to modify an existing&#xD;
      dementia risk screening index to identify older adults who are at high-risk for cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, develop a brief cognitive assessment tool using tasks that are easy for older&#xD;
      adults to perform yet are sensitive to cognitive decline, confirm their utility in 150 people&#xD;
      with varying levels of cognitive abilities that have already been well defined, and test ways&#xD;
      to integrate findings into the electronic health record. The specific aims for the second&#xD;
      phase are to further test the effectiveness of the newly developed tool in 250 older adults&#xD;
      receiving care in a primary care clinic, to find out from primary care providers using the&#xD;
      tool how much they liked it and if it was useful and easy to use, and to integrate findings&#xD;
      into multiple electronic health record systems. Findings from this project will fill a gap in&#xD;
      the existing toolkit of primary care providers and will make screening for cognitive decline&#xD;
      quick, easy, and effective.&#xD;
