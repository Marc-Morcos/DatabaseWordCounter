  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Georgetown University Memory Disorders Program, part of the Department of Neurology, is&#xD;
      conducting pilot studies of the feasibility of various diagnostic tests for Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, mild cognitive impairment and other neurodegenerative diseases. Further, this study&#xD;
      is assessing longitudinal changes in biological, lifestyle, and cognitive assessment&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to examine the feasibility of biochemical assays, genetic&#xD;
      testing, and cognitive and lifestyle assessments in the ante-mortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, mild cognitive impairment and other neurodegenerative diseases. This research&#xD;
      involves genetic and cognitive status testing but the findings will not be shared with&#xD;
      research subjects. This will be accomplished ex vivo using blood, and/or cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF) specimens from patients with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, or other neurodegenerative diseases and from normal controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      These studies will examine the feasibility of using various biochemical assays in blood,&#xD;
      and/or cerebrospinal fluid, genetic testing, cognitive status assessments, and lifestyle&#xD;
      questionnaires to aid in the ante-mortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects have 2 options for participation. They may solely participate in the main study or&#xD;
      the main study and the longitudinal substudy. The main study includes a single visit at which&#xD;
      demographic and medical information will be recorded, brief cognitive testing, and blood&#xD;
      and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)(optional) specimens will be collected for the research&#xD;
      assays. Genetic testing will take place. No clinical laboratory testing will be done and no&#xD;
      results will be communicated to subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Longitudinal substudy, each subject will be asked to participate in ongoing&#xD;
      longitudinal study visits at which demographic and medical information will be recorded,&#xD;
      cognitive testing and lifestyle questionnaire collection will occur, and blood and/or&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens will be collected for the research assays. I&#xD;
&#xD;
      If one is eligible and agrees to participate in the longitudinal sub-study, they will be&#xD;
      asked to come into the clinic for an Initial Study Visit, and then return every year or every&#xD;
      other year, depending on which group they fit into (Cognitively Normal (CN), Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), other neurodegenerative disease) for ongoing&#xD;
      Follow-Up Clinic Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CN participants will come into the clinic every other year, with telephone checks occurring&#xD;
      on alternating years, until the study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCI, AD, and other participants with a diagnosis of any other neurodegenerative disease will&#xD;
      come into the clinic every year until the study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those in the Cognitively Normal group, will also partake in a short Telephone Visit on the&#xD;
      year that they do not come into the clinic. This phone call will be done only to&#xD;
      assess/update your medical history and medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic testing will take place. No clinical laboratory testing will be done and no results&#xD;
      will be communicated to subjects. Those who are deemed to be cognitively normal, assessed by&#xD;
      cognitive status instruments, will be asked to return to the clinic for ongoing study visits&#xD;
      every other year, with telephone visits on the off year. Those who have a diagnosis of MCI,&#xD;
      AD, or any other neurodegenerative disease will be asked to return to the clinic yearly for&#xD;
      their longitudinal follow-up study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both the main and longitudinal sub-study, specimens will be banked for future use and can&#xD;
      be provided to other researchers at Georgetown University, other institutions or commercial&#xD;
      enterprise in a de-identified manner through a formal request system. For all investigators,&#xD;
      not affiliated with the Memory Disorders Program, a formal request will be submitted to the&#xD;
      PI for review. If the request is approved, requested specimens and/or data from the study&#xD;
      will be sent in a de-identified manner to ensure date security and privacy. The reason for&#xD;
      the option of data sharing is to enhance exploration of different lines of analysis, and&#xD;
      assist emerging investigators with access to a database with robust data and specimen&#xD;
      collections.&#xD;
