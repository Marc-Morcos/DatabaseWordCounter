  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is much more common in the elderly than in the young; the&#xD;
      latest studies show prevalence between 45% and 62% in individuals over 60. It is even higher&#xD;
      in patients with dementia such as Alzheimer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several trials in elderly patients showed modified cognitive functions, particularly&#xD;
      executive and attentional functions, in patients with respiratory sleep disorder. However the&#xD;
      benefit of CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) ventilation for Alzheimer patients is&#xD;
      still controversial, as there are few studies documenting its effects on dementia patients'&#xD;
      cognitive abilities, and clinicians appear reluctant to prescribe this type of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators must keep in mind that Alzheimer patients suffer significant sleep&#xD;
      disorders; advanced- stage patients spend 40% of the night awake and are drowsy a large part&#xD;
      of the day. In dementia patients, sleep disorder is a major cause of hospitalization and&#xD;
      institutionalization. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in this population is&#xD;
      estimated at over 50%, and appears to be higher the more advanced the dementia. Trials on&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea syndromes in Alzheimer patients show significatively improved scores&#xD;
      on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), as well as satisfactory treatment tolerance. However, any&#xD;
      impact on cognitive abilities has yet to be demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, cardiovascular pathologies such as arterial hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias,&#xD;
      and strokes are strongly correlated to OSA. In light of its consequences on morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, OSA should be considered a public health issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the investigators wish to address the impact of CPAP treatment&#xD;
      implementation on the cognitive parameters of patients diagnosed with OSA, particularly on&#xD;
      their executive functions. This should provide evidence for mid-term assessment of the&#xD;
      benefits of CPAP in caring for elderly patients with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the prevalence of obstructive sleep pathologies in elderly patients reported in&#xD;
      various studies and of the potential impact of CPAP treatment on cognitive abilities, the&#xD;
      investigators propose a study to evaluate the impact of OSA treatment on elderly Alzheimer&#xD;
      patients' cognitive abilities, particularly on their executive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Executive functions are a rather heterogenous group of high-level cognitive processes which&#xD;
      enable individuals to adopt a flexible, context-appropriate behavior. They also include&#xD;
      planning abilities, working memory, cognitive control, abstract thought, rule learning,&#xD;
      selective attention, motor response selection, etc... Executive functions are mainly&#xD;
      associated to the functioning of the brain's frontal lobes, although subcortical structures&#xD;
      also play a role. When the executive functions are affected by disease, daily life is&#xD;
      significantly impeded as the individual becomes unable to perform complex tasks or regulate&#xD;
      his/her behavior. Many tests can help evaluate these functions in dementia patients. A number&#xD;
      of &quot;ecological&quot; tests, such as the zoo map test from the Behavioural Assessment of the&#xD;
      Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS) arsenal, are quite relevant for evaluating executive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to improve the daily life of Alzheimer patients with sleep apnea by&#xD;
      improving their executive cognitive functions through CPAP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Paquid's trial, there are 12,400 Alzheimer patients in the French Loire&#xD;
      department. [27] The study population will therefore be recruited in the &quot;La Charité&quot; center&#xD;
      of CHU Saint-Etienne. The target population is older individuals (≥ 65) suffering from&#xD;
      cognitive disorders similar to Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSA will be diagnosed based on polysomnography, on an outpatient basis. Apnea patients will&#xD;
      receive CPAP treatment for 4 months, which is the minimum duration required to implement and&#xD;
      accept treatment, and to measure its impact on patients' neurocognitive abilities.&#xD;

      This study's originality lies in that the target population is elderly and has been diagnosed&#xD;
      with both Alzheimer's disease and sleep apnea, and in that it focuses on the impact of&#xD;
      treatment on these patient's cognitive abilities, particularly on their executive&#xD;
      abilities.We aim to provide practitioners with evidence-based arguments for screening and&#xD;
      treating sleep apnea in dementia patients in order to care for these patients, whose&#xD;
      treatment options are often scarce.&#xD;

The consideration of these tests separately has no interest. The sum of these tests is important.</description>
