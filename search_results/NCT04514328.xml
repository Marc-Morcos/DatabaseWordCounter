  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Alzheimer's Plan 2008-2012 allowed the installation of therapeutic gardens for the&#xD;
      structures welcoming patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) . The physical, psychological and&#xD;
      social benefits are the improvement of the state of health and overall well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a positive role in social interactions for patients with AD who can walk in the&#xD;
      therapeutic gardens. Indeed, this promotes meetings with caregives and other people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the garden decreases the stress level in patients (Ulrich). The therapeutic garden&#xD;
      named &quot;art, memory and life&quot; in NANCY is based on art, nature and regional culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This garden can break with the &quot;artificial&quot; framework of care services often perceived as&#xD;
      stressful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the garden, people walk around and have an experience that could improve self-image&#xD;
      perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical study with 2 groups of AD patients hospitalized in UCC or Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Unit took place in Nancy. The evaluation of the QCS (questionnaire on self-awareness) was&#xD;
      carried out at the beginning and at the end of the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a group of patients went into the garden: the QCS score increased&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a group of patients did not go to the garden (they remained in UCC): the QCS score&#xD;
           decreased&#xD;
