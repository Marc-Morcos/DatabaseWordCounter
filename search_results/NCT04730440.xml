      This study aims to evaluate impacts of an emotion recognition rehabilitation program, named&#xD;
      Training of Affect Recognition, on social cognition abilities in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In&#xD;
      addition, we hypothesis that the effect of this rehabilitation will also evolve gaze&#xD;
      strategies, behavioral disorders, and the caregiver's burden.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is commonly admitted that social cognition impairment, like deficit in facial emotion&#xD;
      recognition or misinterpretation of others' intentions (Theory of Mind), are associated with&#xD;
      social behavior disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This kind of disorders are observed in Fronto-Temporal Dementia, Alzheimer's Dementia (AD)&#xD;
      and Parkinson's Disease, with severe deficits in FTD and lighter deficits in AD and PD. One&#xD;
      explanation is that patients apply inappropriate visual exploration strategies to decode&#xD;
      emotions and intentions of others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to evaluate impacts of an emotion recognition rehabilitation program, named&#xD;
      Training of Affect Recognition, on social cognition abilities (facial emotion recognition&#xD;
      (FER) and theory of mind (ToM)) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, we hypothesis that&#xD;
      the effect of this rehabilitation will also evolve gaze strategies, behavioral disorders, and&#xD;
      the caregiver's burden.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Facial emotion recognition (FER) performances</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 6; 1 month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline and Comparison of FER performance between AD-TAR group and AD-Cognitive Stimulation group.&#xD;
Evaluation criteria: Scores to Ekman Faces task (1976) and time to answer. FER was assessed using pictures from the Ekman Faces task (1976), to test the recognition of the six facial basic emotions and neutral faces. There were four pictures per emotion, for a total of 28. For each picture, participants were asked to select one of the seven labels (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, surprise and neutral), with a maximum of 8 seconds of response time per picture.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Affective ToM performances</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 6; 1 month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline and Comparison of Affective ToM performance between AD-TAR group and AD-Cognitive Stimulation group.&#xD;
Evaluation criteria: Scores to the &quot; Reading the Mind in the Eyes &quot; test (Baron-Cohen 2001). 36 black-and-white photographs of the eye area of faces. Subjets are asked to choose which word, among four options, best described what the character in the photograph was thinking or feeling. For this task, four scores were obtained: a total score (/36) and three emotional valence sub-scores: positive (/8), neutral (/16) and negative (/12).</description>

    <measure>Eye gaze strategies during Facial emotion recognition (FER)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 6; 1 month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline and Comparison of gaze patterns between AD-TAR group and AD-Cognitive Stimulation group, during Facial emotion recognition tasks.&#xD;
Evaluation criteria: Eye movements (number and duration of fixations on areas of interest) recorded with an eye-tracking device. FER was assessed using some pictures from the Ekman Faces task (1976).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral disorders</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 6; 1 month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline and Comparison between AD-TAR group and AD-Cognitive Stimulation group, Evaluation criteria: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), a scale that includes ten behavioral items (delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability and aberrant motor behaviors) and two neurovegetative symptoms (sleep and appetite disorders). The evaluation was based on an interview with patients' primary caregivers. Both the frequency (/5) and the severity (/3) of each behavior were determined and a score was calculated by multiplying the frequency and the severity of each behavior observed during the last month.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Family caregiver's burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 6; 1 month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline and Comparison between AD-TAR group and AD-Cognitive Stimulation group, Evaluation criteria: The burden of the family caregiver was measured with the Zarit scale (completed by the caregiver). Composed of 22 questions on the physical, emotional and financial load felt. Total score /88.</description>

    <measure>Global cognitive performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 6; 1 month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline and Comparison between AD-TAR group and AD-Cognitive Stimulation group, Evaluation criteria: MMSE (MINI MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION). 30-question general cognitive function assessment. The maximum score is 30.</description>
