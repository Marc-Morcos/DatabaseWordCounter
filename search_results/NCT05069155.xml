  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test the feasibility of using behavioral economic&#xD;
      interventions (gamification with social incentives) targeting daily step counts to prevent or&#xD;
      delay the development of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased physical activity by walking further or more vigorously may prevent or delay the&#xD;
      development of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) but reaching higher levels of&#xD;
      activity and maintaining it as a long-term habit is difficult to do. This project will use&#xD;
      concepts from behavioral science to create a game older adults can play in order to increase&#xD;
      their levels of activity while having fun doing it. The game is played with a support partner&#xD;
      who is a spouse, family member, or close friend who provides feedback and encouragement to&#xD;
      help the game-player reach activity goals and maintain them as habits over time. Participants&#xD;
      in the game will use their own smartphone and a wristwatch that tracks activity (such as a&#xD;
      FitBit, provided by this study) to set goals, get feedback, and play the game for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to continue wearing the wristwatch for another 6 weeks to track&#xD;
      activity after the game is over. To determine the effectiveness of this game, investigators&#xD;
      will randomly assign 50 people to the game and 50 people to only get the wristwatch but no&#xD;
      game component. All participants in this study will be recruited from an online registry of&#xD;
      adults age 55-75 who have not been diagnosed with Alzheimer's (GeneMatch) which offers&#xD;
      genetic testing on risk for ADRD to all participants. Investigators will recruit participants&#xD;
      who have elevated genetic risk as well as those without specific genetic risks for the study&#xD;
      to see if either group responds differently to the game.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 2-arm, randomized, controlled trial over 12 weeks with 6 weeks of follow-up (18 weeks total) that compares a control group that uses a wearable device to track physical activity to an intervention group that uses the same wearable devices and receives a supportive social incentive-based gamification intervention to adhere to a step goal program.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Intervention participants will receive a wearable device (e.g. FitBit) and will enter a game designed with behavioral economics concepts to address predictable barriers to behavior change during a 12-week intervention period.&#xD;
At the end of the 12 week intervention period, participants will enter a 6 week follow-up period during which interventions will cease but passive data collection of step counts will continue. Participants will also complete milestones within the study, such as the cognition and function assessment during weeks 1- 2, and 15-16. Participants will complete an end-of-study questionnaire on their experience with the wearable device and intervention design.</description>

    <description>Each participant signs a pre-commitment contract agreeing to try their best to achieve their daily step goal. Each week over the 12 week intervention period, participants are endowed 70 points (10/day). Participants are informed they will lose 10 points for each day the step goal is not met. Points are replenished at the start of the week. At the end of the week, if the participant has 40 points or more, he/she will advance one level, or drop one level if they have less than 40 points. The levels include: blue (lowest), bronze, silver, gold, platinum (highest). Each participant begins in the middle (silver). Each participant will also select a spouse, family member, or friend that they see often to serve as a supportive sponsor that receives a weekly email participants progress including points, game level, and average step countThis supportive sponsor will help to enhance social incentives to motivate the individual towards his or her goal.</description>
