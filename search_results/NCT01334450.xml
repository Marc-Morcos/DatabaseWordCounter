      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for treatment of Alzheimer disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and cognitive deteriorating in the&#xD;
      advanced age. The current medical treatment of AD is mainly symptomatic and has many&#xD;
      limitation. This main target of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using novel coil design (H2) for stimulation of deep&#xD;
      brain structures concomitantly with regular treatment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.&#xD;
      TMS acts by generating magnetic fields in the brain which simulate neuro-chemical changes and&#xD;
      stimulate neuronal activity translating into increased secretion of growth factors such as&#xD;
      brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Hence it is postulated that TMS will have a&#xD;
      positive effect on the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of patients with AD and may&#xD;
      ameliorated the progression of the disease. The treatment is non-invasive, with no&#xD;
      significant side effects, and no need of hospitalization or anesthesia. The trial is phase&#xD;
      IIb double blind study including 45 AD patients ages between 50 to 80 with mild or moderate&#xD;
      AD (Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] between 16 to 26) divided into 3 groups. All&#xD;
      participants will receive standard medical therapy for AD. In addition, patients recruited&#xD;
      for the study will receive 16 sessions of TMS with the H2 coil over 8 weeks. The first group&#xD;
      will receive excitatory stimulation of 10 Hz over the prefrontal and parietal cortex, the&#xD;
      second group will receive inhibitory stimulation of 1 Hz over similar brain areas and control&#xD;
      patients will receive the same amount of Sham sessions. Patient will receive 3 treatments per&#xD;
      week in the first 3 weeks and than 1 treatment per week for additional 4 weeks. Patients will&#xD;
      be evaluated before the treatments, after 8 weeks of treatment and after another 8 weeks&#xD;
      without treatment. The evaluations will include cognitive function according to ADAS-COG and&#xD;
      MMSE, Activity of daily living (ADL) functions according to ADSC-ADL, behavioral function&#xD;
      according to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), depression according to the Cornell Scale&#xD;
      for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), care giver satisfaction according to the RUD LITE scale&#xD;
      and computerized cognitive evaluation according to the NEXING battery. We expect that the&#xD;
      cognitive, behavioral and ADL functions will improve better in the study group as compared to&#xD;
      the Sham treated group. From previous trial of TMS in neurological patients, although not in&#xD;
      AD, we anticipate that adverse events rate will be similar between groups proving the safety&#xD;
      of deep TMS treatment in patients with AD. In case our hypothesis will be proven, deep TMS&#xD;
      treatment will be added as an important modality to the conventional therapy of AD patients.&#xD;
