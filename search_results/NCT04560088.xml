  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to provide initial evidence of the role of mindfulness&#xD;
      training in improving social disconnectedness - including social isolation and feelings of&#xD;
      loneliness - in older caregivers for family members with ADRD. The investigators propose a&#xD;
      two-arm randomized control trial: participants will be randomized to (a) smartphone-based&#xD;
      MBSR app (Headspace) or (b) active control (breathing app) for 14 days. Loneliness and&#xD;
      quality of social interactions will be assessed using Ecological Momentary Assessment at&#xD;
      baseline and 14-days after randomization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social isolation and feelings of loneliness are risk factors for older caregivers for family&#xD;
      members with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Further, social isolation and&#xD;
      loneliness place older caregivers at risk of poor health, including increased inflammation,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, depression, and premature mortality. Interventions to promote social&#xD;
      connectedness in older caregivers have the potential to reduce elevated morbidity and&#xD;
      premature mortality and buffer the high caregiving burden in this growing but understudied&#xD;
      population. Thus, developing effective treatments to reduce social disconnectedness in older&#xD;
      adults is essential, but previous behavioral treatment efforts have had limited success.&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based interventions may reduce loneliness in older adults, as demonstrated in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program. Another&#xD;
      recent study demonstrated the efficacy of a smartphone-based mindfulness training for&#xD;
      reducing loneliness and increasing social contact in daily life among adults reporting above&#xD;
      average stress; however, smartphone-based mindfulness training interventions have not been&#xD;
      tested with older adults, nor have they been tested with caregivers of family members with&#xD;
      ADRD. Specifically, prior studies were conducted with healthy adults not necessarily burdened&#xD;
      by caregiving; it remains unknown how caregiver stress --related to competing demands on time&#xD;
      and significant loneliness --may impact the ability to comply with the intervention as well&#xD;
      as indicate barriers to efficacy. The current study will follow a similar protocol as the&#xD;
      aforementioned randomized controlled trial that used a smartphone-based mindfulness training&#xD;
      to address loneliness and social contact.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 days</time_frame>
    <description>The FFMQ assesses five factors that represent mindfulness as it is currently conceptualized: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience. The 39 items of the FFMQ are rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). In addition to considering scores on the five subscales individually, facet scores can be combined to produce an overall mindfulness score. Higher scores indicate greater mindfulness.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 days</time_frame>
    <description>The DERS is a 36-item self-report measure that assesses emotion dysregulation in six domains: nonacceptance of emotional responses, difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior, impulse control difficulties, lack of emotional awareness, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and lack of emotional clarity. The DERS has demonstrated high internal consistency in clinical and nonclinical samples, good test-retest reliability over 8-weeks, construct validity, and sensitivity to change over time following interventions, including acceptance and mindfulness therapies. Items are rated on a scale of 1 (&quot;almost never [0-10%]&quot;) to 5 (&quot;almost always [91-100%]&quot;). Higher scores indicate more difficulty in emotion regulation.</description>

    <measure>The UCLA 3-Item Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>20 days</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment has demonstrated excellent internal consistency, test re-test reliability, and construct validity (associations with social support, social network size). Each question is rated on a 3-point scale: 1 = Hardly Ever; 2 = Some of the Time; 3 = Often. All items are summed to give a total score. Higher scores indicate more loneliness.</description>
