  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the 1.4 million nursing home (NH) residents in long term care facilities, more than half&#xD;
      have Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Due to changes in their familiar daily routines,&#xD;
      difficulty expressing their thoughts or asking for what they need, and overstimulation (such&#xD;
      as noise) or under stimulation (such as lack of activity), individuals with dementia often&#xD;
      display disruptive behaviors like resisting help or continually repeating the same phrases.&#xD;
      Medications are often prescribed to reduce agitation and aggressive behavior; however, these&#xD;
      medications may not be effective and can have a negative impact on the individual. Therefore,&#xD;
      families and other stakeholders strongly advocate the use of other types of approaches that&#xD;
      focus on minimizing the cause of the behavior. Two facility-based methodologies include the&#xD;
      transdisciplinary approach for integrated dementia care, which combines the expertise of all&#xD;
      NH staff, who work together to build a common language and approach for each resident, and&#xD;
      the multidisciplinary approach for problem-based dementia care, in which each staff member&#xD;
      conducts individual assessments and makes discipline-specific recommendations. While prior&#xD;
      research suggests that both of these facility-based approaches are useful, the circumstances&#xD;
      under which each approach is most effective are not clear. This project will prospectively&#xD;
      randomize 80 nursing homes to one of the two treatment arms to compare the effect of the&#xD;
      transdisciplinary approach versus the multidisciplinary approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the difference between the two comparators with respect to facility&#xD;
      rates of medications dispensed to residents with dementia, leading to enhanced quality of&#xD;
      life for the resident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is important because it will address a key clinical dilemma NH staff face as&#xD;
      they strive to optimize the use of alternative approaches to reduce disruptive behaviors in&#xD;
      residents with dementia. Transforming the quality of dementia care in NHs and enhancing the&#xD;
      quality of life of residents with dementia are high priorities for families and other&#xD;
      advocates.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  meet Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' minimum requirements for NHs (e.g.,&#xD;
             meeting the mandated number of hours of staff training on dementia care, performing&#xD;
             regularly scheduled resident assessments).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Facilities will be excluded if they have&#xD;
