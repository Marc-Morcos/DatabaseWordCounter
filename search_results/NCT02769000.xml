      Evaluate safety and toxicity/adverse events associated with delivery of low dose whole brain&#xD;
      irradiation in patients with early Alzheimer's dementia according to the National Institute&#xD;
      of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and&#xD;
      Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria.. As a secondary goal it will establish&#xD;
      whether or not the intervention with low dose whole brain irradiation stabilizes or decreases&#xD;
      cerebral amyloid deposits and whether these correlate with the recognized progression of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's dementia. The investigators will also collect information from the FDG and&#xD;
      Amyvid® PET Scans to determine if there is any correlation between neurocognitive/quality of&#xD;
      life scores and changes in amyloid plaque size, number and location.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently the 7th leading cause of death in the United States&#xD;
      with approximately 5.9 million Americans living with the progressive and debilitating&#xD;
      condition. AD predominantly affects older individuals as 86% of AD cases are in individuals&#xD;
      65 years of age and older. Further, approximately $172 billion of health care spending&#xD;
      annually can be attributed to costs associated with AD care on top of the 11 million&#xD;
      caregivers that provide care in unpaid capacities, such as family members, friends, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1975, a cohort of nearly 2,800 people who were 65 years of age and free of dementia&#xD;
      provided a basis for an incident study of dementia, as well as for Alzheimer's disease. This&#xD;
      cohort was followed for almost 29 years and its sentinel findings included a significantly&#xD;
      higher lifetime risk for both Alzheimer's and dementia in women compared to men. The&#xD;
      estimated lifetime risk was nearly one in five for women compared to one in ten for men. In&#xD;
      addition to the higher lifetime risk in women, expectancy of longer life and the aging of the&#xD;
      &quot;baby boomers&quot; combined with improved healthcare is expected to increase the number of&#xD;
      Americans who will reach 85 years of age or more. It is very clear that as the age increases,&#xD;
      so does the incidence of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 2010 and 2050, it is expected that there will be a 30% increase in the number of&#xD;
      individuals greater that 85 years of age. Although the absolute number may not appear to be&#xD;
      significant, this increase of approximately 17 million people will challenge the healthcare&#xD;
      system because of the cost associated with dealing various acute and chronic medical&#xD;
      conditions including AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While other major causes of death continue to experience decline, those from AD continues to&#xD;
      rise. In 1991, only approximately 14,000 death certificates recorded Alzheimer's disease as&#xD;
      an underlying cause. In 2006, it was noted that there was an increase of approximately 46% in&#xD;
      which Alzheimer's disease was listed as the direct cause of death. This is significant when&#xD;
      compared to the present leading cause of death, heart disease, which decreased by 11% in the&#xD;
      same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a neurophysiological standpoint, what is known about Alzheimer's disease is that there&#xD;
      appears to be a progressive process that is associated with the deposition of β Amyloid. This&#xD;
      appears to have a triggering mechanism, which causes the phosphorylation of a TAU protein,&#xD;
      which then leads to development neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), which are believed to be&#xD;
      responsible for memory loss, especially short-term and other associated problems with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's related dementia. It also appears that there may be a selective deposition of the&#xD;
      β Amyloid in the hippocampus and the prefrontal regions, which are the major short-term&#xD;
      memory regions of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive research has been ongoing to try to find various ways in which the excess&#xD;
      deposition of β Amyloid, the removal of excess β Amyloid, the initiation sequence that it is&#xD;
      involved in with phosphorylated TAU and other selective processes can be altered in an effort&#xD;
      to mitigate the devastating end term results. To date, there have been several trials,&#xD;
      including a vaccine trial performed in Europe and in the United States, which seem to show&#xD;
      that clearance of the β Amyloid is possible. However, there was not significant improvement&#xD;
      in neurocognitive function (NCF), which led to the discontinuation of these trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This lack of improvement in NCF was believed to be secondary to the fact that the β Amyloid&#xD;
      had already resulted in the phosphorylation of the TAU protein and development of NFT. Thus&#xD;
      removal of the initiator was accomplished, but only after the end damage had developed. Then&#xD;
      why consider irradiation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of radiation in the treatment of non-oncologic human populations has enjoyed a long&#xD;
      history and a more recent renaissance. It is now commonly used to prevent heterotopic bone&#xD;
      formation and re-development of keloids or heterotrophic scars post-operatively. It has been&#xD;
      shown in a randomized trial to effectively treat planter fasciitis and has been used in&#xD;
      post-operative treatment of resected pterygium. It has been used in the treatment of&#xD;
      Hidradenitis suppurativa, Duputryen's disease and Ledderhose's disease. These sites routinely&#xD;
      are treated with low dose fractionated external beam irradiation, commonly in doses that&#xD;
      ranging from 7 to 24 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of external irradiation has also been reported in the treatment of symptomatic&#xD;
      systemic amyloidosis. In published peer reviewed articles treatment sites have include&#xD;
      trachea-pulmonary, ocular, laryngeal and for use as a conditioning agent for autologous BMT&#xD;
      in patients with systemic amyloidosis. These reports used external beam irradiation that&#xD;
      ranged from 5.5 - 45 Gy and detail durable local control with these doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of this effect, a series of basic science experiments were initiated with genetically&#xD;
      altered mice: the B6; Cg - Tg 85 Dbo/J over express amyloid and the B6; 129-Psen1tm1MpmTg&#xD;
      over express both amyloid and TAU, making them prone to early Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both single and fractionated CNS irradiation in a genetically altered mouse model were&#xD;
      tested, and have shown similar results with reduction in amyloid plaque number, size and&#xD;
      volume. Moreover, the fractionated studies the investigators have demonstrated statistically&#xD;
      significant improvement in the treated mice using the Morris Water Maze Test when compared to&#xD;
      control non-treated animals, an effect which held up whether the animals were adolescent,&#xD;
      mature or aged (up to 18 months old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact mechanism by which radiation therapy confers benefit in the Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      mouse model will be difficult to elucidate as the exact pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      is not known. Possible mechanisms include the following: reduction of β amyloid by reducing&#xD;
      production or increasing clearance; reduction in Tau; induction of beneficial inflammatory&#xD;
      mechanisms; induction or inhibition of heat shock proteins; altering cerebral&#xD;
      microvasculature; and/or reversal of maladaptive neuroplasticity in the hippocampus.&#xD;
      Investigations of these possible mechanisms are currently underway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the complications related to studying Alzheimer's disease is the actual diagnosis.&#xD;
      Unlike malignancies where a biopsy can be obtained, Alzheimer's disease is a diagnosis of&#xD;
      exclusion or made at autopsy. While the Europeans have recently identified and agreed on CSF&#xD;
      biomarkers for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, the investigators have not accepted that&#xD;
      premise in the United States. At the present time, PET imaging which utilizes various&#xD;
      compounds has been utilized to identify depositions of amyloid in the CNS. More recently,&#xD;
      there is some suggestive evidence that a specific type of cataract may be seen in a high&#xD;
      percentage of patients with Alzheimer's disease related to possible β Amyloid deposition in&#xD;
      the lens region (29-30). Many rely on the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it is a diagnosis of exclusion, there are well-accepted neurocognitive tests (NCT) used&#xD;
      to monitor Alzheimer's disease progression. The Mini Mental exam is one of the general NCT&#xD;
      used to help establish the diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia. There are other more sensitive&#xD;
      neurocognitive tests available to track progression of Alzheimer's dementia, which the&#xD;
      investigators will use in this study. Note estimation of premorbid IQ is only completed at&#xD;
      the screening appointment and administration of the BNT and JLO only occur at the baseline&#xD;
      pre-treatment visit and the 12-months post-treatment follow up visit to minimize participant&#xD;
      fatigue and familiarity with the test materials. Administration of the NCT at the screening&#xD;
      visit will serve two purposes. Data obtained from the screening visit will ensure that&#xD;
      subjects who are enrolled in the trial meet criteria for early AD based on the more&#xD;
      comprehensive battery of tests, as diagnosis of dementia is improved with use of quantitative&#xD;
      measurement of multiple domains. The NCT at this screening visit will also expose&#xD;
      participants to the NCT and since practice effects are greatest between the first and second&#xD;
      exposure to NCT, practice effects will be minimized using this exposure and repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological functioning and quality of life (QOL) will also be evaluated to monitor&#xD;
      participants' emotional status throughout the trial. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and&#xD;
      the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaires will be used to assess depression and&#xD;
      anxiety, respectively. If any participant endorses suicidal ideation on the PHQ-9, the&#xD;
      Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) will be administered to fully evaluate the&#xD;
      participant's suicidal ideation and study stopping rules will be implemented as needed to&#xD;
      ensure the individual's safety. QOL will be evaluated by the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (QOL-AD) and Quality of Life in Late-stage Dementia (QUALID) and Everyday Cognition&#xD;
      (ECog) questionnaires (patient and caregiver forms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concern may be raised regarding the use of whole brain irradiation and its potential&#xD;
      deleterious effect on neurocognitive testing. There have been reports on post-radiation&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing in the setting of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), which is&#xD;
      whole brain fractionated RT commonly employed for patients with pulmonary small cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. The standard whole brain PCI dose is 2.5 Gy x 10, considerably higher than the 2.0&#xD;
      Gy x 5 or 2.0 Gy x 10 schemes planned in the present study. Furthermore, patients in the PCI&#xD;
      studies also received chemotherapy in addition to whole brain irradiation, and chemotherapy&#xD;
      itself effects long-term NCF. In these PCI reports, if any neurocognitive decline was&#xD;
      identified, it was modest, occurred within a short interval, e.g. 6-9 months, and improved.&#xD;
      The investigators are thus proposing a 9-month follow up period for the 1st subject cohort&#xD;
      (2.0 Gy x 5) before proceeding with the 2nd cohort (2.0 Gy x 10), although both cohorts will&#xD;
      undergo NCF and QOL testing through 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grosshans and colleagues from M. D. Anderson found that PCI is &quot;unlikely to significantly&#xD;
      affect NCF.&quot; They evaluated cognitive function in small cell lung cancer patients who&#xD;
      received PCI (mean 2.5 Gy x 10). After chemotherapy, but before PCI, 47% already had evidence&#xD;
      of impaired cognitive function. On multivariate analysis, there were no significant further&#xD;
      declines after PCI. On univariate analysis, there were unsustained, early decreases in&#xD;
      executive and language function, which did not persist with follow-up. A Japanese group&#xD;
      applied the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (revised Japanese version, HVLT-R) in 40 whole brain&#xD;
      RT patients, at baseline, 4 months, and 8 months. Whole brain fractionation was either 2.5 Gy&#xD;
      x 4, 3.0 Gy x 10, or 2.5 Gy x 10. The respective probabilities of decline in HVLT-R total&#xD;
      recall at 4 months were, respectively, 40%, 7%, and 0%, and at 8 months 13%, 14% and 0% (48).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also applicable is a recent report of whole brain (and whole spine) RT for medulloblastoma in&#xD;
      children, a population believed more vulnerable to cognitive decline from RT. They did not&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy, rather RT alone, 36 Gy in 36 fractions (1.0 Gy BID) to the entire brain&#xD;
      and spine, followed by a boost to 68 Gy in 68 fractions to the tumor bed, typically posterior&#xD;
      fossa. Using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children to give verbal quotient,&#xD;
      performance quotient, and full-scale intelligence quotient, cognitive function was preserved&#xD;
      for all test domains throughout the study at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years, with no decline&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low dose whole brain RT has demonstrated safety in many studies, and the investigators will&#xD;
      be using even lower doses. These lower radiation therapy doses have a history of excellent&#xD;
      success for patients with non-cerebral amyloidosis, and have had durable response combined&#xD;
      with the necropsy / neurocognitive testing in genetically altered Alzheimer's disease mouse&#xD;
      model, the investigators decided to proceed with a human trial, using fractionated whole&#xD;
      brain radiation doses of 2.0 Gy x 5, then 2.0 Gy x 10. Subjects will be followed with&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing at 6 weeks, 3, 9 and 12 months post RT. Additionally, given that the&#xD;
      development of supranuclear cataract has been reported in a high percent of AD patients, the&#xD;
      investigators will recommend ocular testing at baseline and at 1 year to assess a potential&#xD;
      abscopal effect, collateral benefit to the non-targeted lenses from treatment of the primary&#xD;
      disease in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to the development of cataracts in association with AD, early and accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still a challenge and the confirmatory diagnosis is&#xD;
      made by presence of features including beta-amyloid plaques postmortem. In 2014, Tian et al&#xD;
      suggested that AD may have a common pathophysiology with supranuclear deposits of&#xD;
      beta-amyloid in the human lens. The brain and the lens tissue both arise from the ectoderm&#xD;
      tissue (neuroectoderm and surface ectoderm respectively). Their conclusions were based on a&#xD;
      meta-analysis of studies, which provided mixed data regarding the correlation of beta-amyloid&#xD;
      in the lens samples of patients with AD, Down syndrome and controls. Given the chronicity of&#xD;
      the terminally differentiated cell types in the lens that may be affected by Alzheimer&#xD;
      disease's pathology, they concluded that there is a possibility than an ocular biomarker for&#xD;
      early AD may exist in the lens. This would suggest that an early ophthalmic examination may&#xD;
      provide a window of hope into early diagnosis of AD. It may also provide an opportunity for&#xD;
      early treatment and perhaps monitoring of improvement in supranuclear cataracts with systemic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A precedent for this is already found in Wilson's disease. Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) ring seen&#xD;
      in Wilson's disease (WD) is due to copper deposition in the Descemet's membrane in the&#xD;
      sclero-corneal junction in the eye. Although believed to be pathognomic of WD, it may be seen&#xD;
      in many other hepatic conditions and intraocular copper-containing foreign bodies. The K-F&#xD;
      ring detected in pre-symptomatic cases of WD may lead to speedy diagnosis and early&#xD;
      management. Co-relation of K-F ring in WD to the disease severity, disappearance with&#xD;
      successful treatment, reappearance with non-compliant treatment aids in management of WD. K-F&#xD;
      ring detection in first-degree relatives of the index case is also important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the proposed ocular exams at baseline and at 9-months post treatment, the investigators&#xD;
      hope to detect any cataracts in the subjects and effects of the proposed radiation&#xD;
      treatments. The questions the investigators will have are how often they encounter them in&#xD;
      early Alzheimer's and whether they improve (an abscopal effect) after radiation therapy, even&#xD;
      though the lenses will be excluded from the RT treatment fields. Exams will only be done for&#xD;
      subjects who have at least one natural lense still present. Subjects with previous cataract&#xD;
      corrections will not have ocular exams performed.&#xD;
