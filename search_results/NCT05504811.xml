  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy of a newly developed exercise device (FitMi AD) for&#xD;
      individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
      FitMi AD uses embedded sensors that can track and record the patient's direction and degree&#xD;
      of movement while performing exercises described on a computer.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Analog Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post-Treatment (an average of 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Indicates perceived pain intensity. The scale consists of a line, often 10 cm long, with verbal anchors at either end (i.e. &quot;no pain&quot; on the far left and &quot;the most intense pain imaginable&quot; on the far right). The patient places a mark at a point on the line corresponding to the patient's rating of pain intensity.</description>

    <description>Evaluates depression in elderly individuals. Scores of 0-4 are considered normal, depending on age, education, and complaints; 5-8 indicate mild depression; 9-11 indicate moderate depression; and 12-15 indicate severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post-Treatment (an average of 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality.</description>
