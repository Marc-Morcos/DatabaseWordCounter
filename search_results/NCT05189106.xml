      This is an open-label, biomarker-driven basket trial of baricitinib in people with subjective&#xD;
      cognitive disorder, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Amyotrophic lateral&#xD;
      sclerosis (ALS), or asymptomatic carriers of an ALS-related gene, such as a hexanucleotide&#xD;
      expansion in the C9ORF72 gene, with evidence of abnormal inflammatory signaling in&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at baseline. Each participant will be treated with baricitinib for&#xD;
      24 weeks; no placebo will be given. Participants will receive baricitinib 2 mg per day by&#xD;
      mouth for the first 8 weeks and baricitinib 4 mg per day by mouth for the remaining 16 weeks.&#xD;
      This proof of concept trial will ascertain whether baricitinib at 2 mg per day, 4 mg per day,&#xD;
      or both reaches therapeutic levels in the CSF and suppresses inflammatory biomarkers&#xD;
      associated with type I interferon signaling among the study participants.&#xD;

      Overview of Clinical Trial: Many age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, including&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are associated with&#xD;
      increased inflammatory signaling in the central nervous system. While there is growing&#xD;
      evidence that activation of inflammatory signaling leads to neuronal death in cell-based&#xD;
      models and leads to signs and symptoms of neurodegeneration in animal models, no disease&#xD;
      modifying anti-inflammatory drugs for AD or ALS have been found to date. Recent observational&#xD;
      studies of anti-inflammatory drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis suggest the potential&#xD;
      of these drugs to prevent a diagnosis of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, biomarker-driven basket trial of baricitinib in individuals with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI), subjective cognitive decline (SCD), AD, ALS, or asymptomatic&#xD;
      carriers of an ALS causative gene, such as a hexanucleotide expansion in the C9ORF72 gene.&#xD;
      Baricitinib at 2 mg per day is approved by the FDA in the United States (US) for rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis. Baricitinib at 4 mg per day is approved has emergency use authorization by the FDA&#xD;
      for COVID-19 in the US. Each participant will be treated with open-label baricitinib for 24&#xD;
      weeks. No patient will receive a placebo. Participants will receive baricitinib 2 mg per day&#xD;
      by mouth for the first 8 weeks and baricitinib 4 mg per day by mouth for the remaining 16&#xD;
      weeks. Participants will have a lumbar puncture (LP) at screening and cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF) will be examined for study eligibility. Participants will be enrolled if their CSF&#xD;
      level inflammatory biomarker meets threshold requirements and if they meet all other&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. All enrolled participants must have received a first dose of&#xD;
      recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; also known as Shingrix) within 4 years prior to treatment&#xD;
      initiation. Over the course of 32-week trial, there will be a total of 8 visits. Blood will&#xD;
      be collected at 7 visits, urine and CSF will be collected at 4 visits. Clinical outcomes will&#xD;
      be measured at 2 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Converging evidence reveals inflammatory signaling is robustly active within the&#xD;
      central nervous system of subsets of patients with AD and ALS, both in autopsied brains and&#xD;
      profiles of CSF of living patients. Moreover, investigators find biomarkers of inflammatory&#xD;
      signaling in the CSF of a subset of patients with AD and ALS. Baricitinib, an FDA-approved&#xD;
      drug for rheumatoid arthritis, rescued inflammatory biomarkers and neural cell death in a&#xD;
      human neural cell culture model of inflammatory-mediated death in a dose-dependent manner.&#xD;
      Independently, in computational biology studies of gene expression profiles of AD brains&#xD;
      termed DRIAD (drug repurposing in AD), baricitinib was among the leading drugs that reversed&#xD;
      the actions of AD. Investigators have characterized a signature of inflammatory signaling in&#xD;
      the brains and CSF of AD and ALS patients that is specific for this inflammatory mechanism of&#xD;
      neuronal death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work has laid the foundation for the design of a mechanistic, biomarker-driven trial. In&#xD;
      this trial, investigators will evaluate the FDA-approved JAK inhibitor baricitinib using an&#xD;
      escalating dose design. Baricitinib is an oral medication FDA-approved for rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis at a 2-mg daily dosage and FDA emergency use authorized for COVID-19 at a 4 mg&#xD;
      daily dosage. The trial will determine whether baricitinib at 2 mg per day 4 mg per day, or&#xD;
      both enters the cerebrospinal fluid and attains therapeutic levels, as well as whether it&#xD;
      reduces inflammatory biomarkers in the CSF of patients at risk for or with AD and at risk for&#xD;
      or with ALS. If this Phase I/II trial demonstrates that baricitinib is safe in AD and ALS&#xD;
      patients and achieves therapeutic levels in the CSF as determined by drug concentration and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic biomarkers, then a Phase III clinical trial powered to assess clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in AD patients, ALS patients, or both would be warranted.&#xD;
