      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of galantamine in&#xD;
      patients with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a chronic, progressive brain disease that may involve a number of symptoms,&#xD;
      including memory loss and changes in personality, behavior, judgment, attention span,&#xD;
      language and thought. The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Over time,&#xD;
      patients with Alzheimer's disease may lose ability to perform daily tasks related to personal&#xD;
      care (for example bathing, dressing, eating) and may be unable to handle money or travel to&#xD;
      familiar places. Previous short-term studies have shown galantamine to be safe and effective&#xD;
      in treating patients with Alzheimer's disease, however the long-term safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of galantamine have not been examined. This multicenter, randomized study will assess whether&#xD;
      long-term treatment with galantamine will delay the onset of symptoms associated with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and examine the safety and effectiveness of long-term treatment with&#xD;
      galantamine. Patients will receive 12 months of open-label treatment with galantamine,&#xD;
      followed by 24 months of double-blind treatment with galantamine or placebo. Safety&#xD;
      evaluations (incidence of adverse events, physical examinations, 12 lead ECGs, vital signs,&#xD;
      laboratory tests) will be performed throughout the study. Effectiveness will be determined&#xD;
      using standard tests and rating scales to assess mental status, functioning, thinking,&#xD;
      behavior, judgment and language (Mini Mental Status Exam [MMSE], Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      Assessment Scale [ADAS-cog]; Disability Assessment for Dementia [DAD], and Clinician's&#xD;
      Interview Based Impression of Changes plus Family Input [CIBIC-plus]). After the first 4&#xD;
      weeks, assessments will be performed every 3 months during the open-label phase (first 12&#xD;
      months) and then every 6 months during the double-blind phase (13-36 months). Patients whose&#xD;
      symptoms worsen as defined by an increase of &gt; or = to 4 points in their ADAS-cog score from&#xD;
      the start of the double-blind phase will be withdrawn from the study. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that long-term treatment with galantamine will be effective in delaying the cognitive&#xD;
      deterioration in patients with Alzheimer's disease and that galantamine is well-tolerated&#xD;
      with long term treatment. Galantamine 4 milligrams twice daily by mouth for 4 weeks, then 8&#xD;
      milligrams twice daily for 48 weeks. Thereafter, galantamine will be given as 8 milligrams&#xD;
      twice daily for an additional 24 months.&#xD;
