    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to investigate the effects of repetitive Transcranial&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) treatment on patients with probable early or moderate Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon meeting the inclusion criteria and providing informed consent, each participant will&#xD;
      complete a series of cognitive assessments and rTMS treatments at the TMS Lab at Riverview&#xD;
      Health Center (PE-450).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, patients at each site will be assigned using stratified block randomization&#xD;
      into either active or sham treatment arms with different duration of treatment (either 2&#xD;
      weeks or 4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS at frequency of 20 Hz will be used to stimulate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (DLPFC) of each patient in the real groups. Prior to the first treatment, and once per week&#xD;
      during treatment, the patient's motor threshold will be measured using single pulses of TMS,&#xD;
      noting the intensity necessary to cause a small twitch in the thumb finger. Then, the 70 mm&#xD;
      cooled coil will be placed on the head at a location for optimal stimulation of the DLPFC at&#xD;
      an intensity of 90-100% of the motor threshold. The 20 Hz rTMS treatment will incorporate 30&#xD;
      pulses per train, with 25 trains per side of the brain per session (total of 750 pulses per&#xD;
      side per session). The trains will have a duration of 1.5 seconds, with an intertrain&#xD;
      interval of 10 seconds. Each TMS treatment session will take approximately 10 to 25 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DLPFC will be located on each patient using our Brainsight neuronavigation system from a&#xD;
      reference MRI scan. If we cannot retrieve a valid previous clinical MRI scan or a valid&#xD;
      ordered research MRI scan, a reference head model will approximate the patient's anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments will be administered daily (5 days/week) either for 4 weeks or 2 weeks. The&#xD;
      same protocol will also be used while doing sham stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent un-blinding, the Magstim sham coil will be used; it provides the same sound and&#xD;
      tactile sensory experience as those of the real coil, but it attenuates the strength of the&#xD;
      induced electrical field in the brain well below the threshold required to stimulate neurons.&#xD;
      In addition, during the treatment, only the designated research assistant and the patient&#xD;
      will be present. It should also be noted that the only people who know the grouping are: the&#xD;
      rTMS administrator (who also groups the patients) at each site and the sites' coordinator.&#xD;
      The patients' grouping info will be in a secure folder in a locked cabinet to which only the&#xD;
      rTMS administrator and the three sites coordinator will have the key.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed six times during the study. This will occur at weeks 0, 3, 5,&#xD;
      13, 21, and 29 for the 4 week treatment groups, and weeks 0, 3, 5, 11, 19, and 27 for the 2&#xD;
      week treatment group. Each assessment will involve a set of nine assessment tools, including&#xD;
      ADAS-Cog as the primary outcome measure and various other tasks and questionnaires to measure&#xD;
      cognition, memory, caregiver burden, symptoms, and treatment tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Winnipeg and Montreal sites only: The immediate effects (i.e. within 3 minutes) after&#xD;
      participants receive the rTMS treatment will be assessed with a 1-minute semantic fluency&#xD;
      test at four time points. This will occur at before and immediately after rTMS intervention&#xD;
      in Week 1 and at weeks 5 and 13 for the 4 week treatment groups, and before and immediately&#xD;
      after rTMS intervention in Week 1 and at weeks 5 and 11 for the 2 week treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are randomized to the sham treatment will be unblinded at the 6 month follow up&#xD;
      and offered either 2-weeks or 4-weeks treatment; the patients and/or their family can choose&#xD;
      the duration of treatment. As such, the 12 month assessment will be an unblinded follow up&#xD;
      only of those initially randomised to one of the real groups (2-weeks or 4-weeks of&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;
