    <textblock>
      Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2) is a Phase III, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      masked, 6 month, multi-center randomized clinical trial sponsored by National Institutes of&#xD;
      Aging involving 200 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD). ADMET 2 is designed to&#xD;
      examine the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate as treatment for clinically significant&#xD;
      apathy in AD participants. ADMET 2 will enroll participants from real world settings such as&#xD;
      outpatient, nursing home, and assisted living facilities and will examine the effects of&#xD;
      methylphenidate on apathy and cognition. ADMET 2 will also conduct careful safety monitoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADMET 2 will examine in a masked, randomized trial the efficacy of methylphenidate for the&#xD;
      treatment of clinically significant apathy in participants with Alzheimer's dementia.&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed as the change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory Apathy subscale (NPI&#xD;
      apathy) from baseline to 6 months and score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study -&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMET 2 will also examine the safety of methylphenidate for the treatment of clinically&#xD;
      significant apathy in participants with Alzheimer's disease by measuring vital signs,&#xD;
      electrolyte panels, adverse event reports, and electrocardiograms. Safety will also be&#xD;
      measured by examining neuropsychiatric symptoms other than apathy using the Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Inventory (NPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes from baseline to 6 months in other neuropsychological assessments as measured using&#xD;
      the Dementia Apathy Interview and Rating (DAIR) scale will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness will be measured by assessing quality of life and economic assessment and&#xD;
      cognitive changes using a cognitive battery that includes the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE)&#xD;
      and other scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biomarker sub-study initiated part-way through the main trial will collect information on&#xD;
      blood-based biomarkers, including microRNA, markers of oxidative stress, inflammation,&#xD;
      neuronal loss and lipidomics.&#xD;
