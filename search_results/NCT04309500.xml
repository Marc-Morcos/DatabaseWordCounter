    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test efficacy and safety of person-centered, culturally-informed&#xD;
      protocols for disclosure of different combinations of Alzheimer's dementia risk factors.&#xD;
      Building on the results from a federally-funded assessment of preferences and needs of&#xD;
      racially diverse participants and their respective friends/family members, in regard to&#xD;
      Dementia - Alzheimer's Type, we have produced protocols for communication of DAT risk, with&#xD;
      attention to specific adaptations in style or content based on individual factors and&#xD;
      preferences. These protocols allow for communication of risk based on clinical history and&#xD;
      diagnosis, structural neuroimaging, apolipoprotein-E status, and amyloid and tau burden on&#xD;
      positron emission tomography. In particular, protocols specify (a) effective methods of&#xD;
      communicating risk conferred by each data source, (b) information designed for patients&#xD;
      versus informants, (c) psychoeducation needs, and (d) resource/support needs. We will recruit&#xD;
      a randomly-selected subset of 10 dyads (including 5 participants who are Non-Hispanic&#xD;
      African-American, 5 participants who are Non-Hispanic White) from the Stage I sample to whom&#xD;
      we will develop and implement personalized DAT risk disclosure protocols. We will provide&#xD;
      preliminary information on the effectiveness of these protocols in terms of&#xD;
      patient/co-participant comprehension and recall of feedback provided, and initial changes in&#xD;
      mood or behavior immediately following and shortly after risk disclosure sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, a divide exists between Dementia - Alzheimer's Type (DAT) risk information that is&#xD;
      shared in clinical settings versus genetic and biomarker-based risk information gathered and,&#xD;
      less frequently, disseminated in research settings. Clinical feedback continues to discuss&#xD;
      DAT risk in terms of personal/family history, neuropsychological or neurological testing, and&#xD;
      standard neuroimaging reports. Research advances in genotyping, quantitative neuroimaging,&#xD;
      and amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) have improved our risk prediction and&#xD;
      disease staging; however, the literature on how to share these important findings is sparse.&#xD;
      Effective risk disclosure protocols are fundamentally dependent on the needs of recipients.&#xD;
      However, we do not know how patients, or those tasked with current or future caregiving,&#xD;
      decide what sources or types of risk information they want disclosed, nor their reasons for&#xD;
      preferring certain types of information over others. Given the differences between static&#xD;
      (e.g., family history, genotyping) and dynamic, potentially modifiable risk factors (e.g.,&#xD;
      amyloid burden), as well as varying familiarity with research-based biomarkers, it is&#xD;
      especially important to understand how much information patients hope to receive and what&#xD;
      they hope to do with it. This knowledge gap is particularly pertinent in minority and&#xD;
      low-income populations given systemic challenges and cultural beliefs that may affect their&#xD;
      psychological, physical, and financial ability to adapt to a high risk profile. Thus,&#xD;
      understanding risk disclosure needs and preferences is a critical step in developing&#xD;
      culturally-informed feedback protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 (accomplished during the Stage I observational Needs Assessment - HUM00160276) was to&#xD;
      investigate the preferences and needs of racially diverse participants, and their respective&#xD;
      informants, in regards to receiving feedback about their risk for DAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 is to develop person-centered, culturally-informed protocols for disclosure of&#xD;
      different combinations of Alzheimer's dementia risk factors. Building on the results of Aim&#xD;
      1, we have produced protocols for communication of DAT risk, with attention to specific&#xD;
      adaptations in style or content based on individual factors and preferences. In particular,&#xD;
      protocols specify (a) effective methods of communicating risk conferred by each data source,&#xD;
      (b) information designed for patients versus informants, (c) psychoeducation needs, and (d)&#xD;
      resource/support needs. We will recruit a randomly-selected subset of 10 dyads (including 5&#xD;
      participants who are Non-Hispanic African-American, 5 participants who are Non-Hispanic&#xD;
      White) from the Stage I sample to whom we will develop and implement personalized DAT risk&#xD;
      disclosure protocols. We will provide preliminary information on the effectiveness of these&#xD;
      protocols in terms of patient/co-participant comprehension and recall of feedback provided,&#xD;
      and initial changes in mood or behavior immediately following and shortly after risk&#xD;
      disclosure sessions.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Stage II will involve a clinical trial, with the risk disclosure feedback serving as the behavioral intervention. The study will use a single-group design with no control group. All 10 participant-co-participant dyads (5 Non-Hispanic African-American, 5 Non-Hispanic White) will receive feedback about the participant's DAT risk. Outcomes will be measured immediately following feedback and at 1- and 6-weeks following risk disclosure.</intervention_model_description>
