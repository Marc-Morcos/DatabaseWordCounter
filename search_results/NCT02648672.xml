    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind (investigator and subject blinded), placebo controlled&#xD;
      ascending single dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile&#xD;
      of BPN14770 in healthy male and female subjects. Each subject will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either a single dose of BPN14770 or placebo.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of single oral ascending dose levels of&#xD;
           BPN14770 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the BPN14770 plasma pharmacokinetic profile following oral&#xD;

             (FSH) test at screening. In addition, all females must have a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
             result within 48 hours before study drug administration regardless of childbearing&#xD;
             potential.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Subject must understand the study procedures, voluntarily consent to participate in&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Inability or unwillingness to comply with the protocol or rules of the clinical&#xD;
             research unit, or likely inability to complete the study.&#xD;
