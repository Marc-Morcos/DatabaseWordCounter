  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EYE-TAR(MA)-Follow-Up is a non-interventionel, long-term follow-up study in subjects who&#xD;
      participated to the study referred as EYE-TAR(MA) (NCT04730440)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EYE-TAR(MA)-Follow-Up aims to evaluate the long-term impacts of the Training of Affect&#xD;
      Recognition TAR (an emotion recognition rehabilitation program), on social cognition&#xD;
      abilities, evolve gaze strategies, behavioral disorders, and the caregiver's burden in&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who completed EYE-TAR(MA) study, and who have signed informed consent for this&#xD;
      follow-up, will be eligible to enroll. They will attend one visit two years post EYE-TAR(MA)&#xD;
      study intervention (intervention was TAR, or a &quot;classic&quot; cognitive stimulation program) to&#xD;
      undergo the following evaluation: Eye-tracking recording during Ekman Faces task, Mini Mental&#xD;
      State Examination (MMSE), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Zarit scale (completed by&#xD;
      caregiver).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is commonly admitted that social cognition impairment, like deficit in facial emotion&#xD;
      recognition or misinterpretation of others' intentions (Theory of Mind), are associated with&#xD;
      social behavior disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This kind of disorders are observed in Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's Dementia&#xD;
      (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), with severe deficits in FTD and lighter deficits in AD and&#xD;
      PD. One explanation is that patients apply inappropriate visual exploration strategies to&#xD;
      decode emotions and intentions of others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study EYE-TAR(MA), NCT04730440, aimed to evaluate impacts of an emotion recognition&#xD;
      rehabilitation program, named Training of Affect Recognition (TAR), on social cognition&#xD;
      abilities (facial emotion recognition and theory of mind) in AD. In addition, investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that the effect of this rehabilitation will also evolve gaze strategies,&#xD;
      behavioral disorders, and the caregiver's burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EYE-TAR(MA) results showed that participants who participated to the TAR (a) recognized&#xD;
      facial emotions better and faster, especially sadness, fear and neutral expression; (b)&#xD;
      evolved their gaze strategies on emotional faces with increased observation of the upper part&#xD;
      of the face (nose and / or eyes); (c) had reduced behavioral disorders and the caregiver's&#xD;
      burden. These results were specific to the TAR, since no significant change was observed in&#xD;
      the AD-Control group who had participated in a &quot;classic&quot; cognitive stimulation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These changes were generally maintained one month after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because there is not long-term follow-up data for these patients, Sponsor and investigators&#xD;
      set-up the EYE-TAR(MA)-Follow-Up study to evaluate the long-term impacts of the Training of&#xD;
      Affect Recognition, on social cognition abilities, evolve gaze strategies, behavioral&#xD;
      disorders, and the caregiver's burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who completed EYE-TAR(MA) study, and who have signed informed consent for this&#xD;
      follow-up, will be eligible to enroll. They will attend a visit two years post EYE-TAR(MA)&#xD;
      study intervention to undergo the following evaluation: Eye-tracking recording during Ekman&#xD;
      Faces task, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Zarit&#xD;
      scale (completed by caregiver).&#xD;

    <description>Change from EYE-TAR(MA) Last evaluation and Comparison of FER performance between Long-term follow-up AD-TAR group and Long-term follow-up AD-Cognitive Stimulation group.&#xD;
Evaluation criteria: Scores to Ekman Faces task (1976) and time to answer. FER was assessed using pictures from the Ekman Faces task (1976), to test the recognition of the six facial basic emotions and neutral faces. There were four pictures per emotion, for a total of 28. For each picture, participants were asked to select one of the seven labels (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, surprise and neutral), with a maximum of 8 seconds of response time per picture.</description>

Evaluation criteria: Eye movements (number and duration of fixations on areas of interest) recorded with an eye-tracking device. FER was assessed using some pictures from the Ekman Faces task (1976).</description>

    <description>Change from EYE-TAR(MA) Last evaluation and Comparison between Long-term follow-up AD-TAR group and Long-term follow-up AD-Cognitive Stimulation group.&#xD;
Evaluation criteria: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), a scale that includes ten behavioral items (delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability and aberrant motor behaviors) and two neurovegetative symptoms (sleep and appetite disorders). The evaluation was based on an interview with patients' primary caregivers. Both the frequency (/5) and the severity (/3) of each behavior were determined and a score was calculated by multiplying the frequency and the severity of each behavior observed during the last month.</description>
