  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are very few effective interventions that promote functional independence in people&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. This R21 project is the first step in&#xD;
      the long-term goal of developing an effective, enjoyable, portable, and inexpensive&#xD;
      non-immersive virtual reality (VR) training intervention for improving the performance of&#xD;
      everyday tasks. The investigators' VR training approach is built upon the results of past&#xD;
      studies that show 1) when people with AD repeatedly practice daily tasks they subsequently&#xD;
      perform them more completely and without error; and 2) healthy people are able to transfer&#xD;
      skills learned in VR-contexts to tasks in the real world. This R21 study will obtain&#xD;
      preliminary data to inform a future randomized clinical trial through three aims: Aim 1) To&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that individuals with mild-moderate AD will show improved performance on&#xD;
      an everyday task after repeatedly practicing the task in a non-immersive VR setting; Aim 2)&#xD;
      To explore usability and acceptability of the VR training as well as associations between&#xD;
      individual differences variables (e.g., cognitive abilities, demographics) and training&#xD;
      effects. To test Aim 1, 40 participants with mild to moderate AD will be recruited to&#xD;
      complete daily VR Training sessions for one week. VR Training will include repeated practice&#xD;
      of a single, everyday task in a non-immersive VR-context (VR Breakfast or VR Lunch;&#xD;
      counterbalanced across participants). The primary outcome measure is performance of the&#xD;
      real-life version of the trained task, which will be collected before and at two time points&#xD;
      after training, compared to performance of an untrained, control task of comparable&#xD;
      difficulty, and scored from video by coders blinded to training task/condition. To evaluate&#xD;
      Aim 2, all participants and an informant will complete interviews and questionnaires and&#xD;
      participants will complete tests of cognitive abilities. Usability and acceptability of the&#xD;
      VR training will be evaluated and associations between participant variables and VR Training&#xD;
      results will be explored. If the proposed hypothesis is supported and results show that&#xD;
      training effects generalize from virtual to real tasks in the study sample, then VR training&#xD;
      of custom and individualized tasks will be investigated in a future randomized, controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial for maintaining and improving functional abilities in people with mild to&#xD;
      moderate AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional disability, the loss of independence in everyday tasks like meal preparation, is a&#xD;
      core diagnostic criterion for clinical dementia/Alzheimer's disease (AD) and contributes to&#xD;
      the disease's exorbitant costs and caregiver burden. There is currently no cure for AD and&#xD;
      available interventions have had limited success at reducing functional disability. Cognitive&#xD;
      training leads to reliable improvements on the specific task(s) that are repeatedly&#xD;
      practiced, but transfer to untrained, functional tasks is limited. Because of both limited&#xD;
      transfer and rigid (procedural) learning in AD, novel language-based interventions for&#xD;
      dementia have focused on repeated practice with a circumscribed and highly personalized&#xD;
      vocabulary to maintain functional communication. Repeated practice of everyday tasks&#xD;
      (leveraging intact procedural memory also has been shown to improve performance of trained&#xD;
      tasks in people with AD but is not a feasible intervention, because the effort required to&#xD;
      set up tasks, monitor performance, and provide feedback/supervision is far greater than&#xD;
      having a caregiver simply complete the task for the patient. However, if repeated practice of&#xD;
      specific everyday tasks could be implemented in a more cost-effective, efficient manner, then&#xD;
      this straightforward intervention strategy could reduce functional disability and associated&#xD;
      costs of care and caregiver burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This R21 proposal will investigate the efficacy of a low-cost and portable computer training&#xD;
      program that uses non-immersive virtual reality (VR) to enable participants with AD to&#xD;
      independently practice meaningful everyday activities (e.g., meal preparation). The goal of&#xD;
      this R21 study is to evaluate the extent to which training in a virtual context will&#xD;
      generalize to real life tasks. If training effects generalize from virtual to real settings,&#xD;
      then training of customized tasks for maintaining and improving functional abilities in older&#xD;
      adults with AD will be investigated in a future randomized, controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal was informed by a cognitive activation model on which everyday activities are&#xD;
      represented as schema hierarchies. Activation within the schema hierarchy may spread&#xD;
      automatically from higher level schema (e.g., make lunch) to lower level schema (e.g., spread&#xD;
      peanut butter) as well as from objects or environments that may &quot;trigger&quot; associated schema&#xD;
      (e.g., a coffee mug may activate coffee-making schema). Deliberate cognitive control is&#xD;
      essential to modulate activations, enable smooth transitions between schema subtasks, and&#xD;
      inhibit inappropriate activation from objects in the environment. Without control mechanisms,&#xD;
      interference from competing schema or objects in the environment may derail performance and&#xD;
      lead to inefficiency and disorganization of task steps (i.e., commission errors like&#xD;
      mis-sequencing, incorrect object selection, etc.). Another mechanism for performance&#xD;
      difficulties involves premature decay of schema activation or degraded task schema/knowledge&#xD;
      (i.e., omission errors). On this model, repeated practice serves to strengthen associations&#xD;
      within a schema hierarchy and between task schema and target objects in the environment,&#xD;
      reducing the burden on control mechanisms and the likelihood of premature decay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of VR Training the investigators will recruit 40 participants with&#xD;
      AD to complete daily training sessions for one week. VR Training will include repeated&#xD;
      practice of a single, everyday task in a non-immersive VR context (e.g., VR Breakfast) using&#xD;
      a laptop with a touch-screen interface. Performance of a real-life version of the trained&#xD;
      task (e.g., Real Breakfast) and a matched, untrained/control, real task (e.g., Real Lunch)&#xD;
      before and at two time points post-VR Training will serve as the primary outcome measures.&#xD;
      All procedures are designed to achieve the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that individuals with mild-moderate AD will show improved&#xD;
      performance on an everyday task after repeatedly practicing the task in VR. When people with&#xD;
      AD repeatedly practice tasks in real life, they show improved performance of those tasks.&#xD;
      Transfer from VR training to real life outcomes has not been systematically studied in AD,&#xD;
      but healthy adults, a case report of a woman with moderate AD, and pilot data from the&#xD;
      investigators' laboratory support transfer from VR to real tasks. Thus, the investigators&#xD;
      predict that participants will show significantly higher task accomplishment, fewer errors&#xD;
      and faster completion times from Baseline to Post-Testing on real trained tasks versus real&#xD;
      untrained tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (Exploratory): To explore usability and acceptability of the VR Training and&#xD;
      associations between individual differences variables (e.g., cognitive abilities) and&#xD;
      training effects. These analyses will elucidate mechanisms and identify individuals most&#xD;
      likely to benefit from VR Training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of VR Training and identify the patient&#xD;
      characteristics most strongly associated with training benefits on real life tasks. Data will&#xD;
      be used to inform a future randomized clinical trial using VR tasks that are customized to&#xD;
      participants' daily routines.&#xD;
