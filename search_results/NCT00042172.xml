  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of donepezil (Aricept) for the&#xD;
      treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in elderly adults. This study will also&#xD;
      determine whether adding ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) enhances the effects of donepezil.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognition involves important thinking processes such as perception, learning, and reasoning.&#xD;
      There are currently no definitive treatments for cognitive deterioration. This study focuses&#xD;
      on elderly individuals with MCI because people at a pre-dementia stage may sustain the&#xD;
      greatest and most lasting benefit from cognitive-enhancing agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive either donepezil or placebo for the first 6 months of the study. In the&#xD;
      second 6 months of the study, patients are randomized to receive either donepezil plus GBE or&#xD;
      donepezil alone. Positron Emission Tomography (PET), which provides a color-coded image of&#xD;
      the brain's blood flow in a particular area, is used to assess brain activity during memory&#xD;
      tasks. A PET scan is performed at study entry, 6 months, and 1 year. A vasodilator (a drug&#xD;
      that dilates the blood vessels) is administered during the PET imaging procedure to determine&#xD;
      whether vascular disease affects memory function. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is&#xD;
      also taken to view the brain.&#xD;
