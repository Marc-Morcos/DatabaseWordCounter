    <measure>Change From Baseline Over Time in CDR-SB Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24, Week 48, Week 72, Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR-SB is a numeric scale used to quantify the severity of symptoms of dementia. A qualified health professional assesses a participant's cognitive and functional performance in 6 areas: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The CDR scale gives a score from 0 to 3 for each of the 6 areas, with a lower value being desirable. The sum of these 6 areas, the CDR-SB score, can range from 0 to 18, with a lower value being desirable.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug up to last dose of study drug plus 20 weeks (up to Week 112)</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE was defined as an adverse event (AE) that began on or after the first study drug dose date and no more than 20 weeks after the last dose of study drug. An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Serious AEs (SAEs) were defined as an event that results in death, is life-threatening, results in hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization, is a congenital abnormality, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is an important medical event. Events were rated in severity as mild, moderate, or severe, and were categorized as having a reasonable possibility or no reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48, Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS-MCI-ADL-24 is a 24-item, study partner-based assessment of activities of daily living designed specifically for AD patients and is completed by a trained rater. The scale assesses functional activities such as cooking, household chores, shopping, keeping appointments, social interactions and hobbies. Items are assessed according to whether they were performed in the past 4 weeks and, if so, some items are further assessed as to whether they were performed independently, with supervision, or with physical help. Scores on the ADCS-ADL-MCI range from 0 to 69, where higher score indicates greater capability to carry out activities of daily living.</description>

    <description>The NPI is used to assess changes in the participant's behavior that occurred in a defined period of time (4 weeks). The NPI assesses 12 behavioral domains on the dimensions of frequency and severity. Frequency is rated on a scale where 0 = absent, 1 = occasionally, 2 = often, 3 = frequently, 4 = very frequently. Severity is rated on a scale where 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. For each of the domains, 3 scores are obtained: frequency, severity, and total (product of frequency and severity; ranges from 0 to 12, with a lower score desirable). A total NPI score can be calculated by summing the domain total scores. Total Score ranges from 0 to 144 with a lower score desirable.</description>

          <title>Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score</title>
          <description>The CDR-SB is a numeric scale used to quantify the severity of symptoms of dementia. A qualified health professional assesses a participant's cognitive and functional performance in 6 areas: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The CDR scale gives a score from 0 to 3 for each of the 6 areas, with a lower value being desirable. The sum of these 6 areas, the CDR-SB score, can range from 0 to 18, with a lower value being desirable.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>A TEAE was defined as an adverse event (AE) that began on or after the first study drug dose date and no more than 20 weeks after the last dose of study drug. An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Serious AEs (SAEs) were defined as an event that results in death, is life-threatening, results in hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization, is a congenital abnormality, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is an important medical event. Events were rated in severity as mild, moderate, or severe, and were categorized as having a reasonable possibility or no reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug.</description>

        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. The Total Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 90, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Comprehension of Spoken Language Score</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Comprehension of Spoken Language score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 5, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Constructional Praxis Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 5, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Commands Score</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Commands Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 5, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Delayed Word Recall Score</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Delayed Word Recall Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 10, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Ideational Praxis Score</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Ideational Praxis Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 5, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Ideational Praxis Score</title>
          <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Ideational Praxis Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 5, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Maze Task Score</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Maze Task Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 5, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Number Cancellation Score</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Number Cancellation Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 5, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Naming Score</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Naming Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 5 with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Orientation Score</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Orientation Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 8, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Word Recall - Number of Words Not Recalled Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 10, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Remember Word Recognition Instructions Score</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Remember Word Recognition Instructions Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 5, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Spoken Language Ability Score</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Spoken Language Ability Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 5, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Word Find Difficulty Spontaneous Speech Score</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Word Find Difficulty Spontaneous Speech Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 5, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Word Recognition Score</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Word Recognition Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 12, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADAS-Cog-14 Word Recognition Score</title>
          <description>The ADAS-Cog was designed to assess the cognitive impairments most common in AD. The ADAS-Cog-14 includes the original 11 items from the ADAS-Cog-11 [1. Spoken language ability, 2. Comprehension of spoken language, 3. Recall of test instructions, 4. Word-findings difficulty in spontaneous speech, 5. Following commands, 6. Naming objects and fingers, 7. Constructional praxis, 8. Ideational praxis, 9. Orientation, 10. Word-recall task, 11. Word-recognition task] and includes 3 additional tasks [12. Number cancellation task, 13. Delayed word recall task, 14. Executive functioning], for increased sensitivity in MCI patients. The Word Recognition Score of the ADAS-Cog-14 ranges from 0 to 12, with a higher score representing greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) Score</title>
        <description>The FAQ measures level of assistance (functional disability) needed for carrying out instrumental activities in daily living (iADLs). The FAQ score ranges from 0 - 30 and consists of 10 items (each scored from 0 - 3), which measure a specific iADL in the past 4-weeks: [1) writing checks, paying bills, keeping financial records; 2) assembling tax or business records; 3) shopping alone; 4) playing a game of skill; 5) making coffee or tea; 6) preparing a balanced meal; 7) keeping track of current events; 8) attending to and understanding a television program, book, or magazine; 9) remembering appointments, family occasions, medications; and 10) traveling out of the neighborhood]. Performance in each category is rated from 0 - 3 as follows: 0 - normal; 1 - has difficulty, but does by self; 2 - requires assistance; or 3 - dependent. The FAQ was administered by a trained interviewer. Higher scores indicate a greater requirement of assistance.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-CGIC-MCI) General Condition Score</title>
        <description>The instrument assesses the physician's global impression of change in 4 major cognitive domains. The instrument covers 4 major domains: 1. General condition , 2. Cognition, 3. Behavior, and 4. Social and daily functioning. Scoring is based on a 7-point Likert Scale: 1, marked improvement; 2, moderate improvement; 3, minimal improvement; 4, no change; 5, minimal worsening; 6, moderate worsening; 7, marked worsening. Higher score indicates greater worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADCS-CGIC-MCI Cognition Score</title>
        <description>The instrument assesses the physician's global impression of change in 4 major cognitive domains. The instrument covers 4 major domains: 1. General condition , 2. Cognition, 3. Behavior, and 4. Social and daily functioning. Scoring is based on a 7-point Likert Scale: 1, marked improvement; 2, moderate improvement; 3, minimal improvement; 4, no change; 5, minimal worsening; 6, moderate worsening; 7, marked worsening. Higher score indicates greater worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADCS-CGIC-MCI Behavior Score</title>
        <description>The instrument assesses the physician's global impression of change in 4 major cognitive domains. The instrument covers 4 major domains: 1. General condition , 2. Cognition, 3. Behavior, and 4. Social and daily functioning. Scoring is based on a 7-point Likert Scale: 1, marked improvement; 2, moderate improvement; 3, minimal improvement; 4, no change; 5, minimal worsening; 6, moderate worsening; 7, marked worsening. Higher score indicates greater worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in ADCS-CGIC-MCI Functional Abilities Score</title>
        <description>The instrument assesses the physician's global impression of change in 4 major cognitive domains. The instrument covers 4 major domains: 1. General condition , 2. Cognition, 3. Behavior, and 4. Social and daily functioning (functional abilities). Scoring is based on a 7-point Likert Scale: 1, marked improvement; 2, moderate improvement; 3, minimal improvement; 4, no change; 5, minimal worsening; 6, moderate worsening; 7, marked worsening. Higher score indicates greater worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in 24-Item Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living Scale Adapted for Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL-24) Total Score</title>
        <description>The ADCS-MCI-ADL-24 is a 24-item, study partner-based assessment of activities of daily living designed specifically for AD patients and is completed by a trained rater. The scale assesses functional activities such as cooking, household chores, shopping, keeping appointments, social interactions and hobbies. Items are assessed according to whether they were performed in the past 4 weeks and, if so, some items are further assessed as to whether they were performed independently, with supervision, or with physical help. Scores on the ADCS-ADL-MCI range from 0 to 69, where higher score indicates greater capability to carry out activities of daily living.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) - Total Scale Score</title>
        <description>The RBANS is a 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with North American population-based normative data. The RBANS measures five neurocognitive domains, with age-based scaling. Twelve subtests measure cognitive decline or improvement across the following domains: 1. Immediate Memory - List Learning and Story Memory, 2. Visuospatial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation, 3. Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency, 4. Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. Total score can range from 40 to 160 with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in RBANS - Coding Total Score</title>
        <description>The RBANS is a 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with North American population-based normative data. The RBANS measures five neurocognitive domains, with age-based scaling. Twelve subtests measure cognitive decline or improvement across the following domains: 1. Immediate Memory - List Learning and Story Memory, 2. Visuospatial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation, 3. Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency, 4. Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. The Coding Total Score of the RBANS ranges from 0 to 89, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in RBANS - Digit Span Total Score</title>
        <description>The RBANS is a 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with North American population-based normative data. The RBANS measures five neurocognitive domains, with age-based scaling. Twelve subtests measure cognitive decline or improvement across the following domains: 1. Immediate Memory - List Learning and Story Memory, 2. Visuospatial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation, 3. Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency, 4. Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. The Digit Span Total Score of the RBANS ranges from 0 to 8, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in RBANS - Figure Copy Total Score</title>
        <description>The RBANS is a 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with North American population-based normative data. The RBANS measures five neurocognitive domains, with age-based scaling. Twelve subtests measure cognitive decline or improvement across the following domains: 1. Immediate Memory - List Learning and Story Memory, 2. Visuospatial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation, 3. Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency, 4. Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. The Figure Copy Total Score of the RBANS ranges from 0 to 20, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in RBANS - Figure Recall Total Score</title>
        <description>The RBANS is a 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with North American population-based normative data. The RBANS measures five neurocognitive domains, with age-based scaling. Twelve subtests measure cognitive decline or improvement across the following domains: 1. Immediate Memory - List Learning and Story Memory, 2. Visuospatial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation, 3. Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency, 4. Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. The Figure Recall Total Score of the RBANS ranges from 0 to 18, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in RBANS - List Recognition Total Score</title>
        <description>The RBANS is a 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with North American population-based normative data. The RBANS measures five neurocognitive domains, with age-based scaling. Twelve subtests measure cognitive decline or improvement across the following domains: 1. Immediate Memory - List Learning and Story Memory, 2. Visuospatial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation, 3. Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency, 4. Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. The List Recognition Total Score of the RBANS ranges from 0 to 20, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in RBANS - List Learning Total Score</title>
        <description>The RBANS is a 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with North American population-based normative data. The RBANS measures five neurocognitive domains, with age-based scaling. Twelve subtests measure cognitive decline or improvement across the following domains: 1. Immediate Memory - List Learning and Story Memory, 2. Visuospatial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation, 3. Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency, 4. Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. The List Learning Total Score of the RBANS ranges from 0 to 40, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. The List Learning Total Score of the RBANS ranges from 0 to 40, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in RBANS - Line Orientation Total Score</title>
        <description>The RBANS is a 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with North American population-based normative data. The RBANS measures five neurocognitive domains, with age-based scaling. Twelve subtests measure cognitive decline or improvement across the following domains: 1. Immediate Memory - List Learning and Story Memory, 2. Visuospatial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation, 3. Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency, 4. Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. The Line Orientation Total Score of the RBANS ranges from 0 to 20, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in RBANS - List Recall Total Score</title>
        <description>The RBANS is a 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with North American population-based normative data. The RBANS measures five neurocognitive domains, with age-based scaling. Twelve subtests measure cognitive decline or improvement across the following domains: 1. Immediate Memory - List Learning and Story Memory, 2. Visuospatial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation, 3. Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency, 4. Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. The List Recall Total Score of the RBANS ranges from 0 to 10, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in RBANS - Picture Naming Total Score</title>
        <description>The RBANS is a 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with North American population-based normative data. The RBANS measures five neurocognitive domains, with age-based scaling. Twelve subtests measure cognitive decline or improvement across the following domains: 1. Immediate Memory - List Learning and Story Memory, 2. Visuospatial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation, 3. Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency, 4. Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. The Picture Naming Total Score of the RBANS ranges from 0 to 10, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in RBANS - Semantic Fluency Total Score</title>
        <description>The RBANS is a 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with North American population-based normative data. The RBANS measures five neurocognitive domains, with age-based scaling. Twelve subtests measure cognitive decline or improvement across the following domains: 1. Immediate Memory - List Learning and Story Memory, 2. Visuospatial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation, 3. Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency, 4. Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. The Semantic Fluency Total Score of the RBANS ranges from 0 to 40, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in RBANS - Story Memory Total Score</title>
        <description>The RBANS is a 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with North American population-based normative data. The RBANS measures five neurocognitive domains, with age-based scaling. Twelve subtests measure cognitive decline or improvement across the following domains: 1. Immediate Memory - List Learning and Story Memory, 2. Visuospatial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation, 3. Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency, 4. Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. The Story Memory Total Score of the RBANS ranges from 0 to 24, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in RBANS - Story Recall Total Score</title>
        <description>The RBANS is a 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with North American population-based normative data. The RBANS measures five neurocognitive domains, with age-based scaling. Twelve subtests measure cognitive decline or improvement across the following domains: 1. Immediate Memory - List Learning and Story Memory, 2. Visuospatial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation, 3. Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency, 4. Attention - Digit Span and Coding, and 5. Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall. The Story Recall Total Score of the RBANS ranges from 0 to 12, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <description>The MMSE is a brief, 30-point questionnaire, administered by a trained rater, which provides a quantitative measure of cognitive status in adults and is widely used to screen for cognitive impairment and to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment at a given point in time in AD participants. The MMSE ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater impairment.</description>

          <description>The MMSE is a brief, 30-point questionnaire, administered by a trained rater, which provides a quantitative measure of cognitive status in adults and is widely used to screen for cognitive impairment and to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment at a given point in time in AD participants. The MMSE ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater impairment.</description>
          <population>Intent-to-Treat Data Set: all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Participants with an assessment at baseline and given time point.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in Neuropsychiatry Inventory (NPI) Total Score</title>
        <description>The NPI is used to assess changes in the participant's behavior that occurred in a defined period of time (4 weeks). The NPI assesses 12 behavioral domains on the dimensions of frequency and severity. Frequency is rated on a scale where 0 = absent, 1 = occasionally, 2 = often, 3 = frequently, 4 = very frequently. Severity is rated on a scale where 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. For each of the domains, 3 scores are obtained: frequency, severity, and total (product of frequency and severity; ranges from 0 to 12, with a lower score desirable). A total NPI score can be calculated by summing the domain total scores. Total Score ranges from 0 to 144 with a lower score desirable.</description>
