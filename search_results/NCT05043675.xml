      uptake in subjects with AD dementia&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      -  To expand the safety and tolerability profile for the administration of [18F]APN-1607&#xD;
           and PET scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess regional patterns of [18F]APN-1607 uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the relationship between regional measures of [18F]APN-1607 uptake and&#xD;
           measurements of AD disease severity, such as National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's&#xD;
           Association (NIA-AA) diagnosis, Mini-mental Status Exam (MMSE) score, and Alzheimer's&#xD;
           Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAScog).&#xD;

    <description>[18F]APN-1607 uptake patterns will be assessed in regions of interest (ROIs) which relevant to AD pathology. Standard uptake value (SUV) will be calculated for each ROI, and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) will be calculated by normalizing SUV of ROIs to the SUV of relevant reference region.</description>
