    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the NPI Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>NPI evaluates both frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric disturbances including delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, night time behaviors, as well as appetite/eating. Total domain score= frequency x severity and thus ranges from 1 to 12. NPI domain is rated by caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Frequency is rated as:1=occasionally, 2=often, 3= frequently, and 4=very frequently. Severity is rated as:1=mild,2=moderate,3=severe. Frequency and severity rating scales has defined anchor points to enhance reliability of caregiver responses. Caregiver distress is rated for each positive neuropsychiatric symptom using following anchored scores. It is rated as 0=not at all,1=minimal,2=mild,3=moderate,4=severe,5=very severe. Individual Item scores are added to yield a possible total score of 0 to 144. MMRM was used for the analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DEMQOL scale is used to evaluate health-related QOL in participants with dementia and their caregivers. There are 2 versions of the DEMQOL: a 28-item version (rated by the participant); and a 31-item version (DEMQOL-proxy, rated by the caregiver). Both versions are recommended for evaluating participants (and their caregivers) with mild to moderate dementia. The DEMQOL total score ranges from 28 to 112. The DEMQOL-proxy is used for participants with severe dementia; the total score ranges from 31 to 124. For both versions, higher scores indicate greater QOL. MMRM was used for the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) Composite Score</title>
        <description>The CMAI was used to assess the frequency of manifestations of agitated behaviors in elderly participants. It consists of 29 agitated items rated on a 7-point scale of frequency: 1, never; 2, less than once a week; 3, once or twice a week; 4, several times a week; 5, once or twice a day; 6, several times a day; 7, several times an hour. The CMAI total score ranges from 29 to 203. Higher scores indicate worsening of the condition. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement. Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) was used for the analysis.</description>

        <description>The mADCS-CGIC-Agitation is a modified version of the ADCS-CGIC containing additional questions related to agitation and an assessment of the Clinician's Impression of Change focused specifically on agitation. Participants are asked to rate their impression of change as: 1=Marked Improvement; 2=Moderate Improvement; 3=Minimal Improvement; 4=No Change; 5=Minimal Worsening; 6=Moderate Worsening; 7=Marked Worsening. Higher scores indicate worsening of agitation and positive change from baseline indicates worsening. MMRM was used for the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Agitation/Aggression Domain Score</title>
        <description>The NPI is a retrospective caregiver-informant interview covering 12 neuropsychiatric symptom domains. The Agitation/Aggression domain is designed to collect information on the behavioral aspects of agitation/aggression in participants with probable AD and clinically meaningful agitation secondary to AD. Each NPI domain is rated by the caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Symptom frequency is rated as:1, occasionally; 2, often; 3, frequently; 4, very frequently. Symptom severity is rated as: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. The total domain score is calculated as the frequency score multiplied by the severity score and thus ranges from 1 to 12. Higher scores indicate worsening symptoms. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms. MMRM was used for the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) Score</title>
        <description>The ZBI is a 22-item scale used to assess the impact of a participants' disabilities on the caregiver's life. It is designed to reflect the burden experienced by caregivers of dementia participants and can either be completed by the caregiver or administered as an interview. Each item of the scale is rated to reflect the burden using the 5-point scale: 0=Never; 1=Rarely; 2=Sometimes; 3=Quite Frequently; 4=Nearly Always. The ZBI is scored by summing the responses of the individual questions and ranges from 0 to 88. Higher scores indicate greater caregiver distress. Negative change from baseline indicates less distress. MMRM was used for the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the NPI Irritability/Lability Domain Score</title>
        <description>The NPI is a retrospective interview covering 12 neuropsychiatric symptom domains, including the irritability/lability domain score. Each NPI domain is rated by the caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Symptom frequency is rated as:1, occasionally; 2, often; 3, frequently; 4, very frequently. Symptom severity is rated as:1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. The total domain score is calculated as the frequency score multiplied by the severity score and thus ranges from 1 to 12. Higher scores indicate worsening of the symptoms. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms. MMRM was used for the analysis.</description>

Total domain score= frequency x severity and thus ranges from 1 to 12. NPI domain is rated by caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Frequency is rated as:1=occasionally, 2=often, 3= frequently, and 4=very frequently. Severity is rated as:1=mild,2=moderate,3=severe. Frequency and severity rating scales has defined anchor points to enhance reliability of caregiver responses. Caregiver distress is rated for each positive neuropsychiatric symptom using following anchored scores. It is rated as 0=not at all,1=minimal,2=mild,3=moderate,4=severe,5=very severe. Individual Item scores are added to yield a possible total score of 0 to 144. MMRM was used for the analysis.</description>

        <description>The CGIS-Agitation is an observer-rated scale that measures illness severity. The CGIS-Agitation is a 7-point (1-7) scale (1=normal, not at all ill participants; 7=among the most extremely ill participants) and is assessed for severity of agitation. A value of 0 is given to participants who are not assessed. Higher scores indicate poor health of participants. MMRM was used for the analysis.</description>

        <description>The ADCS-CGIC rating scale provides a reliable means to assess change from a Baseline level of global function within the time frame of the trial. ADCS-CGIC-Overall focuses on the clinician's observations of change in the participant's cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance. The ADCS-CGIC-Overall responses (1-7) are rated as: 1 = marked improvement, 2 = moderate improvement, 3 = minimal improvement, 4 = no change, 5 = minimal worsening, 6 = moderate worsening, or 7 = marked worsening. MMRM was used for the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the Dementia Quality of Life (DEMQOL) Score</title>
        <description>The DEMQOL scale is used to evaluate health-related QOL in participants with dementia and their caregivers. There are 2 versions of the DEMQOL: a 28-item version (rated by the participant); and a 31-item version (DEMQOL-proxy, rated by the caregiver). Both versions are recommended for evaluating participants (and their caregivers) with mild to moderate dementia. The DEMQOL total score ranges from 28 to 112. The DEMQOL-proxy is used for participants with severe dementia; the total score ranges from 31 to 124. For both versions, higher scores indicate greater QOL. MMRM was used for the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) Score</title>
        <description>The CSDD scale is used to assess signs/symptoms of major depression in participants with dementia. CSDD has 19 items, and each item is rated for severity on the following scale of 0 to 2 (0 =absent, 1= mild/intermittent 2=severe). CSDD score is calculated by summing non-missing scores from each item score. The scale ranges from 0 (no depression) to 38 (maximum depression). Scores above 10 indicate a probable major depression, above 18 indicate a definite major depression, and below 6 as a rule are associated with the absence of significant depressive symptoms. Higher score indicated maximum depression. MMRM was used for the analysis.</description>

        <description>The ADAS is designed to evaluate the cognitive and non-cognitive behavioral dysfunction characteristics of participants with AD. The cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) consists of 11 subsets related to memory, praxis, and language. ADAS-cog scores range from 0 to 70. Higher scores indicate greater cognitive impairment. Negative change from baseline indicates less cognitive impairment. MMRM method was used for analysis.</description>

        <population>mITT Population included all randomized participants who had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment. Participants were included in the treatment group to which they were randomized regardless of treatment received.

        <title>Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) Score: Number of Hours Per Day the Caregiver Spent Assisting the Participant</title>
        <description>The RUD evaluates dementia participants' utilization of formal and informal healthcare resources, including hospitalizations and doctor visits, living assistance, and time spent by nonprofessional caregivers. Information on hours per day the caregiver spent assisting participant were reported in this outcome measure, using the following questions:&#xD;
Q1= On a typical care day during the last 30 days, how much time per day did you assist the participant with tasks such as toilet visits, eating, dressing, grooming, walking and bathing? Q2= On a typical care day during the last 30 days, how much time per day did you assist the participant with tasks such as shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, taking medication and managing financial matters? Q3= On a typical care day during the last 30 days, how much time per day did you spend supervising (that is, preventing dangerous events) the participant?</description>

        <description>The RUD evaluates dementia participants' utilization of formal and informal healthcare resources, including hospitalizations, doctor visits, living assistance, and time spent by nonprofessional caregivers. Information on days the caregiver spent assisting participant were reported in this outcome measure, using the following questions:&#xD;
Q1= During the last 30 days, how many days did you spend providing these (toilet visits, eating, dressing, grooming, walking and bathing) services to the participant? Q2= During the last 30 days, how many days did you spend providing these (shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, taking medication and managing financial matters) services to the participant? Q3= During the last 30 days, how many days did you spend providing these services (supervising) to the participant?</description>
