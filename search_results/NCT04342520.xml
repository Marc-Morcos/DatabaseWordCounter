  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving the diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders is a major public health challenge. This&#xD;
      diagnosis occurs too late in the majority of cases, or is even sometimes non-existent for&#xD;
      some despite the presence of clinical signs and symptoms. However, the etiological diagnosis&#xD;
      of a TNC is crucial for the patient and his family to understand the most appropriate&#xD;
      decisions for the future, to plan the organization of his life as long as he is able to do&#xD;
      so, to access the clinical research, to promote dialogue between patients and their&#xD;
      caregivers. On the contrary, a late diagnosis may be responsible for the fact that the&#xD;
      patient and his / her family are less able to benefit from certain psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions, services and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But the diagnostic announcement is retained. One of the negative and dreaded effects of such&#xD;
      an announcement is the negative psychological impact. Some studies show that the diagnostic&#xD;
      announcement would worsen the level of anxiety or depressed mood and the risk of social&#xD;
      isolation. On the other hand, other studies show that symptoms such as anxiety, psychic&#xD;
      distress and depression remain stable, or even decrease slightly after the announcement of&#xD;
      the diagnosis, in patients and their relatives. However, the literature is questionable&#xD;
      because the majority of the studies are retrospective, mono-centric, and the patient numbers&#xD;
      are low. While the first reactions of patients may be negative after the announcement, some&#xD;
      report resignation experiences, or form of relief, because they have finally found a clinical&#xD;
      explanation for the symptoms encountered. While doubt or diagnostic uncertainty, as well as&#xD;
      the feeling of not knowing the truth, seem to have a more damaging psychological impact on&#xD;
      the patient and those around him, increasing anxiety and confusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to study if the level of anxiety 2 months after the announcement of&#xD;
      the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or a related disease is not superior to the level of&#xD;
      anxiety before the announcement with patient / caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This present study aim to explore the feasibility with 14 patients.&#xD;
