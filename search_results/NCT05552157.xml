  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate the biomarker effect, safety, and tolerability of investigational&#xD;
      study drugs in participants who are known to have an Alzheimer's disease (AD)-causing&#xD;
      mutation. Part 1 will determine if treatment with the study drug prevents or slows the rate&#xD;
      of amyloid beta (Aβ) pathological disease accumulation demonstrated by Aβ positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) imaging. Part 2 will evaluate the effect of early Aβ plaque&#xD;
      reduction/prevention on disease progression by assessing downstream non-Aβ biomarkers of AD&#xD;
      (e.g., CSF total tau, p-tau, NfL) compared to an external control group from the DIAN-OBS&#xD;
      natural history study and the DIAN-TU-001 placebo-treated participants.&#xD;

      This study will recruit participants from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network&#xD;
      observational study (DIAN-OBS), a multicenter international study supported by the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health (Grant Number U01-AG032438; RJ Bateman), Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer&#xD;
      Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) sites, DIAN-TU partner sites, DIAN Expanded Registry&#xD;
      (DIAN-EXR), and families identified by the sites. As part of the DIAN-TU-002 protocol,&#xD;
      participants undergo longitudinal assessments that include clinical assessment, cognitive&#xD;
      testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid imaging, and analysis of cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in DIAN are recruited from families that have at least one member who has been&#xD;
      identified as having a mutation linked to dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD).&#xD;
      The mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and amyloid precursor protein&#xD;
      (APP) genes that are associated with DIAD have very high penetrance (near 100%). This study&#xD;
      will enroll individuals who are either known to have a known disease-causing mutation, or who&#xD;
      are at risk for such a mutation (the child or sibling of a proband with a known mutation) and&#xD;
      unaware of their genetic status. Because the age at onset of cognitive changes is relatively&#xD;
      consistent within each family and for each mutation, an age at onset is determined for each&#xD;
      affected parent or mutation as part of the DIAN-OBS study protocol. This study will enroll&#xD;
      participants who are asymptomatic and are within a specific window of time of expected age at&#xD;
      onset for their family and/or mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a high&#xD;
      degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of therapies at&#xD;
      asymptomatic and very early stages of dementia. Families with known disease-causing mutations&#xD;
      are extremely rare and are geographically dispersed throughout the world. These constraints&#xD;
      necessitate a specialized study design. Participants in this study will not yet have&#xD;
      developed any symptoms of AD; they will be &quot;asymptomatic&quot; carriers of mutations that cause&#xD;
      DIAD and would be expected to perform normally on standard cognitive and functional testing.&#xD;
      Further, most mutation carriers will have levels of AD-associated amyloid beta (Aβ) and&#xD;
      non-Aβ biomarkers that are the same as non-carriers. Imaging and fluid biomarkers will be&#xD;
      used to demonstrate that the treatment compounds have engaged their therapeutic targets. A&#xD;
      set of cognitive measures designed to assess the very earliest and most subtle cognitive&#xD;
      changes will be collected. However, the goal of this study is to address whether decreasing&#xD;
      plaque prone Aβ peptides in the absence of measurable or mild elevations of Aβ plaques in&#xD;
      participants with minimal to no amyloid plaque at baseline can lead to the subsequent&#xD;
      prevention of non-Aβ biomarkers of disease progression. Additionally, because many at-risk&#xD;
      individuals decide not to know whether they have the disease-associated mutation, some of the&#xD;
      at-risk individuals enrolled in this study will not have the disease-causing mutations; they&#xD;
      will be &quot;mutation-negative.&quot; It is important to enroll these participants to avoid coercion&#xD;
      (e.g., potential participants may feel pressured into genetic testing to learn their genetic&#xD;
      status to be eligible for the trial). These mutation-negative individuals will be assigned to&#xD;
      the placebo group and data will be used to determine normal ranges of outcome. Participants&#xD;
      and site study staff will remain blinded as to these individuals' active or placebo group&#xD;
      assignment and mutation status. Thus, the study will be blinded for placebo and for mutation&#xD;
      status, except for mutation carriers who are aware of their genetic status. There may be&#xD;
      exceptional circumstances as required by local regulation or health authorities where&#xD;
      enrollment may be restricted to mutation carriers only, but such mandates will be thoroughly&#xD;
      documented and agreed upon by the governing regulatory agency and the study sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an adaptive-platform-based study. Several different therapies (each referred to&#xD;
      as a study drug arm) may be tested in order to increase the likelihood that an effective&#xD;
      treatment will be discovered. The compounds are selected for this trial based on mechanism of&#xD;
      action and available data on efficacy and safety profile. In the case of multiple study arms,&#xD;
      the study design includes a pooled placebo group (referred to as the mutation positive&#xD;
      placebos) shared by all study drug arms. Mutation carriers will be assigned to a study drug&#xD;
      arm and subsequently randomized within that arm in an overall 1:1 ratio to active drug:&#xD;
      placebo. Mutation-negative participants will all receive placebo treatment. Participants and&#xD;
      study staff will not be blinded as to which study drug arm each participant has been&#xD;
      assigned; they will be blinded to whether participants have been randomized to receive active&#xD;
      drug or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 2 treatment periods: Part 1 is a blinded placebo-controlled period that will&#xD;
      continue until the last randomized participant completes 4 years of treatment (i.e., a common&#xD;
      close design), and Part 2 is an open-label period of 4 years (with a planned 2-year interim&#xD;
      efficacy analysis) in which all mutation carriers will receive active drug. At the start of&#xD;
      Part 2, participants who were randomized to placebo in Part 1 will follow the same dose&#xD;
      titration schedule and MRI safety schedule used in Part 1. Participants who were randomized&#xD;
      to active drug in Part 1 will follow a mock dose titration and will have the same MRI safety&#xD;
      schedule used during the initial drug titration as Part 1 but will remain on the dose that&#xD;
      they were on at the end of Part 1. This will protect the blind to the original treatment&#xD;
      assignment from Part 1. Participants, investigators, and the sponsor's clinical team will&#xD;
      remain blinded throughout the study to the Part 1 treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study is designed to test whether the study drug can slow, prevent, or reverse&#xD;
      progression of Aβ pathology associated with AD and Part 2 is designed to assess the study&#xD;
      drug's effect on non-amyloid biomarkers of AD that may lead to future slowing or prevention&#xD;
      of clinical symptoms of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker, cognitive, and/or clinical endpoints will be specified for each study drug arm.&#xD;
      Biomarker data will be analyzed for pre-specified endpoints consistent with the drug's&#xD;
      mechanism of action and other AD biomarker outcomes. The clinical and cognitive assessments&#xD;
      are designed to assess subtle cognitive changes that may be detectable before the onset of&#xD;
      dementia as well as cognitive and clinical decline in symptomatic groups.&#xD;
