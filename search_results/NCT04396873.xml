      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 5 million adults in the U.S. have Alzheimer s disease or another adult-onset&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disorder. Many studies have found that inflammation in the brain&#xD;
      contributes to these diseases. Researchers want to find a better way to measure this&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn whether COX-1 and/or COX-2 is elevated in the brains of individuals with&#xD;
      neurodegenerative brain disease compared to healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 years and older in good general health who have an adult-onset&#xD;
      neurodegenerative dementia, such as AD, FTD, corticobasal syndrome, or Huntington s disease&#xD;
      and healthy adult volunteers enrolled in protocols 01-M-0254 or 17-M-0181.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam with vital signs, and lab&#xD;
      tests. They will have a neuropsychological testing. Their heart function will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The MRI scanner is a metal&#xD;
      tube surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides in&#xD;
      and out of the tube. The machine makes noise. Participants will get earplugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 PET scans. They will be injected with the study drugs through an&#xD;
      intravenous catheter placed in an arm vein. The PET scanner is shaped like a doughnut.&#xD;
      Participants will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the scanner. A plastic mask will be&#xD;
      molded to their head to keep them from moving. A thin plastic tube will be put into an artery&#xD;
      at the wrist or elbow crease area. This will be used to draw blood during the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2-3 study visits. Participation lasts 1 week to 4 months, depending on&#xD;
      scheduling.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot/exploratory study will examine whether cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and COX-2 are&#xD;
      elevated in the brains of individuals with neurodegenerative brain disease compared to&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine whether COX-1 and/or COX-2 is elevated in the brains of&#xD;
      individuals with neurodegenerative brain disease compared to healthy volunteers. Secondary&#xD;
      Objective: 1) To determine retest variability and reliability for each radioligand. 2) To&#xD;
      evaluate the specific binding of [11C]PS13 to COX-1 in healthy subjects through blocking&#xD;
      study using Ketoprofen, a COX-1 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Measurement of COX-1 and COX-2 density in brain after PET scans with&#xD;
      [11C]PS13 and [11C]MC1, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: To measure whole-brain distribution volume (VT) of COX-1 and COX-2 in a&#xD;
      retest setting; 2) To correlate VT with the presence of amyloid in AD patients 3) To&#xD;
      calculate the specific binding of [11C]PS13 with a Lassen plot&#xD;
