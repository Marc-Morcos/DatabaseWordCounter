    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and currently has no disease&#xD;
      modifying treatments or simple accurate diagnostic tests. The goal of this project is to&#xD;
      study how amyloid-beta (a protein thought to cause AD) is made, transported and cleared in&#xD;
      the human body. Better understanding of these processes may lead to improved understanding of&#xD;
      AD, earlier diagnosis and a way to evaluate treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal is to determine the changes that occur in amyloid-beta (Aβ) metabolism in&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and model the production, transport, metabolism and clearance of Aβ&#xD;
      in the human central nervous system (CNS) and periphery to improve clinical trial designs and&#xD;
      also possibly develop an AD blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clearance of brain Aβ occurs by enzymatic digestion (e.g. Insulin Degrading Enzyme,&#xD;
      Neprilysin, etc.), cellular uptake and breakdown, transport across the blood-brain-barrier,&#xD;
      and transport from the brain to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and then to blood. However, the&#xD;
      relationship between CNS Aβ and blood Aβ is not known in humans and only partly understood in&#xD;
      other animals. The goal is to determine the kinetics of Aβ in the CNS and blood to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that altered Aβ kinetics in the CNS in AD is associated with altered blood Aβ&#xD;
      labeling kinetics. Understanding blood and CSF Aβ kinetics will contribute to a better&#xD;
      understanding of Aβ production, transport, and breakdown within and between the brain, CSF&#xD;
      and blood compartments. These fundamental measurements of Aβ kinetics in AD will help&#xD;
      determine the effects of peripheral Aβ metabolism on pathophysiologic changes in AD. This&#xD;
      information will provide key insights into whole body Aβ metabolism and will be useful for&#xD;
      understanding the causes of AD. Further, these results may lead to a specific blood biomarker&#xD;
      for AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To determine blood Aβ isoform SILK (stable isotope-linked kinetics) using existing&#xD;
      steady state infusion labeled blood samples from amyloid positive and amyloid negative&#xD;
      control participants. Blood Aβ kinetics will be compared to CSF Aβ kinetics and combined&#xD;
      utilizing multi-compartment and structural models to determine the direction and magnitude of&#xD;
      transport and breakdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current labeling methods employ a primed continuous infusion which labels Aβ to near&#xD;
      steady-state. In order to provide additional kinetic information on Aβ kinetics and&#xD;
      potentially better distinguish AD from controls, an alternative pulse labeling protocol is&#xD;
      proposed. In addition to providing clearer information on Aβ transport and clearance, the&#xD;
      simplified labeling method makes blood Aβ kinetics feasible as a clinical test for treatment&#xD;
      trials or as a diagnostic test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To perform pulse bolus labeling in amyloid positive and amyloid negative controls and&#xD;
      measure CSF Aβ isoform kinetics and blood Aβ isoform kinetics. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      to complete a pulse labeling study. Results from Aim 2 will be incorporated into&#xD;
      complimentary models with results from Aim 1 and ongoing studies to provide measures of Aβ&#xD;
      production, transport, and breakdown within and between the brain, CSF and blood&#xD;
      compartments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: Based on preliminary data and published studies, the hypothesis will be tested that&#xD;
      blood Aβ isoform kinetics are disrupted in AD and to model the Aβ production, transport and&#xD;
      clearance between the brain and periphery. The data from these studies will be useful to&#xD;
      model the production, transport and breakdown of Aβ throughout the human body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of these aims will be utilized in complimentary modeling approaches and combined with&#xD;
      the results of prior studies to provide a comprehensive model of in vivo Aβ kinetics in both&#xD;
      the human CNS and periphery. The data and models will be able to confirm and exclude current&#xD;
      hypotheses of human Aβ metabolism. The goals of the aims are to determine the CNS Aβ isoform&#xD;
      kinetics with a pulse labeling protocol (Aim 1), and to determine the peripheral blood Aβ&#xD;
      isoform kinetics with a pulse labeling protocol (Aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design: A pulse labeling protocol with twenty participants was completed to&#xD;
      simplify labeling. Pulse labeling experiments provided additional kinetics results to&#xD;
      determine Aβ kinetic models. Of the next sixty participants most will be re-enrolled that&#xD;
      have completed prior intravenous steady-state labeling Aβ SILK studies. All participants will&#xD;
      have had a PET/PIB scan completed for fibrillar amyloid deposition measurements or CSF Aβ42&#xD;
      concentration measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Study: A single pulse dose of leucine will be given at the beginning of the study&#xD;
      and blood and/or CSF will be collected for 24-36 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: We will compare the pulse labeling blood Aβ SILK results of the amyloid&#xD;
      positive vs. amyloid negative control group for Aβ38, Aβ40, Aβ42, and ratios of isoforms vs.&#xD;
      tests of amyloidosis such as PET/PIB scan and/or CSF Aβ42 concentration.&#xD;
