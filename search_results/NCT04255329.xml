  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairements in Alzheimer's and apparented disorders may lead to the decreased&#xD;
      engagement in activities, spetially in moderate and advanced stages of evolution. The lack of&#xD;
      stimulation for people with dementia is associated with the risk of challenging behaviors,&#xD;
      depressives symptoms, sleeping disorders or faster cognitive deterioration. Those challenges&#xD;
      may lead to the increased administration of pharmacological treatments, though the risks of&#xD;
      neurleptics use in this population are currently known. In this context, non-pharacological&#xD;
      interventions hold a significant place in dementia care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research focuses on cognitve stimulation activities. More precisly, our study compares&#xD;
      two aproaches using the reading groups. The first type (&quot; usual &quot; reading group) is based on&#xD;
      the principle of stimulating those cognitive functions which dicreases with the evolution of&#xD;
      dementia. The second (Montessori reading group) approach relies on the idea to use preserved&#xD;
      capacities in order to compensate the cognitive impariments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to compare the impact of these two non-pharmalogical interventions on&#xD;
      non-verbal communication. The collected datas will help analyzing and understanding the&#xD;
      internal and behavioral states of people living with dementia. Our study will also extend&#xD;
      relfexions about cognitive stimulation groups in care institutions.&#xD;

    <description>The leader of the activity reads aloud a text to four participants seated around the table. The readen text is a normal, currently used in a everyday life support such as a journal article. Consequently it is not previously adaptated to people with cognitive impairements. After the reading phase, the leader asks the participants the questions about the content.</description>

    <description>Such book is written in a way to adaptate to people with cognitif and sensory impairments. Indeed, text is written in large characters and structured to not involve episodic memory. Each person read one page aloud in his turn. After the reading phase, the participants discuss the questions about their opinions and distant memories.</description>
