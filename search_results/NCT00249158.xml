      The purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness of an oral formulation of&#xD;
      risperidone (an antipsychotic medication) to that of placebo for treating behavioral and&#xD;
      psychological signs and symptoms in dementia (BPSSD), specifically aggression, delusions, and&#xD;
      hallucinations, in patients with dementia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dementia is a term used for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of&#xD;
      diseases or injuries that affect the brain. Individuals with dementia have a loss of function&#xD;
      in cognition (thinking, perception, learning, verbal communication, memory, judgment), which&#xD;
      may lead to behavioral and personality changes (for example, agitation, delusions,&#xD;
      hallucinations). Some causes of dementia are reversible; however, irreversible dementia is&#xD;
      caused by certain conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. Dementia is common in elderly&#xD;
      individuals, but it is not a normal part of aging. This is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      parallel-group, placebo-controlled study comparing the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      risperidone to placebo in patients with behavioral disturbances associated with dementia. The&#xD;
      study is composed of two periods: a 1-week run-in period in which patients are discontinued&#xD;
      from other antipsychotic drugs and take placebo twice daily and a 12-week double-blind&#xD;
      period. At the end of the run-in period, patients are randomly assigned to oral solutions of&#xD;
      either risperidone or placebo. The starting dose of risperidone is 0.25 mg twice daily and&#xD;
      increasing to 0.5 mg twice daily (1 mg/day). If 1 mg/day shows an insufficient response, a&#xD;
      maximum of 1 mg twice daily of risperidone is permitted. The patient receives study drugs for&#xD;
      the 12-week double-blind period. The primary measure of effectiveness is the change from&#xD;
      baseline to the end of double-blind treatment in the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory&#xD;
      (CMAI), a questionnaire evaluating agitation. Additional measures of efficacy include the&#xD;
      change from baseline to end of double-blind treatment in the Behavior Pathology in&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), a rating scale used to evaluate behavior&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease; the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), a&#xD;
      rating system used to evaluate the overall and severity of clinical change in a patient with&#xD;
      various diseases affecting the brain; the Functional Assessment Staging (FAST), a diagnosis&#xD;
      tool for determining the stage of dementia; and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a&#xD;
      clinical measure used to evaluate cognition. Safety evaluations include the incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events; results of clinical laboratory tests (hematology and biochemistry);&#xD;
      measurements of vital signs and body weight; physical examination findings; and the&#xD;
      Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS), a scale used to measure effects of antipsychotic&#xD;
      medications on motor functions of the patient. The study hypothesis is that risperidone is&#xD;
      more effective than placebo, as measured by the total aggression score on the CMAI, in&#xD;
      treating behavioral disturbances in demented patients. Risperidone oral solution (1 mg/mL).&#xD;
      Starting doses of 0.25 mg twice daily and increasing to 0.5 mg twice daily (1 mg/day). If 1&#xD;
      mg/day shows an insufficient response, a maximum of 1 mg twice daily of risperidone is&#xD;
      permitted. Total treatment duration is 12 weeks.&#xD;
