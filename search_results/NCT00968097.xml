      The main objectives of this proposal are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the dynamic uptake and washout of 123-I MNI-340, a potential imaging biomarker for&#xD;
      β-amyloid burden in brain, using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in&#xD;
      similarly aged Alzheimer's (AD) subjects and healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform blood metabolite characterization of 123-I MNI-340 in healthy and AD subjects to&#xD;
      determine the metabolic fate and nature of metabolites in assessment of 123-I MNI-340 as a&#xD;
      single photon computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging agent&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a common disorder of the aging brain causing progressive and&#xD;
      irreversible impairment in memory and cognitive function. Beginning with the initial&#xD;
      description of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) in 1906 when abnormal accumulations of plaques and&#xD;
      tangles in the brain of a woman with severe cognitive impairment were first noted, the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of AD has been intimately associated with a progressive neuropathologic&#xD;
      process involving abnormal protein deposition in brain. More recent work has implicated the&#xD;
      accumulation of β-amyloid as an early feature of AD, which may be directly responsible for&#xD;
      some of the clinical manifestations of the disease. Pathologic studies suggest levels of&#xD;
      β-amyloid are elevated even in cases classified as having questionable dementia (CDR score =&#xD;
      0.5), and increases in amyloid are strongly correlated with cognitive decline. Increases in&#xD;
      β-amyloid precede significant tau pathology suggesting the formation of plaques early in the&#xD;
      disease may be of clinical importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently post-mortem examination of brain tissues was the only means available for&#xD;
      directly evaluating the changes occurring in the brain in AD and related neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases. In the last decade, the development of highly specific techniques for imaging the&#xD;
      brain in AD has expanded our ability to measure the process of the disease over time in a&#xD;
      living individual. Briefly, these techniques involve intravenous administration of&#xD;
      radioactively-labeled compounds which bind to selective target sites in brain. The&#xD;
      scintigraphic imaging methods PET (positron emission tomography) or SPECT (single photon&#xD;
      emission computed tomography) are able to detect the spatial distribution of the radioactive&#xD;
      compound in the brain and can be used as an objective, sensitive, and accurate method to&#xD;
      quantify the concentration of the targets site in different brain regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using these techniques, β-amyloid aggregates have been successfully imaged in several studies&#xD;
      in AD patients using high affinity 11-C and 18-F-labeled PET tracers (PIB and FDDNP, AV-1).&#xD;
      More recently, another tracer, based on a thioflavin-S derivative,&#xD;
      6-iodo-2-(4'-dimethylamino-)phenyl-imidazol[1,2-a]pyridine, IMPY, labeled with 123-I has been&#xD;
      used to image amyloid. MNI-340 has a similar structure to PIB, but the 123-I radioactive tag&#xD;
      offers distinct advantages for large-scale clinical imaging studies of β -amyloid plaque&#xD;
      targeted treatments as a marker of plaque burden and efficacy of therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
      The longer half-life (13.1 h) of 123-I permits imaging in multiple subjects in a single&#xD;
      research-dedicated imaging center. This minimizes variability introduced in multicenter&#xD;
      quantitative imaging trials where different cameras, image processing methods, and QA&#xD;
      procedures all conspire to increase the variance imaging biomarkers. Using this model, our&#xD;
      group pioneered a method to evaluate the loss of dopamine function in Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      using a radioactive drug 123-I β-CIT, which binds directly to dopamine nerve terminals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adaptation of imaging agents like 123-I MNI-340 as a biomarker of β-amyloid deposition in&#xD;
      AD patients for assessing disease requires human validation studies. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to develop and characterize 123-I MNI-340 as an objective biomarker in AD. The&#xD;
      significance of this work lies in applying state-of-art quantitative neuroimaging tools to&#xD;
      develop a relevant biomarker in living AD patients. In this context we propose to investigate&#xD;
      the feasibility of applying this technique as an imaging biomarker of disease in AD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Design and Methods. The underlying goal of this study is to assess 123-I MNI-340&#xD;
      SPECT imaging as a tool to detect ß-amyloid deposition in the brain of AD research&#xD;
      participants and age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. All study procedures will be&#xD;
      conducted at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders (IND) and Molecular NeuroImaging&#xD;
      (MNI) in New Haven, CT. Approximately 10 patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) and 10&#xD;
      similarly aged healthy controls will be recruited to participate in this study. Healthy&#xD;
      controls will be screened to ensure that there is no evidence of cognitive decline or&#xD;
      significant neurological deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained for all subjects. All subjects will undergo a screening&#xD;
      evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline physical and&#xD;
      neurological evaluation and baseline cognitive evaluations. Subjects will be given a bolus&#xD;
      injection of 123-I MNI-340 in an antecubital vein. Subjects will undergo serial SPECT imaging&#xD;
      scans and serial venous plasma sampling for measurement of 123-I MNI-340 in plasma (both&#xD;
      protein bound and free) over a period of up to 8 hours. The quantitative and visual imaging&#xD;
      analyses will be performed by an image-processing specialist who will remain blinded to any&#xD;
      clinical information.including diagnosis. The primary imaging outcome measure will be the&#xD;
      brain regional distribution volumes expressed as a brain tissue to plasma ratio of the&#xD;
      radioligand, 123-I MNI-340. Time to the peak uptake and amplitude of the peak uptake will be&#xD;
      evaluated for all brain regions and the results for the AD patients and controls will be&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
