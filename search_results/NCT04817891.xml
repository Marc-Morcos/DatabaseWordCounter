  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluctuations in alertness are very common in persons with Lewy body dementias and are a major&#xD;
      source of disability. Changes in a chemical messenger molecule called acetylcholine within&#xD;
      certain brain regions may play a role in these fluctuations. We propose to test this&#xD;
      hypothesis and also determine whether a non-invasive way of stimulating affected brain&#xD;
      regions may be of relevance for future management of these fluctuations.&#xD;

      The central premise of the research study is that cholinergic system changes in specific&#xD;
      neural network regions underlie cognitive fluctuations in patients with LBD. The&#xD;
      cingulo-opercular task control (COTC) neural network is believed to play a role in&#xD;
      maintenance of alertness but this remains uncertain in LDB. This critical knowledge gap forms&#xD;
      the basis of our first aim. The study proposes to use transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) to &quot;excite&quot; critical cholinergic denervation components of the COTC as an adjunct to&#xD;
      cholinergic pharmacotherapy in a target engagement study. tDCS is an emerging non-invasive&#xD;
      neurostimulation technology that may improve a range of neurological symptoms, including&#xD;
      cognition. The study will evaluate whether target engagement by tDCS excitation of&#xD;
      cholinergic denervated COTC hubs may affect cognitive fluctuations in LBD subjects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LBD patients (DLB or PDD) who have cognitive fluctuations and who are on stable doses&#xD;
             of cholinesterase inhibitors (i.e., at least 4 weeks) will be recruited to participate&#xD;
             in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DLB patients will meet the Fourth consensus report of the DLB Consortium inclusion&#xD;
             criteria for probable DLB.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be identified according to the following recognized DLB features:&#xD;
             spontaneous parkinsonian motor signs, fluctuating attention and concentration,&#xD;
             recurrent well-formed visual hallucinations, presence of REM behavioral sleep&#xD;
             disturbance, anosmia/hyposmia,or autonomic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PDD patients will meet the criteria by Emre et al. (Cognitive deficits in at least two&#xD;
             of four of the following cognitive domains: Impaired attention, impaired executive&#xD;
             functions, impairment in visuo-spatial functions, impaired free recall memory&#xD;
             typically improved with cuing. Must also meet criteria for at least one behavioral&#xD;
             symptom: apathy, depressed or anxious mood, hallucinations, delusions, excessive&#xD;
             daytime sleepiness). Lack of behavioral symptoms does not exclude the diagnosis. Must&#xD;
             also have none of Group III features present: (1) Co-existance of any other&#xD;
             abnormality which might cause impairment, but judged not to be the cause of dementia.&#xD;
             (2) Time interval between development of motor and cognitive symptoms not known. Must&#xD;
             also have none of Group IV symptoms present: (1) Cognitive and behavioral symptoms&#xD;
             appear solely in the context of other conditions such as acute confusion caused by&#xD;
             systemic diseases or abnormalities, drug intoxication, or major depression according&#xD;
             to DSM IV. (2) Features compatible with Probable Vascular Dementia criteria&#xD;
             accordingly to NINDS-AIREN.&#xD;
