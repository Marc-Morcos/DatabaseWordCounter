      The main objectives of this proposal are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the dynamic uptake and washout of 123-I MNI-308, a potential imaging biomarker for&#xD;
      β-amyloid burden in brain, using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in&#xD;
      similarly aged Alzheimer's (AD) subjects and healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform blood metabolite characterization of 123-I MNI-308 in healthy and AD subjects to&#xD;
      determine the metabolic fate and nature of metabolites in assessment of 123-I MNI-308 as a&#xD;
      single photon computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the test/retest reproducibility of 123-I MNI-308 and SPECT in AD subjects and&#xD;
      healthy control&#xD;

      General Design and Methods. The underlying goal of this study is to assess 123-I MNI-308&#xD;
      SPECT imaging as a tool to detect ß-amyloid deposition in the brain of AD research&#xD;
      participants and age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. All study procedures will be&#xD;
      conducted at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders (IND) and Molecular NeuroImaging&#xD;
      (MNI) in New Haven, CT. Approximately 10 patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) and 6 healthy&#xD;
      controls (within +/- 2 years) will be recruited to participate in this study. Healthy&#xD;
      controls will be examined to ensure that there is no evidence of neurodegenerative changes&#xD;
      including cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interval of at least 14 days will lapse between dosing in the first four AD subjects. This&#xD;
      is intended to provide a longer period for AE assessments. Once complete, absent any serious&#xD;
      adverse events in these initial AD subjects, dosing may commence with the remainder of the&#xD;
      subjects, including healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained for all subjects. All subjects will undergo a screening&#xD;
      evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline physical and&#xD;
      neurological evaluation and baseline cognitive evaluations. Subjects will be asked to undergo&#xD;
      a bolus injection of 123-I MNI-308. Subjects will undergo serial SPECT imaging scans and&#xD;
      serial venous plasma sampling for measurement of 123-I MNI-308 in plasma (both protein bound&#xD;
      and free) over a period of up to 8 hours. The imaging analyses will be performed by an&#xD;
      image-processing specialist who will remain masked to the procedures employed with each&#xD;
      imaging acquisition. The primary imaging outcome measure will be the brain regional&#xD;
      distribution volumes expressed as a brain tissue to plasma ratio of the radioligand, 123-I&#xD;
      MNI-308. Time to the peak uptake and amplitude of the peak uptake will be evaluated for all&#xD;
      brain regions and the results for the AD patients and controls will be compared.&#xD;
