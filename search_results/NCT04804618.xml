      This study intends to adopt standardized and rigorous cross-sectional research, collect&#xD;
      biological specimens (including blood, feces, urine, saliva and tongue coating) from eligible&#xD;
      subjects, and use liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology to explore&#xD;
      early warning indicators of protein in patients with mild cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The problem of population aging is getting worse, the prevalence of senile dementia is&#xD;
      increasing, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. There is no&#xD;
      effective treatment for AD. Most interventions can only alleviate the condition and delay the&#xD;
      development. Therefore, early diagnosis and prevention of AD are extremely important.&#xD;
      However, the current diagnostic measures are not suitable for clinical promotion due to their&#xD;
      traumatic nature, so there is an urgent need for a more suitable clinical early&#xD;
      identification and diagnosis method. Proteomics research technology is the leading research&#xD;
      technology in China. It can be applied to research on disease markers, pathogenesis, and drug&#xD;
      target discovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study intends to adopt standardized and rigorous cross-sectional research,&#xD;
      collect biological specimens (including blood, feces, urine, saliva and tongue coating) from&#xD;
      eligible subjects, and use liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology to&#xD;
      explore early warning indicators of protein in patients with mild cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
