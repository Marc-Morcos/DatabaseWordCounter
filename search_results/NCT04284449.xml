      An observational study to determine outcomes of older adults who are under naturopathic&#xD;
      medical care for cognitive complaints at a specific clinic in Southern California.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study will examine patient outcomes associated with&#xD;
      individualized, whole-system integrative medical care, provided by a naturopathic physician&#xD;
      at a specific clinic in the state of California. Participants will be older adult patients of&#xD;
      the clinic who present with objectively measurable cognitive dysfunction, and who elect to&#xD;
      voluntarily participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' cognitive function will be assessed using validated objective (NIH Toolbox) and&#xD;
      subjective (NIH Neuro-Quality of Life questionnaires) instruments. The primary outcomes are&#xD;
      change from baseline to six months post-baseline in these two instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, physical activity and sleep data will be tracked using wearable telemetry, and&#xD;
      neurophysiological parameters will be measured with electroencephalography. Detailed&#xD;
      treatment descriptions and adverse events will be tracked.&#xD;
