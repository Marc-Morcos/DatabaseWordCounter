  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The protocol is organized into three Phases - In Phase I an online training program will be&#xD;
      developed in &quot;Care of Persons with Dementia in their Environments&quot; (COPE) -an evidence-based&#xD;
      bio-behavioral dementia program -using state-of-the science simulation and best online&#xD;
      learning practices. In addition an automated approach to fidelity monitoring using&#xD;
      computational linguistics (automatic classification programs) will be developed. In Phase II,&#xD;
      ten long term care community-based (PACE) organizations will be randomized into two groups; 5&#xD;
      PACE organizations will serve as the &quot;control&quot; site in which staff training will be provided&#xD;
      via the traditional high intensity face-to-face training in the COPE program. 5 PACE&#xD;
      organizations will serve as the comparison and staff will be trained using the online COPE&#xD;
      training program. Phase II will evaluate the whether an online training program is the same&#xD;
      or better in improving PACE staff competency and fidelity to COPE principles and protocols&#xD;
      compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training. In Phase III the&#xD;
      efficacy of the COPE program on PACE participant outcomes by type of COPE training will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Each of the PACE organizations will enroll 5 persons with dementia and their&#xD;
      caregivers in the study. This will yield 50 family dyads (25 dyads in traditional training&#xD;
      sites and 25 dyads in online training sites). Dyads will be followed for 4 months.&#xD;
      Non-inferiority analysis will be used to assess whether dyads will yield the same or better&#xD;
      outcomes regardless of how PACE staff were trained.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PHASE 1a - The Online Training Program - We will develop ten self-paced online learning&#xD;
      modules. These modules will enable OTs and RNs to participant to have anytime/anywhere access&#xD;
      to content and activities to aid their learning. The modules will include rich multimedia&#xD;
      content and interactive assessments to keep the learner engaged. The modules will allow for&#xD;
      easy packaging of the content into the latest interoperability standards for such content&#xD;
      including the latest Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) specifications, which&#xD;
      will allow for repurposing and sharing with other institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accommodate diversity of learning needs, the modules will be designed using a&#xD;
      hyperlearning model with four dimensions. The general principles will begin with the module&#xD;
      learning objectives and follow with a review of core concepts and required and/or&#xD;
      self-directed learning activities. The mini-lecture component of the modules will include&#xD;
      information on the major concepts of the module. Since the modules will be self-paced, the&#xD;
      learner can take his/her time going through them and perform in the embedded interactive&#xD;
      learning activities. The clinical reasoning dimension will provide the learner with an&#xD;
      opportunity for problem-solving and clinical decision-making. This dimension will contain&#xD;
      vignettes and case studies with questions requiring analysis and synthesis. The final&#xD;
      dimension will be evaluation/ assessment of learning outcomes. This dimension will use&#xD;
      teacher-made and standardized pre-and post-tests to assess attainment of specified learning&#xD;
      outcomes. The self-paced modules will be highly interactive featuring integrated multimedia&#xD;
      content, assessments, and learner evaluations to allow PACE staff to engage with the content&#xD;
      at a high level and practice application in simulated scenarios. Each module will require&#xD;
      approximately 45-60 minutes/module for the learner to complete. Participants can use the&#xD;
      modules separately at different times throughout a training curriculum or they can be&#xD;
      assigned at the beginning of a training time by having this information front-loaded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop the modules, we will work intensely in year 01 with an instructional design team&#xD;
      at Drexel University with specialists in dementia care, the COPE program and experts in&#xD;
      simulation, use of standardized patients, and training of nurses and other health&#xD;
      professionals from Penn, Trinity Health and Jefferson. We anticipate the modules to contain&#xD;
      the following content: module 1 - introduction to COPE program, research evidence, and core&#xD;
      principles underlying the program; module 2 - overview of delivery characteristics, role of&#xD;
      RN and OT, three phases (assessment, implementation, generalizability) of the COPE program,&#xD;
      permissible adaptations; module 3 and 4-assessment phase, introduction to clinical interview&#xD;
      and all assessments and forms; module 5 and 6- implementation phase including helping&#xD;
      caregiver identify 3 problem areas, engaging in problem solving and brainstorming, developing&#xD;
      and providing an assessment report and offering prescriptions (strategies) for each&#xD;
      identified problem area; module 7 and 8 - generalizability phase or helping caregivers use&#xD;
      strategies for one problem area to address another and planning for the future; module 9-&#xD;
      developing rapport and working with family caregivers from different backgrounds, cultures,&#xD;
      living environments and relationships and helping families balance caregiving with other life&#xD;
      roles, adjusting approach by level of readiness; module 10 - challenging cases, motivational&#xD;
      interviewing, how to explain the program, how to meet caregivers where they are at and&#xD;
      provide validation and support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scripts for each module will be developed and shared with OTs/RNs who are not part of the&#xD;
      study but work within Trinity PACE programs. This will allow for continuous feedback loops to&#xD;
      assure that the scenarios meet the needs of PACE staff. We will compare the online program to&#xD;
      our traditional 3-day face-to-face training currently used with COPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3-day training program will be conducted by Dr. Piersol using a slide deck and case&#xD;
      presentations as we have previously done. The comparison of the two training programs is&#xD;
      described in Phase 2 and 3 below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 1b -The Fidelity Monitoring Program- We seek to develop a scalable approach to assess&#xD;
      fidelity to the COPE Program when it is implemented in a real-world setting such as PACE&#xD;
      using computational linguistics techniques (e.g. natural language processing). The essence of&#xD;
      fidelity to the Core Principles of COPE program will be captured by using automatic&#xD;
      classification programs that evaluate both the content that should be included in COPE&#xD;
      sessions, and the style of delivery. While automatic classification programs have been&#xD;
      applied to measure quality metrics of transcribed narratives in the field of psychotherapy&#xD;
      (21), it has not been used to measure other aspects of quality- namely fidelity to&#xD;
      evidence-based practices or dementia care and caregiver supportive programs. The development&#xD;
      of the automated Fidelity Monitoring Program will occur in three steps and will be carried&#xD;
      out by a technical team consisting of an expert in content analysis, Dr. Ani Nenkova, and a&#xD;
      consultant expert in speech recognition and prosody, Dr Mari Ostendorf. Co- I Nenkova has&#xD;
      worked extensively on automatic summarization, evaluation of automatic summarization and&#xD;
      readability and linguistic style. The ultimate goal of our efforts is to develop a system&#xD;
      that- given a recording of a COPE delivery session (e.g. in real time immediately after&#xD;
      interaction between the clinician and the caregiver)- produces a three-tiered score,&#xD;
      indicating if the fidelity was 'excellent', 'acceptable' or 'problematic'. Special emphasis&#xD;
      will be given to the accuracy of identifying 'problematic' COPE fidelity which is not fateful&#xD;
      to training and may not produce the same desired outcomes as intervention delivered with&#xD;
      higher fidelity. First, we will obtain n-best list speech recognition of the COPE interaction&#xD;
      . This will help mitigate recognition errors in the next stage. Until recently, audio&#xD;
      recording transcription was fraught with challenges particularly in sessions involving two or&#xD;
      more speakers. Advances in audio signaling and speech recognition have brought technology for&#xD;
      automating language analysis within reach. Recent research has suggested that text based&#xD;
      features may be more effective than using audio features alone when classifying fidelity in&#xD;
      behavioral research (47). Automatic speech recognition software will be used to transcribe&#xD;
      sessions and the resulting words will be used in a text-based model of fidelity. All COPE&#xD;
      training, practice and implementation sessions will be audio taped with participant consent.&#xD;
      There are several of automatic speech recognition tools that we can use. We will pick the one&#xD;
      that best balances accuracy of recognition in our domain and privacy.Once the transcripts are&#xD;
      obtained, there are two approaches that we will develop and contrast: (1) comparison with a&#xD;
      reference delivery and (2) a supervised classification approach. The first has the advantage&#xD;
      of needing only a small number of excellent deliveries and several acceptable deliveries, for&#xD;
      each of the seven dimensions, while the other needs a larger set of labeled data but would&#xD;
      potentially lead to higher accuracy of prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison or similarity to reference (Steps A and B): Our approach will leverage techniques&#xD;
      widely used in the evaluation of automatically produced content, such as machine translation&#xD;
      and automatic text summarization. In these applications it is not feasible to track system&#xD;
      improvement with human judgments of quality. Instead, most of the progress is measured by&#xD;
      computing similarity between a set of sample reference text (i.e. what a 'good' translation&#xD;
      or a 'good' summary would be) and the system output. Such automatic evaluation approaches are&#xD;
      widely used for machine translation (48) and summarization (49). While there have been some&#xD;
      concerns that the automatic measures are not fine enough to distinguish between levels of&#xD;
      very good context, these measures show strong ability to distinguish 'very bad' content&#xD;
      (50,51), (or poor fidelity) aligns with the needs of our project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Step A we will compile 10 examples of 'excellent' COPE fidelity deliveries, with the&#xD;
      regions where desired aspects is expressed will be explicitly marked, i.e. marked parts where&#xD;
      person-environment fit is discussed, or parts of the interaction where the clinician asks&#xD;
      open ended questions or confirms the caregiver understanding of the content. Next, new&#xD;
      interactions will be ranked by their similarity with the reference 'excellent' interactions&#xD;
      (52). In Step 2 we will identify 'problematic' fidelity deliveries. We will make use of 10&#xD;
      negative examples of 'acceptable' but imperfect deliveries. If the new interaction ranks&#xD;
      lower than most of these, it will be considered unacceptable or 'problematic'. Parameters and&#xD;
      decision rules will be developed at this step to determine cut-off levels for declaring an&#xD;
      interaction problematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of &quot;excellent&quot; versus &quot;problematic&quot; fidelity ratings of the audio recordings&#xD;
      will be assessed by Drs Hirshman and Renz (who were not the original developers of COPE and&#xD;
      thus they offer an independent review) using the COPE Adherence Scale developed for the&#xD;
      original clinical trial in order to evaluate the extent to which core treatment principles&#xD;
      were implemented effectively. Ratings from the Adherence Scale have been standardized such&#xD;
      that 1.00 represents perfect fidelity and 0.00 represent complete non-fidelity. The scale was&#xD;
      previously modeled off of the NIH REACH I and II fidelity approach. Findings from the&#xD;
      combined fidelity ratings will be used to refine the automated fidelity program into a &quot;best&#xD;
      model&quot; to be tested in Step C (53).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervised classification (Step C) For this approach, we will need to examine all recorded&#xD;
      sessions (600+). We will train a supervised classifier or a regression model to predict the&#xD;
      score (1 to 3, corresponding to excellent, acceptable and problematic) of a given&#xD;
      interaction. We will experiment with a number of classifiers, including deep learning&#xD;
      frameworks and more traditional support vector machine and (logistic) regression models.The&#xD;
      resulting final validation set of 100 labeled interactions will serve to finalize the best&#xD;
      model for fidelity prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 2 - Evaluation of Online Training Program in Interventionist Uptake and Fidelity Phase&#xD;
      2 of this study involves a series of activities designed to evaluate the whether an online&#xD;
      training program is the same or better in improving interventionist uptake of- and fidelity&#xD;
      to- COPE principles and protocols compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form&#xD;
      of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 3 (Aim 3) - Efficacy of COPE on PACE participant outcomes by type of COPE training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This aim will be accomplished by evaluating dyad outcomes of the COPE program under the two&#xD;
      different training approaches. Following training, each of the PACE organizations will enroll&#xD;
      5 persons with dementia and their caregivers in the study. This will yield 50 family dyads&#xD;
      (25 dyads in traditional training sites and 25 dyads in online training sites).&#xD;
