  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke and dementia are two of the most common and disabling conditions worldwide,&#xD;
      responsible for an enormous and growing burden of disease. There is increasing awareness that&#xD;
      the two conditions are linked, with cognitive impairment and dementia common after stroke,&#xD;
      vascular dementia accounting for about one-fifth of all dementia cases and recent evidence on&#xD;
      the contribution of vascular risk factors to Alzheimer's disease. Yet little is known about&#xD;
      whether brain volume loss - a hallmark of dementia - occurs after stroke, and whether such&#xD;
      atrophy is related to cognitive decline. The aim of this research is to establish whether&#xD;
      stroke patients have reductions in brain volume in the first three years post-stroke compared&#xD;
      to control subjects, and whether regional and global brain volume change is associated with&#xD;
      post-stroke dementia in order to elucidate potential causal mechanisms (including genetic&#xD;
      markers, amyloid deposition and vascular risk factors). The hypotheses are that stroke&#xD;
      patients will exhibit greater brain volume loss than comparable cohorts of stroke-free&#xD;
      controls, and further, that stroke patients who develop dementia will exhibit greater global&#xD;
      and regional brain volume loss than those who do not dement. An understanding of whether&#xD;
      stroke is neurodegenerative, and in which patients, may be used to help guide the early&#xD;
      delivery of disease-modifying therapies.&#xD;

      Our primary outcome measure was total brain volume (TBV) change between the 3-month and&#xD;
      3-year time-points compared between stroke patients and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome 1 was TBV change between 3-months and 3-years comparing CN and CI stroke&#xD;
      participants. TBV at 3-months will be adjusted for CCI scores, and years of education; the&#xD;
      latter as it is correlated with cognitive performance and post-stroke dementia risk, but not&#xD;
      for stroke lesion volume as no conclusive evidence for an effect has been demonstrated&#xD;
      previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome 2 was hippocampal volume (HV) change between 3-months and 3-years in stroke&#xD;
      patients and controls with adjustments identical to primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome 3 was the comparison of HV change between 3-months and 3-years comparing CN&#xD;
      and CI stroke participants with adjustments identical to secondary outcome 1.&#xD;
