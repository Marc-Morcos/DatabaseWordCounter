      This 7-year randomized controlled trial will compare the efficacy of non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation (trans-cranial Direct Current Stimulation - tDCS) combined with cognitive&#xD;
      remediation (CR) versus sham (&quot;placebo&quot;) tDCS combined with sham (&quot;placebo&quot;) CR in slowing&#xD;
      down cognitive decline and preventing Alzheimer's Dementia in older persons with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment or major depressive disorder with or without mild cognitive impairment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By the time Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) and related disorders (ADRD) are diagnosed the brain&#xD;
      has sustained substantial insult that limits the efficacy of current treatments. Preventive&#xD;
      interventions are urgently needed but prevention studies require large numbers of&#xD;
      participants and long follow-up periods unless they can target a high-risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to study the efficacy of a preventive intervention for AD in three&#xD;
      high risk groups: (1) older persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI); (2) older persons&#xD;
      with a major depressive disorder (MDD) without MCI; and (3) older persons with MDD and MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCI is considered a prodromal condition for dementia with a progression rate of about 1% per&#xD;
      month. MDD has independently been identified as one of the most promising targets for AD&#xD;
      prevention studies since, even after successful treatment of their depressive episode, older&#xD;
      persons with remitted MDD develop MCI or dementia at a rate of 1-2% per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators proposed intervention is a combination of cognitive remediation (CR) and&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation - transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). Participants&#xD;
      with MCI or MDD (with or without MCI) will be randomized to tDCS + CR or sham (&quot;palcebo&quot;)&#xD;
      tDCS + sham (&quot;placebo&quot;) CR. Both CR and tDCS have been shown to induce neuroplasticity and&#xD;
      improve cognition. The investigators hypothesize that their combination will enhance&#xD;
      cognitive reserve and protect against cognitive decline and the onset of MCI in those with&#xD;
      &quot;normal&quot; cognition or AD in those with MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators design is informed by their experience conducting randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) in older participants with dementia, MCI, or MDD over more than two decades. In&#xD;
      the investigators recent donepezil prevention trial, combining donepezil with standard&#xD;
      antidepressant maintenance prevented cognitive decline and the incidence of dementia in&#xD;
      participants who had had both MDD and MCI. Building on this prevention trial, the&#xD;
      investigators conceptualize the proposed study as a high-risk, high-gain RCT aimed at&#xD;
      enhancing cognitive reserve and preventing cognitive decline and dementia in a high risk&#xD;
      population. If the investigators are successful in this high risk population, then tDCS + CR&#xD;
      can be tested in, and extended to, the general population (i.e., for universal prevention) or&#xD;
      other groups at high risk for AD (i.e., for selective or indicated prevention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five Toronto academic sites with a history of successful collaboration will consent up to a&#xD;
      total of 500 participants meeting criteria for MCI (age 60 and older) or MDD (age 65 and&#xD;
      older) to reach a target of 375 enrolled participants initiating the study intervention.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either: i) tDCS + CR or ii) sham tDCS + sham CR. They will&#xD;
      first receive tDCS + CR (or sham + sham) 5 days a week for 8 weeks, followed by home-based CR&#xD;
      (or sham) and booster sessions of tDCS + CR (or sham + sham) for 5 days every 6 months until&#xD;
      they develop dementia (or MCI for those who are deemed cognitively intact at baseline) or&#xD;
      complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, the study has been modified to be administered in a hybrid&#xD;
      manner to accommodate both in-person and virtual assessments. Clinical and cognitive&#xD;
      assessments (every 12 months) can be done in person or remotely (via telephone or using&#xD;
      WebEx/Zoom). Some assessments are modified to accommodate the change in format of&#xD;
      administration while maintaining the validity and integrity of the data. The assessments that&#xD;
      cannot be done via phone or videoconference will temporarily not be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, the intervention booster group sessions (every 6 months) can also be provided in&#xD;
      two formats of in-person or virtual (via WebEx or Zoom) sessions. The tDCS administration&#xD;
      cannot be done remotely and hence the virtual booster sessions will only consist of the CR&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
