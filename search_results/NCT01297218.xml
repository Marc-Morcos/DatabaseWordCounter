      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of&#xD;
      NEUROSTEM®-AD (Human Umbilical Cord Blood Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells) and to assess the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD). This study is also to investigate the efficacy of this study&#xD;
      drug in patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most of the treatments for Alzheimer disease are chemical drug that is designed to&#xD;
      temporarily increase acetylcholine, based on the cholinergic hypothesis. These drugs can&#xD;
      improve the symptoms but is not able to inhibit the disease progression. New drugs from the&#xD;
      disease have been developed but they have not been successful yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are capable of differentiating into various tissues. Due to the&#xD;
      characteristics of the cells it has been widely investigated in tissue regeneration. In&#xD;
      addition, the paracrine effect of MSC in microenvironment has been recently reported. MSC has&#xD;
      been developed as an immunomodulation cell therapy product because it has been known that it&#xD;
      does not cause immunological rejection in allo- and xeno-transplantation. Clinical studies&#xD;
      showed that umbilical cord blood-derived MSC is immunologically stable and not toxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of NEUROSTEM®-AD (Human Umbilical&#xD;
      Cord Blood Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells) and to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
      This study is also to investigate the efficacy of this study drug in patients with dementia&#xD;
      of Alzheimer's type.&#xD;
