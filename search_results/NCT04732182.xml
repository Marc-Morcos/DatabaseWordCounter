  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot RCT with equal arms: experimental arm and (wait list) control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease and on stable medication.&#xD;
      They will all continue with this medication for their 6 months participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group will add weekly training on the experimental device, 5 days a week for 8&#xD;
      weeks. Training will involve therapeutic games aimed primarily at the memory cognitive&#xD;
      domain. All participants will receive weekly calls from clinical coordinator and report on&#xD;
      medication and overall health. Caregivers will also be enrolled so they support the trials.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized equally into an experimental group and a wait list control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental training will occur in the home, and will last 8 weeks, each week having 5&#xD;
      sessions of therapeutic game play. Each session will start with vitals being measured and&#xD;
      logged followed by motor and biosensor baselines. Subsequently, participants will play an&#xD;
      increasing number of games, targeted at the major cognitive domains of memory (primarily),&#xD;
      attention and executive functions. Since sessions will increase in length, researchers expect&#xD;
      that more than 10 short games may eventually be played in each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an ABAA protocol for the experimental group, and a AABA protocol for the&#xD;
      wait-list control group. Data will be sampled at baseline (A), during each rehabilitation&#xD;
      session (B), mid-way through the study (at 2 months from baseline) and at the end of the&#xD;
      study, at 4 months from baseline (A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of every 4 weeks of BrightGo training, the participant and caregiver will each&#xD;
      fill a custom subjective evaluation questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before crossover to the experimental protocol, participants in the wait-list group will&#xD;
      continue with their daily routine and prescribed medication (which will be logged). After&#xD;
      crossing over, they will add the BrightGo intervention to their daily routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants initially randomized to the experimental group will continue with daily routine&#xD;
      and medication, and add the 5 sessions per week of experimental therapy. Once they cross over&#xD;
      to the control arm after 8 weeks from start, they will continue with their daily routine and&#xD;
      prescribed medication (which will again be logged) for another 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a weekly call from the Clinical Coordinator so to report on any&#xD;
      health concerns and system issues, as well as medication use. Caregivers will also be&#xD;
      enrolled so they support the trials.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in visual attention as measured by Neuropsychological Assessment Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, at 8 weeks from baseline (2 months),and at 16 weeks from baseline (4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Visual attention measured with the dots test of the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB). This is a delayed recognition span paradigm, in which an array of dots is exposed for a brief period, followed by a blank interference page, followed by a new array with one additional dot. The subject needs to point to the &quot;new&quot; dot. Test administered 3 times, minimum score 0 (none of the new dots found) to maximum 3 (all 3 new dots found). [Hartman 2006]</description>

    <measure>Change in verbal memory as measured by Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Revised (HVLT-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, at 8 weeks from baseline (2 months),and at 16 weeks from baseline (4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Revised (HVLT-R) is a measure of verbal memory. It provides a brief assessment of immediate recall, delayed recall and delayed recognition. Subject is read a series of nouns in several categories, and the asked t repeat these nouns by writing them on a piece of paper. The test is repeated three times, and each time the score is a count of how many nouns were remembered by the subject. The second phase of the test involves delayed recall, which is administered after about 20 minutes from the original test. subject needs to write down all the nouns they remembered and these are counted. There is a maximum of 12 correct responses during delayed recall, so max score is 12 [Brandt 1991]</description>

    <measure>Change in visuospatial memory as measured by Brief Visuospatial MemoryTest, Revised (BVMT-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, at 8 weeks from baseline (2 months),and at 16 weeks from baseline (4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>BVMT-R is a measure of visuospatial memory. In three Learning Trials, the subject views a stimulus page showing an geometric figure for 10 seconds, and there are 6 drawings presented. Then the subject is asked to draw as many of the figures as possible in their correct location on a page in the response booklet. A Delayed Recall Trial is administered after a 25-minute delay. Last, a Recognition Trial, in which the respondent is asked to identify which of 12 figures were included among the original geometric figures, is administered. Raw scores will be used, with higher numbers representing better outcomes [Benedict et al., 1996].</description>
