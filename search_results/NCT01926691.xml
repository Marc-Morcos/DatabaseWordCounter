  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that even mild stroke survivors experience&#xD;
      residual damage, which persists and in fact increases in subsequent years. About 45% of&#xD;
      stroke victims remain with different levels of disability. While studies on cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and dementia after stroke are receiving increasing clinical attention, the&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood. Identifying the mechanisms involved and&#xD;
      recognizing early biomarkers for individual vulnerability, require a multi-modal approach, as&#xD;
      the mechanisms involved in cerebrovascular disease and individual trajectories of post-stroke&#xD;
      recovery may impact upon each other on various levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Hypothesis: To date there is no single measure that can be used to identify patients&#xD;
      who are prone to develop cognitive impairment and other disabilities from those with better&#xD;
      recovery prospects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that data based on biochemical, neuroimaging, genetic and psychological&#xD;
      measures can, in aggregate, serve as better predictors for subsequent disability, cognitive&#xD;
      and neurological deterioration, and suggest possible interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The TABASCO (Tel-Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort) study, a prospective cohort study&#xD;
      aim to recruit about approximately 1125 consecutive first-ever mild-moderate stroke patients.&#xD;
      It is designed to evaluate the association between predefined demographic, psychological,&#xD;
      inflammatory, biochemical, neuro-imaging and genetic markers, measured during the acute&#xD;
      phase, and long-term outcome: subsequent cognitive deterioration, vascular events (including&#xD;
      recurrent strokes), falls, affective changes, functional everyday difficulties and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This study is an attempt to comprehensively investigate the long term outcome of&#xD;
      mild-moderate strokes. Its prospective design will provide quantitative data on stroke&#xD;
      recurrence, the incidence of other vascular events and the evaluation of cognitive, affective&#xD;
      and functional decline. Identifying the factors associated with post stroke cognitive and&#xD;
      functional decline could potentially yield more effective therapeutic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that an extensive approach of analyzing the interaction between&#xD;
      different risk factors would more accurately predict neurological and cognitive&#xD;
      deterioration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the TABASCO study is to identify predictors of post stroke cognitive&#xD;
      decline. A particular focus will be on inflammatory and stress markers, as well as&#xD;
      neuroimaging measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are recruited from patients admitted to the Department of Emergency Medicine at&#xD;
      the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (TASMC) within 72 hours of their first-ever acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) symptoms onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age ≥ 50 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Israeli residents&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Acute stroke/TIA that occurred within the last 3 days as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
           acute focal neurological deficit with a total score on the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) &lt;17&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Written informed consent by patient prior to study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Willingness to participate in follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      patients presenting with a primary hemorrhagic stroke (intracerebral or subarachnoid)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. history of any preceding cerebral vascular event (excluding previous TIA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. imminent death or unconscious state&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. patients unlikely to be released from hospital following the qualifying stroke, or have&#xD;
           a severe disability after the qualifying stroke which makes follow-up unlikely&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. known malignant disease or other chronic disease with poor prognosis (predicted survival&#xD;
           less than two-years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. stroke resulting from trauma or invasive procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. patients with a prestroke history consistent with dementia or cognitive impairment&#xD;
           before the stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. severe aphasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke diagnosis is verified by senior vascular neurologists and baseline demographic and&#xD;
      clinical data are collected. Interviews are conducted by trained interviewers at baseline, 3,&#xD;
      6, 12 and 24 months, and yearly thereafter up to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments and data collection A senior vascular neurologist conducts a thorough physical&#xD;
      examination and reviews the imaging data and medical records of potential participants to&#xD;
      determine eligibility. Participants are asked to consent for all study examinations and a&#xD;
      signed informed consent is obtained from patients who agree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information is collected for the evaluation of co-morbidities at the time of recruitment and&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects are prospectively followed at three-, six-, 12 and 24 months from stroke onset&#xD;
      and annually thereafter. Approximately three-months after stroke, consenting participants are&#xD;
      visited at home by trained occupational therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects who died, the date of death is recorded along with its cause, based on&#xD;
      information obtained from the family, medical records, death certificates and data from the&#xD;
      government's official civil registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size In an attempt to identify a 40% difference in post stroke cognitive decline, we&#xD;
      have calculated the required sample size (Ben Assayag E et al,International Journal of&#xD;
      Stroke,Vol 7, June 2012, 341-347).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit at least 1125 participants to allow for loss to follow-up,&#xD;
      potential clustering effects, missing data and to provide sufficient numbers for multivariate&#xD;
      modeling.&#xD;
