      In this study in-vivo quantification of amyloid load will be performed in patients with AD,&#xD;
      MCI and normal controls with Positron Emission Tomography. For this the PET tracers [11C]PIB&#xD;
      and [18F]FDDNP will be compared.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive&#xD;
      impairment in daily life, cognitive deterioration, and a variety of neuropsychiatric and&#xD;
      behavioural symptoms. The diagnosis of AD is based on clinical criteria, but these have low&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity for AD in the early stages of the disease. Therefore, there is a&#xD;
      great need for a method to identify the pathological process of AD at an earlier, preclinical&#xD;
      stage. In-vivo imaging and quantification of pathological beta-amyloid (Aß) accumulation may&#xD;
      provide such a method as the production and accumulation of Aß is thought to be central to&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of AD. The view is widely held that Aß may be present in the brain at&#xD;
      sublethal concentrations for extended periods before the overt manifestation of AD.&#xD;
      Therefore, early, in-vivo detection of pathological Aß accumulation is warranted and may&#xD;
      identify subjects at risk for AD. Neuroimaging with Positron Emission Tomography (PET)&#xD;
      permits in-vivo imaging and quantification of cerebral amyloid load, which is a novel&#xD;
      application of PET. Recently, several PET tracers ([18F]FDDNP and [11C]PIB) have been&#xD;
      developed for this purpose and the first clinical studies in patients with AD are&#xD;
      encouraging. For both tracers, many methodological issues still need to be resolved and the&#xD;
      clinical value of in-vivo amyloid imaging remains to be established. The most important&#xD;
      objectives of this project are twofold: to provide an independent and unbiased evaluation of&#xD;
      the value of in-vivo amyloid imaging in the (early) diagnosis of AD and to optimize methods&#xD;
      for quantification of the in-vivo cerebral amyloid load. To investigate the value in the&#xD;
      early diagnosis, identification of subjects at risk for AD is essential. Patients with&#xD;
      amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), i.e patients suffering only from memory problems&#xD;
      but without the other symptoms of AD, are recruited for this purpose. MCI is a disease state&#xD;
      considered to be a transitional state between normal aging and dementia. It is generally&#xD;
      accepted that the ability to identify the presence of Alzheimer type pathology in the MCI&#xD;
      stage will benefit disease management. Twenty patients with amnestic MCI, 15 patients with AD&#xD;
      and 15 age and sex matched healthy controls will be included in this study. Only consecutive&#xD;
      new patients fulfilling criteria of amnestic MCI will be included. Patients with MCI will&#xD;
      remain under clinical observation during two years after participation in order to monitor&#xD;
      conversion to clinical dementia. All subjects will receive [11C]PIB and [18F]FDDNP PET scans&#xD;
      on a single day. In addition, patients will receive a [18F]FDG PET scan. Furthermore, an MRI&#xD;
      scan, a neuropsychological evaluation and CSF analysis for diagnostic purposes will be&#xD;
      performed in all subjects.&#xD;
