      Our preliminary data show for in cognitively-normal elderly, that Sleep Disordered Breathing&#xD;
      (SDB) is associated with the increase of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated-Tau (P-Tau)&#xD;
      and total-Tau (T-Tau), decreases in medial temporal lobe glucose uptake (FDG-PET) and volume&#xD;
      (MRI) and progressive memory decline, all of which have been shown to be useful in predicting&#xD;
      future dementia in older adults. These findings raise the question as to whether Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD) tissue damage causes SDB in the elderly, or alternatively, if SDB acts as a risk&#xD;
      factor for AD neurodegeneration. In the proposed study, we will investigate these mechanistic&#xD;
      hypotheses in cognitively normal elderly by examining the longitudinal associations between&#xD;
      SDB and cognitive decline, novel MR neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers for neurodegeneration;&#xD;
      while our secondary goal is to launch a pilot treatment study to aid in interpreting the&#xD;
      mechanistic hypotheses and to examine the effects of nasal continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (CPAP) on cognitive decline and neurodegeneration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common disorder with an estimated prevalence in the&#xD;
      elderly ranging from 30-80%. The relevance of this high frequency in late life is emerging,&#xD;
      as recent evidence suggests that SDB may be associated with the development of mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and&#xD;
      affects nearly 45% of the population older than 85. Hippocampal atrophy and glucose&#xD;
      hypometabolism, as well as changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid beta-42&#xD;
      (Aβ42), phosphorylated-tau (P-Tau) and total-tau (T-Tau), have been shown to be useful in&#xD;
      predicting future decline in cognitively normal older adults, which suggests that AD&#xD;
      pathology is detectable prior to cognitive impairment in at-risk subjects. This&#xD;
      &quot;presymptomatic phase&quot;, in which tissue damage is minimal and whose detection precedes&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, is an ideal stage for risk factor analysis and intervention trials. Our&#xD;
      preliminary data show, for the first time in cognitively-normal elderly, that the severity of&#xD;
      SDB (as measured by respiratory events with 4% desaturation, Apnea Hypopnea Index 4% [AHI4%])&#xD;
      is associated with the increase of CSF P-Tau and T-Tau, a decrease in glucose uptake&#xD;
      (measured by FDG-PET) in the medial temporal lobe, reduced hippocampal volume, and&#xD;
      longitudinal memory decline. These findings raise the question as to whether AD tissue damage&#xD;
      causes SDB in the elderly, or alternatively, if SDB acts as a risk factor for&#xD;
      neurodegeneration. The proposed parent grant for this project conducted at the NYU Center for&#xD;
      Brain Health (CBH), is a 5-year NIH-funded longitudinal study of 180 normal elderly (50-95&#xD;
      years), who will undergo complete baseline and 24 month follow-up evaluations. The exams&#xD;
      include MR imaging: both structural and cerebral blood flow (CBF) using a novel NYU arterial&#xD;
      spin labeling (ASL) protocol and regional brain vasoreactivity estimates after CO2 breathing&#xD;
      (VR-CO2); as well as both plasma and CSF biomarkers. The present ancillary proposal,&#xD;
      performed in collaboration with NYU's Sleep Disorders Center, will investigate: 1) SDB as a&#xD;
      longitudinal predictor of changes in memory, levels of P-tau and T-Tau, hippocampal atrophy,&#xD;
      and the blunted VR-CO2 response (all these effects of SDB were observed in cross-section in&#xD;
      our pilot work); and 2) if these SDB related phenomena in normal elderly are susceptible to&#xD;
      intervention with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in moderate-to-severe SDB&#xD;
      subjects. This study has the potential to identify: 1) a highly prevalent AD-related&#xD;
      mechanism by which SDB contributes to cognitive decline; 2) the alternative hypothesis, the&#xD;
      presence of biomarker features of AD as risks factors for SDB; and 3) that the treatment of&#xD;
      SDB with CPAP improves cognition through an AD-related pathway in the elderly.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects with normal cognition and &gt;50 years of age will be enrolled.&#xD;
             Younger subjects are not included as the risk for cognitive impairment is too low.&#xD;
             Moreover, by selecting this age-range we minimize the possibility of including&#xD;
             early-onset genetic forms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
             and Frontotemporal Dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal subjects will be within normal limits on neurological and psychiatric&#xD;
             examinations. All subjects enrolled will have both a Clinical Dementia Rating = 0 and&#xD;
             Global Deterioration Scale &lt; 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will have had a minimum of 12 years education.The education restriction&#xD;
             reduces performance variance on cognitive test measures and improves the sensitivity&#xD;
             for detecting pathology and disease progression using the robust norms available at&#xD;
             NYU School of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will have an informed family member or life partner interviewed to&#xD;
             confirm the reliability of the subject interview. All subjects will agree to the MRI&#xD;
             imaging, the lumbar puncture, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping and DNA banking&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of any brain disease or MRI evidence of brain damage including significant&#xD;
             trauma, hydrocephalus, seizures, mental retardation or other serious neurological&#xD;
             disorder (e.g. Parkinson's disease or other movement disorders). Persons with silent&#xD;
             cortical infarcts are excluded. Subcortical infarcts and white matter lesions are not&#xD;
             exclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;

             of major depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hamilton Depression Scale &gt;16 only with history of life long depressive episodes.&#xD;
             Otherwise not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of clinically relevant and uncontrolled cardiac, pulmonary, or hypothyroid or&#xD;
             hematological conditions. Insulin dependent diabetes and/or history or treated&#xD;
             hypertension are not an exclusion. Normal subjects with current levels of HbA1c &gt;5.9%&#xD;
             or diabetics &gt;7.0% (American Diabetes Association, 2010) and/or current blood pressure&#xD;
             levels &gt;140/90 mm Hg (JNC on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High&#xD;
             Blood Pressure, 2003) will be advised to seek referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical impairment of such severity as to adversely affect the validity of&#xD;

             for MRI imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a first-degree family member with early onset (before age 65) dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medications adversely affecting cognition will result in exclusion. The excluded&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  At the baseline individuals taking physician ordered or off-label memory or other&#xD;
             cognitive enhancing medications (e.g. cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine) are&#xD;
             excluded. At the follow-up these medications are allowed. Also excluded at baseline&#xD;
             are individuals taking physician ordered, but off-label memory enhancements.&#xD;
             Individuals taking over the counter memory enhancing or protecting medications (e.g.&#xD;
             ginkgo biloba, vitamins) are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant physical changes (e.g. amputations or loss of sensory input)&#xD;
             as these may affect the MRI blood flow measures.&#xD;
