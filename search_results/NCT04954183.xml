  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to collect and compare electroencephalogram data from all&#xD;
      stages of Alzheimer's disease from preclinical through severe dementia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diagnoses of sporadic and late onset Alzheimer's disease dementia, MCI, and DLB&#xD;
      evaluated by a dementia subspecialist will meet published diagnostic criteria, and EEGs will&#xD;
      be obtained through written informed consent. Regarding presymptomatic patients, we have&#xD;
      previously shown that the mean age of MCI diagnosis in our cohort is 73 years and that&#xD;
      preclinical cognitive decline begins as much as 20 years before clinical diagnosis but is&#xD;
      also affected by APOE genotype. Eligibility therefore will include unimpaired APOE e4/4&#xD;
      homozygotes age 65-75 and APOE e3/4 heterozygotes age 75-85 for the preclinical AD subset and&#xD;
      age, sex, and education matched APOE e4 noncarriers for the unaffected controls. Biomarker&#xD;
      confirmation for preclinical diagnosis will be utilized to the extent possible (a subset of&#xD;
      130 members of our cohort have undergone amyloid-PET resulting in approximately 45 who are&#xD;
      amyloid positive). EEG data will be performed during wakefulness with 15 minutes of eyes open&#xD;
      and 15 minutes of eyes closed. A 32 electrode cap will be applied following the 10-20&#xD;
      anatomical system by certified EEG technologists. Data will be recorded using a&#xD;
      research-grade EEG system with FDA 510(k) clearance for use in medical contexts. Subjects&#xD;
      will be seated in a testing room with minimal distractions. An EEG tech will fit the subject&#xD;
      with a cap containing NN Ag/AgCl electrodes placed according to the international 10-10&#xD;
      system and ensure electrode impedances stay below 10 kâ„¦. Subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
      minimize movements and remain in a relaxed but wakeful state. We will record fifteen minutes&#xD;
      of eyes-open resting state EEG. Afterwards, the subjects will be instructed to close their&#xD;
      eyes and reminded to stay relaxed but awake, and we will record fifteen minutes of&#xD;
      eyes-closed resting state EEG. During the recording session, a researcher will monitor the&#xD;
      subject's behavior and the EEG signal. The researcher will briefly prompt the subject to&#xD;
      remain awake if the subject's behavior or EEG traces show signs of drowsiness. All data will&#xD;
      be de-identified then transferred to SPARK Neuro's research and development team for analysis&#xD;
      via secure encrypted methods. The data will be stored on password-protected computer systems,&#xD;
      and only the necessary research and research-support staff at SPARK Neuro will have access to&#xD;
      the data. The SPARK Neuro research and development team will analyze de-identified patient&#xD;
      data to address the aims of this proposal. SPARK Neuro will use various techniques including&#xD;
      those standard in EEG analysis (e.g. filtering, scaling, independent components analysis),&#xD;
      particular approaches shown to be successful in the Alzheimer's disease EEG classification&#xD;
      literature (e.g. coherence, relative power in standard frequency bands, functional&#xD;
      connectivity, spectral entropy), as well as approaches from the broader machine-learning and&#xD;
      EEG literature (e.g. spectral clustering, convolutional neural networks, cross-frequency&#xD;
      coupling, non-linear kernels, Katz fractal dimension, beamforming).&#xD;

        presymptomatic APOE e4 carriers, and age, sex, and education matched APOE e4 noncarriers&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  5 individuals with moderate to severe dementia, 5 with mild stage dementia, 5 with&#xD;
             amnestic MCI, 5 presymptomatic APOE e4 carriers, and 5 age, sex, and education matched&#xD;
             APOE e4 noncarriers. Additionally we will include a group of 5 patients with mild to&#xD;
             moderate stage dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the second most common degenerative&#xD;
             dementia, to explore differences from clinically typical Alzheimer's disease patients&#xD;
             given the known clinical differences in EEG dysrhythmic severity between them (total&#xD;
             of 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unimpaired APOE e4/4 homozygotes age 65-75 and APOE e3/4 heterozygotes age 75-85 for&#xD;
             the preclinical AD subset and age, sex, and education matched APOE e4 noncarriers for&#xD;
             the unaffected controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biomarker confirmation for preclinical diagnosis will be utilized to the extent&#xD;
             possible (a subset of 130 members of our cohort have undergone amyloid-PET resulting&#xD;
             in approximately 45 who are amyloid positive).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe head injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Craniotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other potentially confounding neurologic illness (typically anything that causes&#xD;
             structural brain damage).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychoactive medication use will not be an absolute exclusionary criterion in patients&#xD;
             with moderate to severe dementia but patients who are relatively drug-free will be&#xD;
             prioritized to the extent they are available within the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychoactive drug use will be exclusionary in the prospectively obtained clinical&#xD;
             patients.&#xD;
