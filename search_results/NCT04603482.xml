      How do varying levels of participation in selecting self-management interventions (ranging&#xD;
      from no input into the selection to selection based on need or preference) affect health&#xD;
      risks and physical and mental health over time in family caregivers of persons with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's and other dementia disorders? Caregivers will be randomized to 1) information on&#xD;
      diversional activities (attention control); 2) self-management intervention based on need&#xD;
      (SM-need); or 3) self-management intervention of their preference (SM-preference).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has two aims: The primary aim (A1) is to examine differences across the three&#xD;
      groups (attention control, SM-need, and SM-preference) on caregiver health (health risks and&#xD;
      mental and physical health) over time. The investigators hypothesize that the caregivers who&#xD;
      receive a self-management intervention based on need (SM-need) or preference (SM-preference)&#xD;
      will have better health outcomes than those in the attention control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to: A2) explore whether caregiver baseline need or preference for&#xD;
      intervention (i.e. choice) is associated with: a) care recipient's symptoms; b) caregiver&#xD;
      reactions; and c) caregiving involvement, and A3) build caregiver profiles from demographic/&#xD;
      contextual factors that are associated with their needs and preferences for the&#xD;
      self-management interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All caregivers will complete assessment measures and measures of health risks, and physical&#xD;
      and mental health at baseline (T1), about 6 months (T2), and about 12 months (T3). Caregivers&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. The attention control group will receive&#xD;
      information on diversional activities. The SM-need group will receive a self-management&#xD;
      intervention for biofeedback training or resourcefulness training, as determined by baseline&#xD;
      cut scores. Caregivers in the SM-preference group will choose one of the two self-management&#xD;
      interventions according to their personal preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both self-management interventions (biofeedback training, resourcefulness training) and the&#xD;
      diversional activities, are delivered over four weeks (between T1 and T2). Caregivers may use&#xD;
      the intervention whenever and as often as they wish (i.e. self-tailoring) for the remainder&#xD;
      of the study period. These resourcefulness training includes teaching self-help&#xD;
      (stress-management, problem-solving) and help-seeking skills, respectively. Biofeedback&#xD;
      training consists of the use of a hand-held device that shows the participant their changes&#xD;
      in heart rate based on changes in their breathing pattern (as they relax); caregivers who&#xD;
      need or prefer the biofeedback will be given a device to use for 28 days. All study&#xD;
      participants receiving the intervention will also be asked to keep a journal to record their&#xD;
      experience with the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Changes in the heart rate variability (HRV), as measured through non-invasive heart rate monitoring and scored in standard deviations of milliseconds of fluctuation from average heart rate. While range norms are specific to age and cardiovascular function, higher scores indicate lower levels of stress, and greater adaptability and resilience of the autonomic nervous system in response to stress.</description>
