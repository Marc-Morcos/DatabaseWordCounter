             prostate cancer with a normal prostate-specific antigen posttreatment within the last&#xD;
             five years.&#xD;

             diagnosis other than AD if, in the judgment of the Investigator, the psychiatric&#xD;
             disorder or symptom is likely to confound interpretation of drug effect, affect&#xD;
             cognitive assessments, or affect the participant´s ability to complete the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Significant risk of suicide, as judged by the site Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. History of multiple concussions, significant head trauma, or objective change in&#xD;
             neuropsychological function within the last five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. History of alcohol or drug abuse/dependence within the last five years.&#xD;
