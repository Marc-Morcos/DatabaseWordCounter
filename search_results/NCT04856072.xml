    <textblock>
      Background/Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite years of recognition and attempts at treatment, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remains a&#xD;
      pervasive and challenging condition, with an inexorable progression to severe disability and&#xD;
      death once a diagnosis is made. The latest attempts at pharmacologic have yielded, at best,&#xD;
      very modest results. There exists, therefore, no treatment for AD that significantly slows&#xD;
      down its progression, and alters the metabolic milieu of AD brains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have conducted and published the world's first phase I safety and feasibility trial of&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation (DBS) for early Alzheimer's Disease and the first Phase II randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study of DBS in the same population. These trials have had the following&#xD;
      three objectives: 1) establishing the safety of DBS in AD, 2) studying the possible slowing&#xD;
      of cognitive decline in AD, and 3) studying the relationship between focal brain stimulation&#xD;
      and metabolic changes in regions known to be affected by AD neurodegeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this background, we now want to continue and expand our DBS for AD trials. The rationale&#xD;
      of the currently proposed study is to optimize patient selection and stimulation parameter&#xD;
      dose for DBS for AD. We will measure the effects of DBS on brain amyloid load, on&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer protein metabolites and will screen various stimulation&#xD;
      parameter settings for their acute effects on memory function. The latter will be used in an&#xD;
      attempt to define the optimal stimulation dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance of this study is two-fold: 1) A possible demonstration that DBS may directly&#xD;
      influence brain pathology in AD as measured by amyloid imaging and CSF protein changes, hence&#xD;
      providing a mechanism of action for its clinical effects, and 2) the first study to&#xD;
      empirically determine, using a memory task, the optimal stimulation parameters for DBS&#xD;
      patients to improve memory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Influence of DBS on AD Pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
           Early results suggest that DBS may influence cognitive and memory functions in patients&#xD;
           with early Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It is not clear, however, whether DBS can directly&#xD;
           influence pathology in AD, such as CSF protein biomarkers and amyloid plaque load in the&#xD;
           brain. The objective of this study is to analyze CSF and brain plaque load prior to and&#xD;
           after surgery to determine whether DBS influences central nervous systems pathology&#xD;
           associated with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose Optimization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, selecting the optimal stimulation dose for patients with non-motor conditions&#xD;
      (i.e. Alzheimer's Disease, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder) is performed largely&#xD;
      arbitrarily, and borrows heavily from settings used in motor conditions (i.e. Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease, Tremor). The objective of this study is to establish a clinically meaningful dose&#xD;
      optimization test that will use the patients' performance on an experimental memory task to&#xD;
      determine the optimal stimulation settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study has the following exploratory hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. DBS may lead to changes in CSF biomarkers of AD pathology, including tau, phosphorylated&#xD;
      tau, and beta amyloid, consistent with plaque clearance ii. DBS may lead to reductions in&#xD;
      plaque burden, demonstrated by amyloid PET imaging iii. The optimal dose of brain&#xD;
      stimulation, which maximizes benefits and minimizes adverse events, can be selected using an&#xD;
      acute memory task performed in the post-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, prospective trial designed to measure the influence of DBS on AD brain&#xD;
      pathology and to optimize stimulation parameter selection post-operatively. Twelve (12)&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled and operated, and followed in an open-label fashion. All subjects&#xD;
      will be followed to a common closing date, which will be at the time the last subject&#xD;
      enrolled is followed for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection and enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-treatment procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           The schedule for individual subjects is outlined below in table format and is displayed&#xD;
           in Figure 1 as a flowchart. This study is divided into four phases: screening, baseline,&#xD;
           surgery, and on-stimulation. All patients will be recruited through the memory clinic at&#xD;
           Toronto Western Hospital and local advertisements. Patients meeting inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria will be approached for participation. There will be two distinct periods of&#xD;
           informed consent in this study: the first, to allow study investigators to screen&#xD;
           patients for study inclusion, and the second, to formally enroll patients into the&#xD;
           study. Figure 1 outlines the process that will take place for identified patients and&#xD;
           the estimated number of individual subjects at each stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once patients are identified by the study neurologist, screening consent will be&#xD;
           obtained. This consent will signal entrance into the first phase of the study, and&#xD;
           indicates that the patient meets inclusion/exclusion criteria. During the screening&#xD;
           visit, patients will undergo a medical history and general physical examination,&#xD;
           medication screening, electrocardiogram, relevant pre-operative blood work,&#xD;
           neuropsychological testing and psychiatric screening: the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment&#xD;
           Scale-Cognitive Subscale(ADAS-Cog) Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale,&#xD;
           Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS),&#xD;
           Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), which&#xD;
           will be used to classify participants by inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the&#xD;
           screening is complete, patients will be discussed by the study team to determine whether&#xD;
           they should continue in the trial, and progress to the baseline stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The baseline stage will require an additional informed consent, as this stage signals&#xD;
           entry into the formal trial. Baseline investigations will commence within 2 months of&#xD;
           signing baseline consent, and can take place up to within 1 day of surgery&#xD;
           (&quot;implantation&quot;). Baseline investigations will include all tests and examinations done&#xD;
           during Screening (excepting the ECG), with the addition of: the Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
           Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory 23-item Scale (ADCS-ADL23), the&#xD;
           Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), neuroimaging (MRI and Amyloid PET) as well as a&#xD;
           lumbar puncture (LP) for AD protein markers. Participants will also complete acute&#xD;
           experimental memory tasks that will be used in the 'dosing' phase, to familiarize them&#xD;
           with the procedure. For these memory tasks, patients will view stimuli (e.g., objects,&#xD;
           faces, scenes, words), and then be asked to remember them. In addition, an experimental&#xD;
           visual associative recognition task, which is a simplified version of the one that was&#xD;
           critical in identifying memory-specific effects in the sentinel case (Hamani et al&#xD;
           2008), will be introduced at this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once all baseline investigations are complete, patients will be scheduled for surgery&#xD;
           and implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment procedures - DBS surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
           DBS surgery will be performed as is done routinely and has been performed on the&#xD;
           previous 18 patients with AD at our centre. Patients will arrive on the morning of&#xD;
           surgery at the Toronto Western Hospital medical imaging department. They will have a&#xD;
           small part of their head shaved and then have a stereotactic frame attached directly to&#xD;
           their skull, after infiltration with local anaesthesia. The frame allows precise&#xD;
           co-ordinates to be acquired so that deep brain structures can be targeted with implanted&#xD;
           electrodes. The patient will then undergo an MRI scan (for surgical planning) with the&#xD;
           frame in place, followed by transport directly to the operating room. The anaesthesia&#xD;
           team will insert an intravenous line followed by induction and initiation of general&#xD;
           anaesthesia (GA). The entire case, including electrode implantation and implantation of&#xD;
           the pulse generator, will be done under general anaesthesia with the patient fully&#xD;
           asleep. In the operating room the patient's head, via the frame, will be attached to the&#xD;
           operating room table, and their scalp infiltrated with additional local anaesthetic. A&#xD;
           skin incision will be made and two 2.5 mm diameter burr holes drilled through the skull.&#xD;
           A DBS electrode will be delivered at the fornix target as identified on the MRI scan&#xD;
           obtained earlier in the morning. The patient will be monitored throughout the entire&#xD;
           case. Once implanted, the second stage of the operation with begin (about 30 min)&#xD;
           whereby the electrodes are connected to a battery placed under the right collarbone.&#xD;
           With the patient asleep, the electrodes are tunneled to the battery, and connected. Both&#xD;
           the head and chest incisions are then closed and the patient transferred to the recovery&#xD;
           room. Following surgery, the patient will be transferred to the neurosurgical ward for&#xD;
           recovery. On the first post-op day, they will undergo an MRI of their brain to confirm&#xD;
           the electrode location. Should the electrodes be in a suboptimal location (e.g. nearby&#xD;
           but not within the target), patients will be offered several options: re-operation for&#xD;
           lead repositioning, leave the system in place and turn device on, leave the system in&#xD;
           place and keep device off, or removal of the system completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recovery following surgery should take 1-2 days, and patients will be discharged home on&#xD;
           post-op day 2, with the stimulator in the off position. Patients will return to the&#xD;
           neurosurgical clinic two weeks after discharge to check the wound, remove staples, and&#xD;
           for routine post-op follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Other Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beta-Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans. Beta-Amyloid PET scans will be used to&#xD;
      estimate amyloid burden in the brains of the patients and to probe whether DBS has an impact&#xD;
      on this process. Flutemetamol (GE Healthcare) is an FDA-approved amyloid PET radiotracer that&#xD;
      has been approved by Health Canada for research use. PET scans will be performed on a Siemens&#xD;
      HRRT scanner. During radiotracer uptake, patients will be maintained in a quiet, dimly lit&#xD;
      room, with eyes open and ears unoccluded. Ninety minutes after a 5mCi ± 10% radiotracer&#xD;
      injection, patients will be positioned in the scanner, and a 20-minute emission scan will be&#xD;
      obtained, followed by a transmission scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar Puncture (LP) for protein analysis. The procedure is done with patients lying on their&#xD;
      side. The skin is washed with sterilizing solution; 3 ml of local anesthetic is injected in&#xD;
      the skin and subcutaneous tissue at the lumbar 4/5 level. 6 ml of CSF is removed and&#xD;
      distributed in aliquots. The samples are immediately frozen and stored at -80C. CSF levels of&#xD;
      Tau, phosphoTau and beta amyloid are determined by standard protein analysis. The analysis&#xD;
      will be performed as per the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation dose finding studies. At the patient visits, the DBS will be programmed to test&#xD;
      the effects of various stimulus settings on memory performance. Testing sessions will last up&#xD;
      to 2.5 hours or less if, the patient becomes tired. Settings will be adjusted to ensure that&#xD;
      the patients do not feel or experience adverse effects. Heart rate will be monitored during&#xD;
      programming. Patients will be asked to perform a memory task at each of the tested settings&#xD;
      to determine optimal setting during subsequent visits. This setting will remain stable until&#xD;
      the next visit, at which time settings will again be evaluated and may be changed. For the&#xD;
      memory tasks, patients will view stimuli (e.g., objects, faces, scenes, words), and will then&#xD;
      be asked to remember the stimuli. Each test will last approximately 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
