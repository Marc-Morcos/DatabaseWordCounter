      Non-randomized natural history study involving 12 subjects with Down Syndrome, who are aged&#xD;
      30-60 years old. This study will observe 3 different groups: four non-demented subjects&#xD;
      between ages 30-40 years old, four non-demented subjects between ages 40-50 years old, and&#xD;
      four demented subjects 50-60 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently available longitudinal data in DS suggest a high rate of transition to dementia&#xD;
      from the late 40s through the early 50s of these individuals. This, together with the&#xD;
      universal presence of plaques in DS by their mid 40s makes this age range ideal for studying&#xD;
      the development of AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The overall goal of this project is to determine the relationships among the clinical,&#xD;
      cognitive, imaging, genetic and biochemical biomarker characteristics of the entire spectrum&#xD;
      of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the pathology evolves from normal aging through very mild&#xD;
      symptoms, to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), to dementia in adults with Down syndrome. This&#xD;
      is a pilot study modeled after the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to&#xD;
      inform the neuroscience community of AD in DS, identify diagnostic and prognostic markers,&#xD;
      identify outcome measures that can be used in clinical trials, and help develop the most&#xD;
      effective clinical trial scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AD is the most common dementia in humans and over the next decades will account for a major&#xD;
      and increasing morbidity and mortality in the US and worldwide. AD is usually a sporadic&#xD;
      disease and the commonly accepted hypothesis as to its etiology is the amyloid cascade&#xD;
      hypothesis. There is tremendous activity in the pharmaceutical industry and academia directed&#xD;
      towards development of disease modifying treatments, most commonly targeting amyloid, but&#xD;
      also tau and other mechanisms. Most efforts are directed towards Mild to Moderate AD or&#xD;
      prodromal AD with relatively little work on prevention of AD due to various challenges,&#xD;
      including identification of healthy people who would be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal disorder in humans, caused by triplication of&#xD;
      chromosome 21, accounting for ~1/740 live births in the USA even with routine prenatal&#xD;
      screening. In addition to mental retardation and the other classical signs of DS, 100% of&#xD;
      people with DS will develop the pathological hallmarks of AD (plaques and tangles) by their&#xD;
      40s and ~80% of people with DS will eventually develop clinical dementia. The primary cause&#xD;
      is the triplication of the APP gene on chromosome 21, resulting in 50% greater levels of both&#xD;
      APP mRNA and protein. That the disease in DS is indeed AD is supported by pathological,&#xD;
      molecular, in-vitro, biomarker and clinical evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with DS have been followed at major centers in the US and EU for decades with large&#xD;
      amounts of clinical and psychometric data gathered and analyzed. There is, however, very&#xD;
      little data on CSF biomarkers due to the difficulty of performing lumbar punctures in DS&#xD;
      subjects. Only recently has data begun to be gathered from imaging modalities, including&#xD;
      Amyloid imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of AD in this population and, due to the MR, the&#xD;
      standard instruments cannot be used. Most major centers have developed specific instruments&#xD;
      that can follow cognitive and functional performance and allow the detection of dementia. The&#xD;
      data gathered over the past decades allows the construction of a curve describing the&#xD;
      transition to dementia in this population and shows the transition beginning in the mid 40s&#xD;
      with a steep slope around the age of 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DS is, in effect, a population highly enriched for people who will, with a very high&#xD;
      probability develop AD, and it is expected that only with an ADNI-like study can the&#xD;
      investigators better understand the trajectory of transition to dementia in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this project is to develop treatments for the prevention of AD in this&#xD;
      population. Because if the investigators would know at what age the slope of transition to&#xD;
      dementia is steepest, a study could be done in a specific age range and require much fewer&#xD;
      subjects and time and expense than a study in the general population (where it is currently&#xD;
      impossible to determine which healthy individuals will likely develop dementia over the next&#xD;
      few years and even if there were, thousands would have to be screened to ID these few). A&#xD;
      study in the general population might need to enroll tens of thousands of subjects to observe&#xD;
      sufficient transitions to dementia. The investigators estimate that such a study in DS would&#xD;
      require about 170 subjects per arm for a 36 month study. Success in such a study would&#xD;
      provide the confidence to commit the resources for a larger study in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above, there is minimal CSF data and imaging is only beginning. Thus biomarkers&#xD;
      for AD in DS are less developed than in the general population. Additional biomarkers could&#xD;
      be helpful in studying AD in DS. A biomarker that could increase the ability to predict&#xD;
      transition to dementia in an individual (as opposed to the investigators current ability on a&#xD;
      population level) would increase the efficiency of any study. The ability to track the&#xD;
      progression or improvement of dementia might also be useful. If a biomarker indicated&#xD;
      transition to dementia earlier than any clinical instrument, a prevention study could&#xD;
      conceivably be conducted at younger ages with greater chance of success. In addition to DS,&#xD;
      such a biomarker would also be useful in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot study for a larger scale biomarker study which, as described, would&#xD;
      enable better understanding of biomarkers and the natural history of AD in DS.&#xD;
