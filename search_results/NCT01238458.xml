    <textblock>
      This study will recruit a total of 150 evaluable subjects (30 cognitively normal volunteers,&#xD;
      and 60 MCI(Mild cognitive impairment), and 60 AD(Alzheimer's disease), respectively) Each&#xD;
      evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria according the subject grouping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety measurement will be evaluated by medical history, vital signs, physical examinations,&#xD;
      laboratory examinations and collecting of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is expected to be completed in a period of 3 years.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this protocol is to address the feasibility of clinical utilization&#xD;
      of [18F]AV-45 in various neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we will expand the&#xD;
      database of [18F]AV-45 PET imaging in Alzheimer's disease and MCI patients to refine the&#xD;
      definition of a positive scan in patient with AD and MCI as compared to healthy control.&#xD;
      Secondary, we will expand the safety database of [18F]AV-45 PET imaging. In addition, the&#xD;
      image characteristics and prevalence of Aß positivity will be evaluated in different subsets&#xD;
      of MCI and AD patients.&#xD;

To understand prevalence of Aß positivity in patients with MCI and AD. Images will be visually examined by a trained radiologist or nuclear medicine physician who is blinded to the subject diagnosis and will be reported as either Aβ positive (AD-like) or Aβ negative (not AD-like). The prevalence of Aß positivity in patients with MCI and AD will be recorded for comparison.</description>
