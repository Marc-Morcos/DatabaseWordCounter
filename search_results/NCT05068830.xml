    <textblock>
      Introduction Given that exercise training reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (AD), induces changes in the blood composition and has widespread systemic benefits, it is&#xD;
      reasonable to hypothesize that exercised plasma may have rejuvenative properties. The main&#xD;
      objective is to test safety and tolerability of transfusing exercised plasma (ExPlas) from&#xD;
      young, healthy, fit adults to patients with early AD. The study is a pilot for a future&#xD;
      efficacy study. The key secondary objectives are examining the effect of plasma transfusions&#xD;
      on cognitive function, fitness level, vascular risk profile, assessment of cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow and hippocampal volume, quality of life, functional connectivity assessed by resting&#xD;
      state functional MRI and biomarkers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis ExPlas is a double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical single center&#xD;
      trial. Patients aged 50-75 years with diagnosis mild cognitive impairment or early AD will be&#xD;
      recruited from two Norwegian hospitals. ExPlas is plasma drawn by plasmapheresis once a month&#xD;
      for 4 months, from a total of 30 donors (aged 18-40, BMI ≤27 kg/m2 and VO2max &gt;50 mL/kg/min).&#xD;
      All units will be virus inactivated by the Intercept method in accordance with procedures at&#xD;
      St. Olavs Hospital. Comparison with isotonic saline allows differentiation from a non-blood&#xD;
      product. The main study consists of 6 rounds of examinations in addition to 12 plasma&#xD;
      transfusions divided over three 4-weeks periods during study year-1. Follow-up examinations&#xD;
      after 2 and 5 years after baseline is also planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants and&#xD;
      participation is voluntary. All participants have a next of kin who will follow them&#xD;
      throughout the study and represent the patient's interest. The study is approved by the&#xD;
      Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK 2018/702) and the Norwegian&#xD;
      Medicines Agency (EudraCT No. 2018-000148-24).&#xD;
