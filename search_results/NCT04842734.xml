    <description>Supervised Physical Exercise Program (SPEP) sessions will be performed simultaneously online together with the physiotherapist and the patient. Participants will be able to do the exercises together with their caregivers if needed.&#xD;
The Computerized Cognitive Stimulation Program (CCSP) (Beynex) will be planned for 12 weeks, 5 days a week, approximately 10 minutes, for a total of 40 sessions.&#xD;
Fisrtly, the use of CCSP will be demonstrated to the patients. Then, it will be given as home program. While the patients play the games in CCSP via their smartphones, their caregivers will be informed in detail about accompanying the patients if they need it. The follow-up of cognitive stimulation will be made with the person accompanying the patient over the phone.&#xD;
Individuals will be evaluated by a physiotherapist who will perform the assessment at pre-treatment, post-treatment (12th week) and follow-up period (24th week).</description>
