  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent findings suggest that sleep disruption may contribute to the generation and&#xD;
      maintenance of neuropsychiatric symptoms including anxiety, depression, agitation,&#xD;
      irritation, and apathy while treating sleep disruption reduces these symptoms. Impairments in&#xD;
      the neural systems that support emotion regulation may represent one causal mechanism&#xD;
      mediating the relationship between sleep and emotional distress. However, this model has not&#xD;
      yet been formally tested within a sample of individuals with or at risk for developing&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal aims to test a mechanistic model in which sleep disturbance contributes to&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms through impairments in fronto-limbic emotion regulation function in&#xD;
      a sample of individuals at risk for developing, or at an early stage of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to delineate the causal association between sleep disruption, fronto-limbic&#xD;
      emotion regulation brain function, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. These aims will be achieved&#xD;
      through a mechanistic, randomized 2-arm controlled trial design. 150 adults experiencing&#xD;
      sleep disturbances and who also have cognitive impairment with the presence of at least mild&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms will be randomized to receive either a sleep manipulation&#xD;
      (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia CBT-I; n=75) or an active control (n=75). CBT-I&#xD;
      improves sleep patterns through a combination of sleep restriction, stimulus control,&#xD;
      mindfulness training, cognitive therapy targeting dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and&#xD;
      sleep hygiene education. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, fronto-limbic functioning, and sleep&#xD;
      disruption will be assessed at baseline and at the end of the sleep manipulation through&#xD;
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), clinical interviews, PSG recordings, and&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety and depression) and sleep&#xD;
      disturbance (actigraphy, Insomnia Severity Index, and sleep diaries) will be assayed at&#xD;
      baseline and each week throughout the sleep manipulation to assess week-to-week changes&#xD;
      following an increasing number of CBT-I sessions. Wristwatch actigraphy will be acquired from&#xD;
      baseline to the end of the sleep manipulation at week 11. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep&#xD;
      will be assessed again at six months post-manipulation.&#xD;

    <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI) examines 12 sub-domains of behavioral functioning. We will be using a summed composite score of 7 domains (agitation/aggression, dysphoria, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, and irritability/lability) as the primary outcome measure as these domains have been most closely related to sleep disturbance. Frequency of symptoms for each domain are rated on a scale of 0 - 4 (Higher scores indicate symptoms occur more frequently). Severity / intensity of symptoms are rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms). The overall summed composite score will be created by summing the total score for each of the 7 domains of interest (total = frequency * severity). This will yield an overall summed composite score ranging from 0 to 84 (higher scores indicate worse symptoms).</description>

    <description>The participant's subjective experience of severity of insomnia using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The ISI has been shown to be a reliable subjective measure of insomnia severity as well as a sensitive measure of symptom change. Recently it has also been related to objective polysomnography measures. The scale ranges from 0 to 28, with a score of 0-7 indicating no clinically significant insomnia, scores 8-14 indicating sub threshold insomnia, 15-21 indicating moderate insomnia and 22-28 indicating severe insomnia.</description>

    <description>CBT-I improves sleep through a combination of behavioral interventions (stimulus control (SC), sleep restriction (SR)), cognitive therapy (CT) as well as additional components such as mindfulness training and sleep hygiene education. SC is an intervention that re-establishes the connection between the bed/bedroom with sleep to help develop a more consistent sleep/wake pattern. SR leads to higher quality sleep by reducing excessive time spent in bed to the actual amount of sleep, thereby creating mild sleep deprivation and increasing the homeostatic sleep drive. Like CT for other disorders, CT for insomnia targets maladaptive thoughts and cognitions that may interfere with sleep.</description>

    <description>DT-I is a quasidesensitization treatment presented as a means of eliminating the &quot;conditioned arousal,&quot; which prolongs nocturnal awakenings. DT-I has been validated as an active-placebo control condition. Therapists help each DT-I recipient develop a chronological 12-item hierarchy of common activities he/she does on awakening at night (e.g., opening eyes, clock watching). Therapists also help them develop 6 imaginal scenes of themselves engaged in neutral activities (e.g., reading the newspaper). Each session, DT-I recipients are taught to pair neutral scenes with items on the 12-item hierarchy so, by the end of the sixth session, all hierarchy items have been practiced with therapist assistance. Each session, the exercise is tape recorded and the patient is given this tape locked in a player. The patients are told to practice their exercises at home once each day, no less than 2 hours before bedtime, but to avoid using the tape or exercise during sleep periods.</description>
