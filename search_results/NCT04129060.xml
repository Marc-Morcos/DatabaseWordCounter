      Women are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Notably at menopause, some women&#xD;
      experience a change in cognition. However, not all women experience negative effects of&#xD;
      menopause on cognition. The cognitive changes that occur at menopause have not yet been&#xD;
      connected to late life risk for pathological aging including AD. Thus, understanding the&#xD;
      neurobiological factors related to individual differences in cognition at menopause is&#xD;
      critical for understanding normal cognitive aging and for determining risk for pathological&#xD;
      aging. The challenge in understanding the role of estrogen loss on the risk for AD is the&#xD;
      long lag time between the hormonal changes at menopause and the clinical manifestations of&#xD;
      AD. Thus, identifying how the hormone changes after menopause are related to AD risk will&#xD;
      alter the risk calculus for postmenopausal women in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel study proposed here will examine an established AD-related neurotransmitter-based&#xD;
      mechanism that may also underlie cognitive changes after menopause. The investigators propose&#xD;
      that the change in the hormonal milieu at menopause interacts with the cholinergic system and&#xD;
      other brain pathologies to influence a woman's risk for cognitive decline. Preclinical&#xD;
      studies have shown that estrogen is necessary for normal cholinergic functioning and its&#xD;
      withdrawal leads to cholinergic dysfunction and cognitive impairment. It is important to&#xD;
      determine whether menopause-related cognitive changes correlate with both cholinergic&#xD;
      functional integrity and established AD biomarkers that portend increased risk for late-life&#xD;
      cognitive impairment or dementia. This study will examine brain functioning following&#xD;
      cholinergic blockade to separate individuals into those who are able to compensate for the&#xD;
      hormone change after menopause and those who are not. The investigators hypothesize women&#xD;
      with poor compensation have increased sensitivity to cholinergic blockade by showing poor&#xD;
      performance on a cognitive task, altered brain activation, and decreased basal forebrain&#xD;
      cholinergic system (BFCS) volume. These cholinergic markers will be related to menopausal&#xD;
      factors associated with poor cognition and biomarkers of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 is to examine cholinergic functional &quot;integrity&quot; by measuring working memory&#xD;
      performance, functional brain activation, and BFCS structure in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 will examine whether individual differences in menopause-relevant symptoms and&#xD;
      known AD biomarkers are related to cognition and brain activation after anticholinergic&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The public health significance of this study is that it will identify individual difference&#xD;
      factors that are associated with cognitive performance changes after menopause and their&#xD;
      relationship to structural, functional, and biomarker evidence of risk for later life&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction. Knowledge of these factors will serve to advance personalized future&#xD;
      risk-mitigation strategies for women including hormonal, medication, cognitive remediation,&#xD;
      etc. that will be the subject of further research.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The brain is a major target for circulating gonadal steroids and the change in hormone levels&#xD;
      after menopause is likely to have implications for cognitive functioning. A number of&#xD;
      clinical and preclinical studies have linked gonadal steroids and cognition (e.g.1,2) and it&#xD;
      has been hypothesized that menopause has detrimental effects on cognition that are over and&#xD;
      above the expected effects of normal aging. While menopause results in reproductive&#xD;
      senescence, most of the symptoms of menopause are neurological3. However, evidence for&#xD;
      changes in brain functioning after menopause is equivocal. Some studies found that cognitive&#xD;
      performance after menopause decreased in domains such as memory, attention, problem solving,&#xD;
      and motor skills from pre-menopausal levels (e.g.1,4,5). As many as 60% of women reported&#xD;
      undesirable memory changes at mid-life6. Other studies have not found changes in cognition&#xD;
      after menopause (e.g.7-9) and not all women experience negative effects of menopause on&#xD;
      cognition10. However, women have a higher risk of dementia compared to men11 and many&#xD;
      hypotheses identify the sex differences in gonadal steroids and the hormone change at&#xD;
      menopause as related to risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and/or dementia. The challenge in&#xD;
      understanding the role of estrogen loss on the risk for AD is the long lag time between the&#xD;
      hormonal changes at menopause and the clinical manifestations of AD. Thus, identifying how&#xD;
      the hormone changes after menopause are related to AD risk will alter the risk calculus for&#xD;
      postmenopausal women in the future. In addition, the neurobiological processes underlying how&#xD;
      the change in the hormonal environment at menopause influences brain functioning, what&#xD;
      factors are responsible for individual differences in cognition after menopause, and what&#xD;
      menopause-related symptoms are associated with risk for dementia are not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One mechanism hypothesized to be responsible for cognitive changes post menopause is the&#xD;
      effect of decreased estradiol on the functioning of neurotransmitter systems that support&#xD;
      cognition. The importance of the estrogen-cholinergic system interaction for cognition has&#xD;
      been demonstrated across a number of model systems from rats12 to non-human primates13 to&#xD;
      humans14. The investigators have shown that estrogen's interaction with the cholinergic&#xD;
      system is important for cognitive functioning in postmenopausal women14-16. What has not not&#xD;
      yet shown is how change in cholinergic system functioning as a result of menopause is related&#xD;
      to menopausal signs/symptoms that influence cognition as well as AD biomarkers like amyloid,&#xD;
      tau, and neurodegeneration. These are important relationships to understand and may lead to&#xD;
      individual risk profiles that can be observed earlier in the aging process while treatment&#xD;
      and prevention strategies may be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will investigate the role of cholinergic system in cognitive functioning in&#xD;
      women after menopause. We have been examining the interaction of the neurotransmitter&#xD;
      acetylcholine with hormones after menopause for a number of years14-16. In these studies with&#xD;
      intensive repeated measures designs where the sample sizes were relatively small, findings&#xD;
      generally showed no benefit of estrogen therapy alone for cognition in normal women post&#xD;
      menopause. However, if the investigators induced a temporary impairment in the cholinergic&#xD;
      system, the beneficial effect of estradiol became manifest15 and this was more prominent in&#xD;
      younger postmenopausal women aged 50-60 compared to older women aged 70-8014. Furthermore,&#xD;
      these studies showed significant heterogeneity of individual responses with roughly 50% of&#xD;
      women showing either compensatory or impaired responses suggesting individual differences in&#xD;
      risk profile (see preliminary data). What has not yet demonstrated is how the sensitivity of&#xD;
      the cholinergic system to temporary blockade is related to menopause symptoms and known AD&#xD;
      biomarkers that are associated with increased risk for AD development or frank dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that cholinergic antagonist drugs can be used to expose the effects&#xD;
      of menopause on cognitive functioning. Decreased cognitive performance during a temporary&#xD;
      cholinergic blockade &quot;lesion&quot; may be an indicator of susceptibility to the negative effects&#xD;
      of hormone withdrawal on the brain and risk for age-related cognitive impairment and/or&#xD;
      dementia. The study proposed here will be the first to link cholinergic sensitivity to&#xD;
      biomarkers of neurodegeneration and AD pathology. Specifically, the study will investigate&#xD;
      working memory performance and brain activation during a cholinergic antagonist challenge&#xD;
      compared to placebo and examine how factors associated with menopause like gonadal steroids,&#xD;
      autonomic symptoms, mood, and sleep as well as known biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (e.g. age, subjective cognitive complaints, hippocampal and basal forebrain volume,&#xD;
      beta amyloid, and tau load) combine to predict which women are likely to experience cognitive&#xD;
      impairment during the cholinergic challenge procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from this study will further the understanding of the neurotransmitter-based&#xD;
      mechanisms responsible for cognitive changes after menopause and how these may predict late&#xD;
      life cognitive dysfunction. After an examination of the neurobiology underlying the cognitive&#xD;
      change at menopause, future studies can develop strategies to mitigate pathological processes&#xD;
      that are enhanced by the menopausal hormone change.&#xD;
