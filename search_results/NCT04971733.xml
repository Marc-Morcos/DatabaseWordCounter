    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) infusions of E2814 in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD),&#xD;
      and to evaluate target engagement (TE) of E2814 on microtubule binding region (MTBR)-tau&#xD;
      species in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in participants with DIAD.&#xD;

&#xD;
         24. Concurrent participation in a clinical study involving any anti-amyloid therapies&#xD;
