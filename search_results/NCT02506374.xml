  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-intervention qualitative study will use focus groups to assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of a proposed intervention for a future study. The focus group will discuss a&#xD;
      potential biobehavioral family self-management intervention designed to improve sleep in&#xD;
      persons with Alzheimer's disease (PAD) and their caregivers (CG).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 16 caregivers of home-based PAD/CG dyads (person with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease/caregiver dyads) will be recruited from the community. A series of two audiotaped&#xD;
      focus groups will be conducted with these caregiver participants. The first focus group will&#xD;
      explore perspectives on what constitutes a feasible and acceptable intervention to improve&#xD;
      their sleep and associated symptoms. The second focus group will consist of follow up and&#xD;
      confirmation of findings from the first focus group. The intervention will be developed and&#xD;
      refined based upon focus group findings.&#xD;
