      Eligible patients will undergo this open label initial safety and feasibility study&#xD;
      investigating the use of 6 g/day sodium oxybate in mild AD. A total of 5 visits are included&#xD;
      with this trial and total subject participation duration of 7-8 weeks. The screening phase&#xD;
      will include an initial screening visit and a screening PSG night. After successful&#xD;
      screening, subjects will complete a baseline PSG night and undergo a third PSG night to&#xD;
      monitor initial safety and compliance with study drug at a dosage of 4.5 g/day of sodium&#xD;
      oxybate. Thus the subject will undergo three consecutive nights of PSG in the sleep center.&#xD;
      The patient will maintain a dosage of 4.5 g/day for a duration of 7 days leading to Treatment&#xD;
      Visit 1. After successful assessment at Treatment Visit 1, the dosage will be increased to 6&#xD;
      g/day for the duration of the trial. At Treatment Visit 2 (day 21), the dosage will be&#xD;
      increased to a dosage of 9 g/day, if tolerated by the patient. The remaining visit will occur&#xD;
      at 6 weeks after baseline, with Treatment Visit 3 consisting of two consecutive nights of&#xD;
      PSG. Participation will be complete after this visit. Phone follow-up will be made at one&#xD;
      week post completion visits to assess any wash-out symptoms. Please refer to Figure for flow&#xD;
      of the study design.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Screening Visit (Day -14 to -7): To avoid confusion, all study visits will occur at the&#xD;
      Clayton Sleep Institute. A spouse or caregiver is required to attend all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit potential patients will provide informed consent, which must&#xD;
      signed by both the patient and the caregiver, followed by a medical and sleep history and&#xD;
      physical, completion of the Morse Fall Scale, CDR scale, and the Mini-Mental Status exam&#xD;
      (MMSE), as well as the drawing of clinical labs, collection of urine drug screen, and&#xD;
      completion of 12-lead ECG. Mild AD patients must have a previous clinical diagnosis according&#xD;
      to established criteria. Review of concomitant medications, stimulant usage, and vital signs&#xD;
      will also be recorded. In order to assess for sleep quality, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality&#xD;
      Index (PSQI) will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet study criteria will be asked to continuously wear a wrist actigraph&#xD;
      (Actiwatch Score; Mini Mitter Co., Inc, Sunriver, OR) from the screening visit through the&#xD;
      baseline visit. Each subject will be instructed to press an event button at bedtime and upon&#xD;
      awakening in the morning. Data collection will be in 60 second epochs. A handwritten sleep&#xD;
      and caregiver diary will be maintained for the duration of the study period to document daily&#xD;
      bedtime, wake time, stimulant usage as well as provide daily estimates of sleep latency,&#xD;
      total sleep time, and sleep quality, as well as dosing compliance, adverse events, and&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit (Day 0-2): The baseline visit will occur 1-2 weeks after the screening visit&#xD;
      to allow for a medication washout period if needed. Participants will be asked to arrive at&#xD;
      the sleep center at 7:30 PM each of the three nights. During the evening of all three testing&#xD;
      nights, concomitant medication and stimulant usage and adverse events will be reviewed, as&#xD;
      well as gait stability assessment and vital signs performed. Night one will consist of a&#xD;
      screening PSG to assess for potential sleep disorders. Patients who do not meet exclusion&#xD;
      criteria for sleep disorders after night one will be excluded from the study. Participants&#xD;
      will be allowed to leave in the morning after the screening PSG and return that evening.&#xD;
      Night two will again consist of a full PSG, with this night serving as baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hours after the completion of the PSG, patients will complete a battery of tests&#xD;
      measuring daytime functioning, memory function, and neurobehavioral testing. Measures include&#xD;
      the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Clayton Daytime Functioning&#xD;
      Scale (CDFS), PSQI, PVT, the National Adult Reading Test- Revised (NART-R), Rey Auditory&#xD;
      Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Kendrick Object Learning Task (KOLT), and the Cambridge&#xD;
      Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG). Following the battery of measurements, a study physician will&#xD;
      complete the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Severity (CIBIS) during this visit for&#xD;
      the mild AD patients and complete the Caregiver Distress Scale (NPI-CDS). Finally, the&#xD;
      Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) questionnaire will be given and completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Night three will once again be an all night PSG to specifically monitor and assess compliance&#xD;
      and side effects with the first study drug dosage. A dosage of 4.5 g/day of sodium oxybate&#xD;
      will be used for this study night and for the first week of treatment. Prior to the PSG the&#xD;
      subject and caregiver will be given instructions for the usage of the study drug with the&#xD;
      caregiver to assist in the measuring and dosing of the study drug. Following completion of&#xD;
      the PSG, enough study drug for one week will be dispensed. The actigraph and sleep/caregiver&#xD;
      diary will be collected, with new diaries given to be completed until the next visit. Phone&#xD;
      follow-up will be made 3 days later to assess study drug compliance and any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visit 1 (Day 7): Approximately one week after completion of the baseline visit, the&#xD;
      patient and caregiver will return to the sleep center for a daytime visit to assess study&#xD;
      drug compliance, adverse events, and caregiver report via the diary and CDS. The study&#xD;
      physician, with caregiver input, will complete the Caregiver Clinical Global Assessment of&#xD;
      Change (CCGIC) to assess any change in disease severity from baseline. Concomitant&#xD;
      medications and stimulant usage, gait stability, and vital signs will be assessed. The&#xD;
      battery of daytime functioning, sleep quality, memory and neurobehavioral, and quality of&#xD;
      life measures will be administered. Finally, remaining study drug will be collected and new&#xD;
      study drug dispensed with instructions to dose at 6 g/day of sodium oxybate provided to the&#xD;
      patient and caregiver. A new sleep/caregiver diary will be provided and an actigraph again&#xD;
      dispensed to be worn continuously through Treatment Visit 2. Phone follow-up will be made one&#xD;
      week later to assess study drug compliance and any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visit 2 (Day 21): Approximately three weeks after completion of the baseline visit,&#xD;
      the patient and caregiver will return to the sleep center for a daytime visit. All procedures&#xD;
      and assessments to be performed will be similar to Treatment Visit 1, with the addition of&#xD;
      clinical labs collected and a 12-lead ECG performed. Once again, remaining study drug will be&#xD;
      collected and new study drug dispensed with instructions to dose at 9 g/day of sodium oxybate&#xD;
      provided to the patient and caregiver, pending tolerability of the patient. If patient is&#xD;
      unable to tolerate the increased dosage or in the opinion of the investigator there is&#xD;
      question of tolerability, the dosage will remain at 6 g/day. The first phone follow-up will&#xD;
      be made 3 days post-visit to assess tolerability if the dosage was increased. Once again if&#xD;
      tolerability is in question, the dosage may be titrated back to 6 g/day. A new&#xD;
      sleep/caregiver diary will be provided. Phone follow-up will be made each week to assess&#xD;
      study drug compliance and any adverse events. Finally, the actigraph will dispensed once more&#xD;
      around day 30 (either mailed to the patient or picked up from the sleep center) with&#xD;
      instructions for the patient to continuously wear the actigraph through the final visit and&#xD;
      to press the event button at bedtime and waketime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visit 3 (Day 42): Approximately six weeks after completion of the baseline visit,&#xD;
      the patient and caregiver will return to the sleep center for Treatment Visit 3. The patient&#xD;
      and caregiver will arrive to the sleep center at 7:30 PM for both nights of PSG testing&#xD;
      performed at this study visit. Night one will serve as an adaptation night and night two for&#xD;
      data collection. All procedures and assessments to be performed will be similar to Treatment&#xD;
      Visit 2, with the battery of assessments following completion of PSG night two. All study&#xD;
      medication, sleep/caregiver diaries, and actigraph will be collected. An end of study&#xD;
      physical will be performed in conjunction with the other assessments. Active participation in&#xD;
      the study will be concluded with this visit. A final follow-up phone call will be made at one&#xD;
      week post final study visit to assess any final adverse events, especially as study drug is&#xD;
      withdrawn.&#xD;
