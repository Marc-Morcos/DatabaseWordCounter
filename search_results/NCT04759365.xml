    <textblock>
      ASN51-101 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 first in human (FIH)&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) study of oral ASN51 in&#xD;
      healthy young adult and elderly subjects and elderly subjects with AD. The study is comprised&#xD;
      of three parts (Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five (5) single-ascending oral doses will be administered to 40 healthy adult male or female&#xD;
      subjects (aged 18-55 years, inclusive). Escalation to the next higher dose level may occur&#xD;
      only after evaluation of the safety and PK results of the previous dose level (at least 6&#xD;
      evaluable subjects). Within each cohort, 6 subjects will receive one dose of ASN51, and 2&#xD;
      subjects will receive one dose of matching placebo. Based on this interim safety evaluation,&#xD;
      dose levels may be revised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple ascending oral doses will be administered to 24 healthy elderly subjects (aged 55 -&#xD;
      80 years, inclusive) in 3 sequential dosing groups (8 subjects in each dosing group). Six (6)&#xD;
      subjects will receive ASN51 and two (2) subjects will receive matching placebo in each dosing&#xD;
      group (cohort) for 10 days. Escalation to the next higher dose level may occur only after&#xD;
      evaluation of the safety and PK results of the previous dose level (at least 6 evaluable&#xD;
      subjects). Based on this interim safety evaluation, dose levels may be revised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of the subjects of each cohort will be administered as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 - 9: Twice daily (BID) dosing (or once daily (QD) dosing); to be defined after Part 1&#xD;
      (SAD) of ASN51 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 10: Only one dose will be administered in the morning of Day 10 Selection of the dosing&#xD;
      regimen and dose levels to be administered in Part 2 will be made by the safety review&#xD;
      committee (SRC), depending on the results of Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple oral doses will be administered to 12 AD subjects (aged 55-85, inclusive) in a&#xD;
      single dosing group for 10 days. Eight (8) AD subjects will receive ASN51 and four (4) AD&#xD;
      subjects will receive placebo in that dosing group (cohort). Selection of the dose level to&#xD;
      be administered in Part 3 will be made by the SRC and will depend on the results of study&#xD;
      Part 1 (SAD) and Part 2 (MAD), and will be below the maximum tolerated dose administered to&#xD;
      healthy subjects in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of the AD subjects will be administered as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 - 9: Twice daily (BID) dosing (or once daily (QD) dosing); to be defined after Part 2&#xD;
      (MAD) of ASN51 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 10: Only one dose will be administered in the morning of Day 10. Selection of the dosing&#xD;
      regimen and dose level to be administered in Part 3 will be made by the safety review&#xD;
      committee (SRC), depending on the results of both Part 1 and Part 2.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy as determined by the Investigator, based on a medical evaluation including&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, neurological examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the Investigator, the finding is (a) unlikely to introduce&#xD;
             additional risk to the subject, (b) will not interfere with study procedures or&#xD;
             confound study results, and (c) is not otherwise exclusionary (see Exclusion&#xD;
             Criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Men and women aged 18-55 years, inclusive, at Screening (Part 1) or 55-80 years,&#xD;
             inclusive, at Screening (Part 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must understand the nature of the study and provide signed and dated written&#xD;
             informed consent in accordance with local regulations before the conduct of any&#xD;
             study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to complete all study related testing and evaluations&#xD;

             consist of: (1) a condom for the male participant or partner of a female participant,&#xD;
             combined with (2) a highly effective method of contraception (e.g., a hormonal method&#xD;
             associated with suppression of ovulation, an intrauterine device [IUD]) for the female&#xD;
             participant or partner of a male participant. Abstinence from heterosexual intercourse&#xD;
             should only be used in place of contraception when this is consistent with the usual&#xD;
             and preferred lifestyle of the participant. For male subjects, contraception should&#xD;
             continue for 90 days after the last dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP,&#xD;
             one spermatic cycle). Male subjects should agree to refrain from sperm donation&#xD;
             throughout this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of non-childbearing potential must be post-menopausal (the last menstrual period&#xD;

             confirms post-menopausal status), or have no uterus, ovaries, or fallopian tubes (or&#xD;
             have their fallopian tubes tied). All women must have a negative pregnancy test result&#xD;
             before administration of test article. Women who are surgically sterile must provide&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Subject must be, in the opinion of the Investigator, able to participate in all&#xD;
             scheduled evaluations, likely to complete all required tests, and likely to be&#xD;
             compliant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects is fluent in the local language.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject agrees not to post any personal medical data related to the study or&#xD;
             information related to the study on any website or social media site (e.g., Facebook,&#xD;
