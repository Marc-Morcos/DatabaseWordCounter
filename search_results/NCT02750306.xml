    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the safety and efficacy of suvorexant (MK-4305) to improve sleep&#xD;
      in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary hypothesis for the study is that&#xD;
      suvorexant is superior to placebo in improving insomnia as measured by change from baseline&#xD;
      in polysomnography (PSG)-derived total sleep time (TST) at Week 4.&#xD;
