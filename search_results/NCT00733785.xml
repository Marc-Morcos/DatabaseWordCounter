      The present pharmacokinetic study is designed to further characterise the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      the RSG XR formulation manufactured in Crawley and aims to assess dose proportionality,&#xD;
      strength equivalence, the food effect and the pharmacokinetics after repeat dosing. The study&#xD;
      aims to enroll sufficient number of subjects to ensure 48 subjects complete Study Part 1 (6&#xD;
      period crossover design) and a further 12 subjects complete Study Part 2 (repeat dosing).&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following&#xD;
        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy male and female (not gender stratified) subjects aged 18-55 years inclusive -&#xD;
        healthy subjects are defined as individuals who are free from clinically significant&#xD;
        illness or disease as determined by their medical history, physical examination, laboratory&#xD;
        studies, ECGs, and other tests. A subject with clinical abnormality or laboratory&#xD;
        parameters outside the reference range for this age group may be included only if the&#xD;
        Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor considers that the findings will not introduce&#xD;
        additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Body weight greater than 50 kg (110lbs and Body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 30 kg/m2&#xD;
        Willing and able to give written informed consent, willing to participate for the full&#xD;
        duration of the study, and able to understand and follow instructions related to study&#xD;
        procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female subjects able to bear children must agree to use an adequate method of contraception&#xD;
        for the duration of the study and for 14 days after last dose (see for details of highly&#xD;
        effective methods to avoid pregnancy). Female subjects who are pre-menopausal or who have&#xD;
        been post-menopausal for less than 2 years must undertake pregnancy testing (serum test)&#xD;
        less than or equal to 7 days before Visit 1, which must be negative&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females, who are on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and whose menopausal status is in&#xD;
        doubt, will be required to use a highly effective method to avoid pregnancy, as outlined in&#xD;
        the protocol, if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must&#xD;
        discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
        For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and&#xD;
        the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation&#xD;
        of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of&#xD;
        a highly effective method to avoid pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria&#xD;
        apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening history and physical or&#xD;
        laboratory examination or any other medical condition or circumstance making the volunteer&#xD;
        unsuitable for participation in the study. Specific examples include, coronary artery&#xD;
        disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes, renal disease&#xD;
        and hypertension. If there is doubt on the appropriateness of a subject, that subject's&#xD;
        eligibility for the study must be reviewed with the medical monitor prior to enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of surgical procedures that might affect the absorption of rosiglitazone (e.g.,&#xD;
        partial/total gastrectomy, cholecystectomy) or any hepatic or biliary abnormalities such as&#xD;
        Gilbert's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14&#xD;
        drinks/week for men (1 drink = 150mls of wine or 360mls of beer or 45mls of hard liquor)&#xD;
        within 6 months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day. Positive urine drug screen (UDS) including&#xD;
        alcohol at screening or check-in visits.&#xD;
&#xD;

        beta-human chorionic gonadotropin test (females). Women who are pregnant, lactating, or&#xD;
        planning to become pregnant. Male subjects who are not willing to abstain from or use a&#xD;
        condom during sexual intercourse with pregnant or lactating females. Male subjects not&#xD;
        willing to use a condom, plus another form of contraception (e.g., spermicide, IUD, birth&#xD;
        control pills taken by female partner, diaphragm with spermicide) if engaging in sexual&#xD;
        intercourse with a female who could become pregnant. Male subjects not willing to adhere to&#xD;
        these contraceptive criteria from administration of study medication until completion of&#xD;
        follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female subjects not willing to use proposed contraceptive methods. Use of prescription or&#xD;
        non-prescription drugs [in particular known inhibitors of cytochrome 2C8 (Gemfibrozil,&#xD;
        trimethoprim, glitazone, monteleucast, quercetin) or inducer (rifampin)], vitamins, herbal&#xD;
        and dietary supplements (including St. John's Wort) within 14 days or 5 half-lives&#xD;
        (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. Excluded from this list&#xD;
        are acetaminophen and paracetamol at doses of less than or equal to 2 grams/day, thyroid&#xD;
        replacement therapy, and hormonal methods of contraception (including oral contraceptives,&#xD;
        injectable progesterone, progestin subdermal implants and progesterone-releasing IUDs, but&#xD;

        medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of sensitivity to heparin, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or sensitivity to any&#xD;
        of the study medications or components thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone, or any of the excipients in the formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Systolic BP greater than 140 mm Hg and/or Diastolic BP greater than 90 mm Hg at screening&#xD;
        or check-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        QTc (machine read) greater than 450 ms on the screening ECG. History of glucose intolerance&#xD;
        (serum glucose greater than 110 mg/dl or 6.1 mmol/L after 8 hours fasting) Subjects have&#xD;
        had treatment with a new molecular entity (investigational drug) or any other trial during&#xD;
        the previous 30 days or five half-lives, whichever is longer. (the washout is from last&#xD;
        dose of study medication in the previous study until the first dose of study medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current evidence of drug abuse or history of drug abuse within one year of allocation&#xD;

        restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study Unlikely to comply&#xD;
        with the protocol requirements, instructions and study-related restrictions; e.g.,&#xD;

        completing the study Subject is the investigator or any sub-investigator, research&#xD;
        assistant, pharmacist, study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved&#xD;
        in the conduct of the study.&#xD;
