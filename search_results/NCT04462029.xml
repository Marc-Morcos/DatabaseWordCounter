      A total of 18 subjects will be randomized into 6 sequence groups. The investigational&#xD;
      products will be administered according to the treatment groups (R, T1, and T2) assigned to&#xD;
      each sequence group in Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3. In between each period, there will&#xD;
      be a washout period (28 days) long enough for the administered IP to be metabolized and&#xD;
      eliminated.&#xD;
