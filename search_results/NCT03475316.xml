  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dancing is a complex sensorimotor rhythmic activity that integrates cognitive, physical, and&#xD;
      social components and is applicable to seniors with various fitness levels. Despite its&#xD;
      popularity, there is a paucity of studies that have systematically examined the role of&#xD;
      dancing in preventing or delaying cognitive decline in older adults at high risk for&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. This preliminary randomized clinical trial will&#xD;
      help provide the evidence base to develop a definitive full-scale trial to support or refute&#xD;
      prescription of social dancing to prevent further cognitive decline in older adults at high&#xD;
      risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social dancing is a complex sensorimotor rhythmic activity integrating physical, cognitive&#xD;
      and social elements with the potential to ameliorate a wide range of physical and cognitive&#xD;
      impairments in older individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias.&#xD;
      The few extant studies report that dancing stimulates multiple cognitive processes, including&#xD;
      attention, processing speed, and executive function, but these discoveries were made in small&#xD;
      samples, lacking control conditions, and did not investigate the underlying biological&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Executive function (EF) is an umbrella term for the management of cognitive processes,&#xD;
      including working memory, reasoning, task flexibility, and problem solving that are central&#xD;
      to planning, goal-directed action, and coordination of daily activities. Impairment of EF and&#xD;
      related processes such as processing speed and attention is seen in normal aging as well as&#xD;
      early in dementia, and is associated with difficulty in performing daily activities and&#xD;
      increased risk of adverse events such as falls. Encouragingly, aerobic exercise is reported&#xD;
      to enhance cognition, especially EF. Cognitively impaired seniors fall more, and have higher&#xD;
      prevalence and severity of balance and gait problems than cognitively intact fallers. Given&#xD;
      social dancing's multimodal cognitive and physical benefits; it may help maintain mobility&#xD;
      and reduce falls in individuals at risk for dementia. In support, the investigators reported&#xD;
      that older social dancers had better balance and gait than non-dancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a 6-month pilot single blind, randomized clinical trial (RCT)&#xD;
      comparing social dancing (ballroom dancing) versus active control (walking) in 32 older&#xD;
      adults at high risk of dementia. The overall hypothesis is that social dancing in cognitively&#xD;
      vulnerable seniors will induce neuroplasticity that will enhance cognitive processes and&#xD;
      improving everyday behaviors. The objective for this pilot trial is to obtain preliminary&#xD;
      data on intervention effects (trajectory and asymptote) on EF to design a full-scale RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social dancing appeals to older adults, has intrinsic value, is enjoyable, and has high&#xD;
      potential for sustainability. This trial is novel and high risk, but will provide the&#xD;
      evidence base to develop a definitive full-scale RCT to support or refute prescription of&#xD;
      social dancing to prevent cognitive decline in older adults at high risk of AD and related&#xD;
      dementias.&#xD;

    <measure>Executive Function (EF).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in EF will be measured through a composite score from 3 tests. (1) The Digit Symbol Substitution test is a measure of attention and speed of processing. Scoring is based on the total number of correct responses generated over 90 seconds. Higher values reflect better outcome. (2) Flanker Test is a measure of speed of processing, attention and inhibitory control. Scoring is based on accuracy and reaction time. Lower values reflect better outcome. (3) Walking While Talking (repeating alternating letters of the alphabet) gait speed (centimeters/second) will be measured using a electronic walkway system. Higher values reflect better outcome. The scores on the 3 tests are standardized and summed to obtain a single z-score. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean of the study population and a value of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuroplasticity.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging will be used to investigate neuroplasticity under three conditions: 'imagined Walking While Talking' task, Digit Symbol Substitution test and Flanker interference tests. Functional activation/deactivation patterns recorded by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in response to the three tests will be examined within each participant before and after the intervention. The values measured as factor scores reflect change in functional activation/deactivation covariance patterns from pre to post intervention as a function intervention (social dancing vs. treadmill walking). Larger absolute values reflect more change in functional activation/deactivation covariance patterns from pre to post intervention on each of the three tasks. There is no set minimum and maximum values of the scale.</description>

    <measure>Lifestyle Changes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Lifestyle changes will be measured at baseline and post-intervention through the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire. CHAMPS scale measures weekly frequency/week of moderate-intensity exercise-related activities. Scores range from 0 to 133 with higher score indicating more exercise</description>

        <title>Executive Function (EF).</title>
        <description>Improvement in EF will be measured through a composite score from 3 tests. (1) The Digit Symbol Substitution test is a measure of attention and speed of processing. Scoring is based on the total number of correct responses generated over 90 seconds. Higher values reflect better outcome. (2) Flanker Test is a measure of speed of processing, attention and inhibitory control. Scoring is based on accuracy and reaction time. Lower values reflect better outcome. (3) Walking While Talking (repeating alternating letters of the alphabet) gait speed (centimeters/second) will be measured using a electronic walkway system. Higher values reflect better outcome. The scores on the 3 tests are standardized and summed to obtain a single z-score. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean of the study population and a value of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean.</description>

        <title>Neuroplasticity.</title>
        <description>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging will be used to investigate neuroplasticity under three conditions: 'imagined Walking While Talking' task, Digit Symbol Substitution test and Flanker interference tests. Functional activation/deactivation patterns recorded by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in response to the three tests will be examined within each participant before and after the intervention. The values measured as factor scores reflect change in functional activation/deactivation covariance patterns from pre to post intervention as a function intervention (social dancing vs. treadmill walking). Larger absolute values reflect more change in functional activation/deactivation covariance patterns from pre to post intervention on each of the three tasks. There is no set minimum and maximum values of the scale.</description>

          <title>Neuroplasticity.</title>
          <description>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging will be used to investigate neuroplasticity under three conditions: 'imagined Walking While Talking' task, Digit Symbol Substitution test and Flanker interference tests. Functional activation/deactivation patterns recorded by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in response to the three tests will be examined within each participant before and after the intervention. The values measured as factor scores reflect change in functional activation/deactivation covariance patterns from pre to post intervention as a function intervention (social dancing vs. treadmill walking). Larger absolute values reflect more change in functional activation/deactivation covariance patterns from pre to post intervention on each of the three tasks. There is no set minimum and maximum values of the scale.</description>
          <population>Includes all participants who completed the baseline MRI session and was randomized, except 3 participants in the Social Dancing group and 2 participants in the Treadmill Walking group with incomplete tasks/session or corrupted data files.</population>

Treadmill Walking: Each session starts with 5-10 minutes of warm-up walking at comfortable speed. Speed is gradually increased to the level at which participants felt it is 'somewhat hard' for two 35 minute sessions with breaks in between followed by 5-10 minute cool down period (total 90 min to match dance group).</description>
