    <textblock>
      The proposed Phase 1 study will involve initial development and evaluation of a new service&#xD;
      called Social Activities For Engagement at Home or SAFE at Home (SaH). SaH will enable PWD to&#xD;
      participate in videoconference-based group activities with their peers-i.e., other PWD. SaH&#xD;
      sessions will be facilitated by highly trained &quot;Engagement Professionals,&quot; who will be SaH&#xD;
      staff members that have a background in recreation therapy, activity coordination, or a&#xD;
      similar field. The proposed study has three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop an Alpha version of&#xD;
      the SaH app, including app infrastructure and preliminary activity content for live group&#xD;
      sessions, as well as staff training and coaching modules. Aim 2. Examine the app's&#xD;
      acceptability/feasibility (by assessing attendance, session length, and engagement/affect).&#xD;
      Aim 3. Examine satisfaction with the app by directly eliciting feedback from PWD and life&#xD;
      enrichment staff.&#xD;

      Aim 1. Develop an Alpha version of the SAFE at Home app, including app infrastructure and&#xD;
      preliminary activity content for live group sessions, as well as staff training and coaching&#xD;
      modules. During Months 1-6, the Development Team (DT) will create the initial product design&#xD;
      and prototype for use in the study. The study team will engage 5 PWD, 5 family members, and 5&#xD;
      activity professionals in focus groups to review the mockups and to understand end user&#xD;
      preferences in terms of user experience and activity content. This will be the only&#xD;
      involvement for these participants. New participants will be recruited for the&#xD;
      quasi-experiment (described below). Aim 2. Examine the app's acceptability/feasibility (by&#xD;
      assessing attendance, session length, and engagement/affect) During Months 5-10, the&#xD;
      Experimental Team (ET) will utilize a quasi-experimental pre-post design (i.e., baseline vs.&#xD;
      treatment / post-treatment) to conduct a two-month long acceptability and feasibility trial&#xD;
      of SaH. During this trial 15 PWD, 15 Family Members, and 5 Life Enrichment professionals will&#xD;
      use the product to determine functionality, acceptability, and feasibility. Baseline and&#xD;
      Onboarding (Month 7). PWD: During the 4-week baseline period, the ET will collect the&#xD;
      following data. PWD Demographics, medications, diagnoses, and type of dementia will be&#xD;
      collected via proxy (family member) interview. The following assessments will be administered&#xD;
      directly: the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ-T), the Dementia Quality of&#xD;
      Life Scale (DEMQOL), the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS-SF), and the UCLA&#xD;
      Loneliness Scale (ULS). Researchers will interview family members (FMs) using the&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home (NPI-NH). Using the Menorah Park Engagement Scale.&#xD;
      researchers will observe PWD engagement and affect via videoconference on four days. This&#xD;
      will allow us to determine &quot;normal/baseline&quot; engagement levels for each PWD and serve as a&#xD;
      comparison for SaH. At the conclusion of the Baseline data collection, the ET will use the&#xD;
      Get to Know You Portal with each PWD to determine their Cognitive and Communication levels as&#xD;
      well as their interests. For the purposes of testing the feasibility of the SaH intervention,&#xD;
      all group assignments will be made solely through the use of SaH tools. Staff Demographics&#xD;
      will be collected. Staff will also take pre-training quizzes prior to taking the training&#xD;
      modules. Family Members (FMs) will provide demographic information and serve as proxies for&#xD;
      the above PWD measures. Intervention Period (Months 8-9). PWD: During the 8-week intervention&#xD;
      period, PWD will participate in SaH sessions through the Social Engagement Portal. Sessions&#xD;
      will occur twice per week and last 30-45 minutes. Staff: Staff will take the training modules&#xD;
      developed in Aim 1 and will also run a simulated group and provide feedback. FMs will be&#xD;
      involved simply by helping set up the hardware and helping their loved one with technical&#xD;
      issues as needed (e.g., reconnecting to the videoconference if the connection is lost). Post&#xD;
      Intervention Period (Month 10). PWD: The DEMQOL, GDS-SF, ULS, and NPI-NH will be&#xD;
      re-administered at Post-Intervention, allowing us to investigate possible long-term effects.&#xD;
      Changes on these longer-term measures are not expected in this Phase 1 study. However, data&#xD;
      will be used to conduct power analyses for Phase 2. Staff: Staff will take post-training&#xD;
      quizzes after completing the training modules. FMs will serve as proxies for some of the&#xD;
      above measures. Milestones. This Aim will be considered successfully met if: (1) At least 85%&#xD;
      of PWD agree to take part in 80% of the sessions. (2) Mean session length is least 25&#xD;
      minutes. (3) PWD exhibit higher levels of positive engagement/affect and lower levels of&#xD;
      negative engagement during SaH sessions, as compared to baseline (based upon the MPES). This&#xD;
      will be assessed by using paired samples t-tests. With the proposed sample, there will be a&#xD;
      power of 99% to detect effects. A detailed power analysis is included in Clinical&#xD;
      Trials-Statistical Design and Power. (4) Staff show an increase in knowledge after taking the&#xD;
      training modules, based upon paired samples t-tests (pre-training quizzes vs. post-training&#xD;
      quizzes). Aim 3. Examine satisfaction with the app by directly eliciting feedback from PWD&#xD;
      and life enrichment staff. Overview: This Aim occurs concurrently with the Intervention&#xD;
      Period for Aim 2 and utilizes the same sample and procedures-it merely tracks separate&#xD;
      outcomes. Intervention Period (Months 8-9). PWD: During the intervention period, PWD will&#xD;
      answer questions related to satisfaction at the end of each session. Staff: Staff will answer&#xD;
      satisfaction questions related to the course and to the app (after the run a simulated&#xD;
      group). FMs will answer satisfaction questions at the end of the study. Challenges. Since&#xD;
      this aim occurs concurrently with Aim 2, no distinct challenges related solely to Aim 3 are&#xD;
      expected. Milestones: This Aim will be considered successfully met if PWD, staff members, and&#xD;
      FMs report high satisfaction with the app, defined as 85% being satisfied or very satisfied.&#xD;
