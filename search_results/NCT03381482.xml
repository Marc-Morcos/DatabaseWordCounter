  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurofibrillary degeneration (NFD) is characterized by the&#xD;
      intraneuronal aggregation of Tau proteins. The pathology progresses through a hierarchical&#xD;
      pathway that may be associated with the intercellular transmission of pathology as&#xD;
      demonstrated in our rat models. This transmission implies that Tau is actively secreted and&#xD;
      may participate to the first steps of Tau pathology spreading. It is demonstrated in cell&#xD;
      lines and animal models (rodents and non-human primates) that Tau is secreted not only in&#xD;
      free forms but also in extracellular vesicles. If Tau is found in biological fluids before&#xD;
      neuronal death it may represent an early marker of the NFD and will also define&#xD;
      therapeutically targets. In this context, the aim is now to transfer this knowledge in humans&#xD;
      and to decipher the nature of Tau secreted in plasma and cerebrospinal fluids collected from&#xD;
      healthy controls to AD patients, and to decipher if the presence of tau inside vesicles is&#xD;
      influenced by the pathology.&#xD;

        Subjects intended to participate in group 1 have to undergo a lumbar puncture for other&#xD;
        reasons than a cognitive complaint. They will be identified in the anaesthesiology&#xD;
        department among patients who are waiting for scheduled orthopaedic surgery needing spinal&#xD;
        anaesthesia. They will have the sample collection done with its specific procedures in the&#xD;
        same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        if a subject is already followed at the MRRC and meets group 1 eligibility criteria, he/she&#xD;
        could be asked to participate in the study and thus be enrolled and followed by a MRRC&#xD;
        investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients intended to participate in groups 2 to 5 will be identified at the MRRC during&#xD;
        their scheduled visit with the investigators specialized in neurology/geriatric medicine.&#xD;
