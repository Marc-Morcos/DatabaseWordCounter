      The DETECT-AD study (stands for &quot;Digital Evaluations and Technologies Enabling Clinical&#xD;
      Translation for Alzheimer's Disease&quot;) is a new study designed to improve clinical trials for&#xD;
      early Alzheimer's disease. DETECT-AD uses specialized home-based digital devices (electronic&#xD;
      scale, electronic pill box, under-the-mattress sleep sensor, motion activity sensors, wrist&#xD;
      watch activity tracker, driving sensor, and computer software) to see if the devices will&#xD;
      improve clinical trial assessments. This 36- month-long study will simulate a clinical trial&#xD;
      to determine how well the home system detects clinically meaningful changes. Participants in&#xD;
      DETECT will receive a brain scan to assess their risk for developing Alzheimer's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the scan, homes will be outfitted with the devices*. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      simply go about their daily routines while data is collected in the background by the digital&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientists will see if there is a change in the digital assessments in four key areas of&#xD;
      life activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      mobility (walking speed), cognition (computer use), sleep (sleep times), and socialization&#xD;
      (time spent out of home). Participants will be asked to take a daily multivitamin as a study&#xD;
      'drug' to mimic clinical trial conditions. Using these methods, the DETECT study will produce&#xD;
      outcome measures that reflect real-world everyday function. Establishing the superiority of&#xD;
      these novel methods compared to conventional methods (for example, exams in a clinic) will&#xD;
      provide a potential new pathway for speeding the development of muchneeded new treatments for&#xD;
      Alzheimer's&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To achieve this objective, we propose the DETECT-AD (Digital Evaluations and Technologies&#xD;
      Enabling Clinical Translation for AD) Study. DETECT-AD is a prospective trial simulation&#xD;
      study using a current, extensible, sharable, technology agnostic, and home-based assessment&#xD;
      platform that continuously generates DBs and metrics of everyday cognition and function (or&#xD;
      Daily Indicators of Active Life - 'DIALS'). The platform also allows for remote capture of&#xD;
      conventional clinical assessments as well. A simulated trial study design is used, as there&#xD;
      are no current established therapies that will reliably improve meaningful function in stage&#xD;
      1-3 AD10 patients to a degree that one can directly test the sensitivity of DBs or DIALS to&#xD;
      treatment mediated change. In short, if there is no change over time in the proposed measure,&#xD;
      one would not know if it was a failure of the measure or the treatment. Hence, the use of the&#xD;
      simulation paradigm. In this trial, participants with known CNS amyloid (Aβ) status&#xD;
      (SUVR-based PET &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot;) will be enrolled. In the simulation, Aβ &quot;positive&quot;&#xD;
      (higher amyloid burden) patients will predictably progress, as if they were receiving&#xD;
      placebo; those with less amyloid (Aβ &quot;negative&quot;) will have less progression, simulating&#xD;
      effective treatment. Primary outcomes will be the change in DBs and DIALS composed of&#xD;
      measures in 4 key domains: mobility, cognition, sleep, and socialization. Exploratory&#xD;
      analyses of the relationship of the DBs with contemporary imaging (MRI) and blood-based&#xD;
      biomarkers related to inflammation, neurodegeneration, vascular risk or injury, and&#xD;
      nutritional health will also be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: Successful completion of this study will provide foundational validated DB and DIALS&#xD;
      data improving treatment response readout sensitivity, thus advancing AD clinical trial&#xD;
      capability and capacity. The intent is to not only validate a single app or device, but to&#xD;
      advance ecologically valid multi-domain assessment, as well as an entire trials-environment&#xD;
      specific, DB-facilitated protocol that could be adapted and shared for use by any clinical&#xD;
      trial or related study going forward.&#xD;
