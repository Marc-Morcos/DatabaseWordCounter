  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two-year safety study of simufilam (PTI-125) 100 mg oral tablets twice daily for&#xD;
      participants of the previous simufilam studies as wells as additional new mild-to-moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease subjects for a total of 200 participants. All participants will receive&#xD;
      simufilam 100 mg tablets twice daily for one year, followed by a 6-month randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind period where subjects will either continue on active treatment or be switched to&#xD;
      placebo. The study concludes with an additional 6-month open-label treatment period. Clinic&#xD;
      visits are every month or month and a half in the first year, and every 3 months in the&#xD;
      second year with an additional visit at Month 13. Cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms are&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The objectives of this study are to build the safety database for simufilam (PTI-125) and to&#xD;
      investigate its effects on biomarkers, cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms during&#xD;
      12-month twice-daily administration in mild-to-moderate AD patients. Additional objectives&#xD;
      are to assess differences in cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms between active and&#xD;
      placebo arms in the 6-month randomized period. All subjects will undergo lumbar puncture at&#xD;
      screening for baseline testing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau and Abeta42, and the&#xD;
      first 50 subjects will also provide a CSF sample at Month 6 or Month 12 for evaluation of&#xD;
      change from baseline in CSF biomarkers. CSF will not be required of subjects with prior CSF,&#xD;
      PET or MRI evidence of Alzheimer's disease. Plasma biomarkers will be evaluated in all&#xD;
      subjects. Safety will be assessed by blood tests, electrocardiograms, adverse event&#xD;
      monitoring and, at Months 12 and 24, full physical examinations.&#xD;

At Month12, participants will be randomized (1:1) to continue taking simufilam 100 mg b.i.d. or to be switched to placebo for 6 months. At Month 18, all participants will enter a final 6-month treatment period of open-label simufilam 100 mg b.i.d.</intervention_model_description>
