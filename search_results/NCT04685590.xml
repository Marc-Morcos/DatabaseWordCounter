    <measure>Change in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) slope</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>CDR is calculated on the basis of testing six different cognitive and behavioral domains such as memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies performance, and personal care. The CDR is based on a scale of 0-3: no dementia (CDR = 0), questionable dementia (CDR = 0.5), MCI (CDR = 1), moderate cognitive impairment (CDR = 2), and severe cognitive impairment (CDR = 3). The six domains are often summed to create a 0 - 18 &quot;sum of the boxes&quot; score. CDR-SB has been shown to demonstrate sensitivity to cognitive changes associated with progression of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and early Alzheimer's Disease (AD).</description>

    <measure>Change in the 14 - item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog 14) slope</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>A psychometric instrument that evaluates memory, attention, reasoning, language, orientation, and praxis. A higher score indicates more impairment. Scores from the original portion of the test range from 0 (best) to 65 (worse), and are added to the mean of the words not immediately recalled (max of 10) and the number of items not recalled after a delay (ranging from 0-10) all total the maximum score of 85. A positive change indicates cognitive worsening.</description>
