  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new radioactive compound used in positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) scans in identifying tau tangles (a certain protein that might be&#xD;
      associated with Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Disease) in the brain, and if the amount of&#xD;
      tau tangles in the brain has a relationship to cognitive status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves a PET scans using the radioactive compound, F 18 T807 for measurement of&#xD;
      tau deposition. This radioactive compound is not approved by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA). An MRI may also be conducted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that in vivo tau imaging will ultimately:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate the presence of tau fibrils in the brain during the pre-symptomatic stages&#xD;
           of cognitive decline, prior to cerebral atrophy, hypometabolism (as measured by 18F-FDG&#xD;
           PET imaging), and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate that the phenoconversion from cognitively normal (CN) status to early stages&#xD;
           of cognitive impairment will be closely correlated with neocortical F 18 T807 uptake and&#xD;
           that amyloid positive CN individuals who are positive for F 18 T807 will demonstrate&#xD;
           conversion to early dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate closely with the appearance of CSF markers of tau, including tau, p-tau, and&#xD;
           VILIP-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Co-localize with specific cognitive deficits (i.e. patients with tau deposition in the&#xD;
           left lateral temporal lobe will have primarily language deficits).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Predict the onset of dementia more accurately than existing biomarkers.&#xD;

        Participants are enrolled in the &quot;Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN)&#xD;
        Performance Site&quot; (IRB ID: 201109187) or the DIAN Extended Registry (EXR)&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants have met all eligibility criteria for enrollment into the &quot;Dominantly&#xD;
             Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN) Performance Site&quot; (IRB ID: 201109187) or the DIAN&#xD;
             Extended Registry (EXR)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female participants, at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Cognitively normal, or with mild dementia, as assessed clinically&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant is able and willing to undergo testing (MRI or CT, PET, radioactive tracer&#xD;
             injection; for those unable to undergo an MRI, CT will be used to generate&#xD;
             regions-of-interest).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pre-menopausal women will undergo a urine pregnancy test within 24 hours of drug&#xD;
             administration. Only negative pregnancy test result would allow the drug&#xD;
             administration to proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, could increase risk to the&#xD;
             participant, limit the participant's ability to tolerate the experimental procedures,&#xD;
             or interfere with the collection/analysis of the data (for example, participants with&#xD;
             severe chronic back pain might not be able to lie still during the scanning&#xD;
             procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Is deemed likely unable to perform the imaging procedures for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has a high risk for Torsades de Pointes or is taking medications known to prolong QT&#xD;
             interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has hypersensitivity to F 18 T807 or any of its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Contraindications to PET, PET-CT or MR (e.g. electronic medical devices, inability to&#xD;
             lie still for long periods) that make it unsafe for the individual to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Severe claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women who are currently pregnant or breast-feeding, and women who do not agree to use&#xD;
             reliable contraception, or to refrain from sexcual activity for 24 hours following&#xD;
             administration of the flortaucipir injection will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Other than DIAN study, currently participating in any research study and receiving an&#xD;
             active study medication for Alzheimer's Disearse, an investigational drug, device,&#xD;
             imaging, or placebo within the past 30 days before screening, and throughout this&#xD;
             clinical trial up to 2-weeks past any study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Other than DIAN study, current or recent (within 12 months prior to screening)&#xD;
             participation in research studies involving radioactive agents such that the total&#xD;
             research-related radiation dose to the participant in any given year would exceed the&#xD;
             limits set forth in the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 Section 361.1.&#xD;
             http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?FR=361.1. It is&#xD;
             the responsibility of each site to confirm the date of the most recent PET scan and to&#xD;
             work within the guidelines of the local Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC)&#xD;
             regarding the imaging interval.&#xD;
