  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intergenerational music programming has been shown to benefit both young people and older&#xD;
      adults in terms of quality of life, social connection, and promotion of positive cross-age&#xD;
      attitudes. During a time that older adults are facing increasing social isolation, a need&#xD;
      exists to offer meaningful programming that can reach older adults living with memory loss.&#xD;
      The investigators want to assess if an intergenerational music program that is delivered by&#xD;
      adolescent music facilitators is feasible and appropriate to both the young musicians and the&#xD;
      older adult participants. This program will be designed on Zoom but will able to be delivered&#xD;
      in the same manner in-person, offering it flexibility to reach a variety of participants.&#xD;
      This program is unique in that it brings together two populations who have shown to be&#xD;
      positively affected by engaging in music - adolescents and older adults with memory loss. As&#xD;
      a result of this work, teenage musicians will be empowered to adapt and share a music program&#xD;
      utilizing best research practices and create new connections with an older generation. Older&#xD;
      adults will receive a research-informed music program that will be geared to helping their&#xD;
      musical understanding and participation, as well as an opportunity to create new connections&#xD;
      with a younger generation. Findings from this work will generate a music program with clearly&#xD;
      defined ingredients that can be delivered and is accepted by both its facilitators and&#xD;
      participants, providing a foundation for future studies to assess outcomes such as social&#xD;
      connection, cognitive benefits, and emotional well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program will be built carefully utilizing stakeholder engagement from the adolescent&#xD;
      facilitators and older adult participants. Specifically, for Aim 1 the investigators will&#xD;
      explore the feasibility of the music program by its facilitators by conducting in-depth&#xD;
      interviews with a sample of adolescent facilitators before, during, and after they administer&#xD;
      the music intervention to discuss how best to adapt the program, as well as collecting&#xD;
      observations of the older adults to confirm engagement in the program. For Aim 2 the&#xD;
      investigators will assess its fidelity as the adolescent facilitators implement the program&#xD;
      and are assessed for adherence and competence. For Aim 3, the investigators will assess its&#xD;
      appropriateness, as adolescent facilitators and older adults will engage in focus groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research team will use qualitative and convergent mixed methods approaches to develop and&#xD;
      assess the feasibility and appropriateness of an intergenerational music program for older&#xD;
      adults with memory loss. With a paucity of research assessing the potential of an&#xD;
      intergenerational music program delivered by adolescents to older adults, it's important to&#xD;
      carefully build and assess the intervention utilizing principles of feasibility and&#xD;
      appropriateness. As discussed in feasibility methodology, principle data collection&#xD;
      methodology includes qualitative methods with stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Assess feasibility of delivering a music program to older adults for the young&#xD;
      musicians using qualitative methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial development: Pre-interview questions will be generated by the study team based an&#xD;
      existing digital music program, and post-interview questions will be guided by observations&#xD;
      of facilitators' experiences delivering the program. A research team member will meet twice&#xD;
      with a board-certified music therapist to determine bounds and flexibility for program&#xD;
      adaptation and determine standards to include in the best- practice guide to familiarize&#xD;
      adolescents to work with older adults with memory loss. (See: Pitfalls)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: The PI will coordinate interview times and conduct semi-structured, in-depth&#xD;
      interviews with the adolescent facilitators. Example questions will be &quot;Are there any&#xD;
      important ingredients missing from this intervention?&quot; Do each of the intervention's&#xD;
      ingredients have clarity when you imagine preparing a music class? What additional training&#xD;
      do you need to present to older adults with memory loss?&quot; The interviews will last&#xD;
      approximately 30-45 minutes and will take place immediately after the intervention training&#xD;
      session, as well as at the mid-point of delivering classes and following the conclusion of&#xD;
      the final class. They will be audio- and video-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A research&#xD;
      assistant will transcribe each interview, de- identifying any family caregiver information,&#xD;
      in a Microsoft Word document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Purposive sampling will be used to recruit an expert panel comprising of four&#xD;
      adolescent musicians. The inclusion criteria will be discussed in the Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
      section. Once identified, panelists will be contacted by a research assistant to share study&#xD;
      details and obtain consent. Participation in the interviews and facilitating the music&#xD;
      classes will be voluntary and musicians can withdraw from the study at any time. The PI will&#xD;
      coordinate interviews and facilitation times with the music facilitators. The musicians will&#xD;
      spend an estimated eight hours receiving the initial training, preparing for the classes,&#xD;
      facilitating the classes, and taking part in the interviews. Involvement for each musician&#xD;
      will take place over approximately two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management: Transcribed interview data will be uploaded and managed in the digital&#xD;
      qualitative analysis software, NVivo. These data will be securely stored on a hard drive&#xD;
      designated for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis and Dependability: The PI will follow a standard content analysis approach.&#xD;
      This analytic approach helps researchers identify categories and patterns in transcribed data&#xD;
      in a deductive manner. We will derive and systematically apply coding rules that are based on&#xD;
      perceptions and feedback regarding each music intervention ingredient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI will create this coding structure in NVivo and then conduct a meeting with the CO-I&#xD;
      (Rodakowski). During this session, researchers' ability to agree on coding of data will be&#xD;
      assessed and coding with which they encountered difficulty will be discussed. Twenty-percent&#xD;
      of the data will be independently coded by the two researchers. To measure intercoder&#xD;
      reliability, the PI will use the coding comparison query function in NVivo. A threshold will&#xD;
      be set at 80% agreement based on suggested values of intercoder reliability. Both researchers&#xD;
      will discuss disagreements and continue to code independently until this threshold is&#xD;
      reached. After which, the PI will finish the remaining data coding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome: Interview data with music facilitators will consist of information about&#xD;
      the feasibility of other adolescent music facilitators to implement the music program in&#xD;
      regards to each intervention ingredient. These findings will help the researchers making any&#xD;
      necessary adaptations to the intervention and update training for future music facilitators&#xD;
      prior to progressing to Aim 2, which will assess if the music program can be delivered with&#xD;
      fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential pitfalls: One potential pitfall is the lack of experience that the adolescent&#xD;
      facilitators may have with older adults with memory loss. To assist in their comfort, the PI&#xD;
      will develop a best-practice guide with the music therapist that anticipates some of the&#xD;
      issues when working with this population and provides suggestions of best practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess if the young musicians can deliver the music program with fidelity using&#xD;
      quantitative methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial development: A fidelity review form will be generated by the study team based on the&#xD;
      adaptations to the digital music program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: The PI will assess video recordings of the digital music classes and rate&#xD;
      them for fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The PI will work with community youth music programs to purposively sample 15&#xD;
      adolescent music facilitators. Convenience sampling will be employed to recruit 30 older&#xD;
      adult participants from community wellness programs. The inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be discussed in the Eligibility Criteria section. Once identified, facilitators and&#xD;
      participants will be contacted by a research assistant to share study details and obtain&#xD;
      consent. Participation in the music classes will be voluntary and musicians and participants&#xD;
      can withdraw from the study at any time. The PI will coordinate facilitation times with the&#xD;
      participants and the music facilitators. The facilitators will spend an estimated seven hours&#xD;
      each, which include a training session, preparation for the classes and facilitation of the&#xD;
      classes. Involvement for each musician will take place approximately one month. The&#xD;
      participants will spend an estimated 45 hours attending digital music classes. The&#xD;
      involvement for participants will take place approximately over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management: Fidelity review forms will be entered into RedCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis and Reliability: Within Microsoft Excel, the PI will calculate the fidelity&#xD;
      rates for each music facilitator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome: Fidelity rates will demonstrate if the music facilitators can deliver the&#xD;
      music intervention consistently. These findings will help the researchers making any&#xD;
      necessary adaptations to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential pitfalls: One potential pitfall is the adolescent music facilitators experiencing&#xD;
      uncertainty during the process of facilitation due to their lack of experience teaching and&#xD;
      presenting. To mitigate this uncertainty, a training session will be offered prior to the&#xD;
      facilitation sessions a professional music facilitator will be present for each session to&#xD;
      assist with unforeseen circumstances or to help navigate any difficult discussions that may&#xD;
      arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Assess if the program is appropriate for both the young musicians and the older adult&#xD;
      participants using qualitative methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial development: Focus group questions will be generated by the study team based on the&#xD;
      observations of the digital music program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The PI will work with community youth music programs to purposively sample 15&#xD;
      adolescent music facilitators. Convenience sampling will be employed to recruit 30&#xD;
      participants from community wellness programs that serve older adults. The inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be discussed in the Eligibility Criteria section. Once identified,&#xD;
      facilitators and participants will be contacted by a research assistant to share study&#xD;
      details and obtain consent. Participation in the focus groups will be voluntary and musicians&#xD;
      and participants can withdraw from the study at any time. The PI will coordinate focus group&#xD;
      times with the participants and the music facilitators. The focus groups will last&#xD;
      approximately 30-45 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Once consent is obtained and dates and times are confirmed, an appropriate&#xD;
      venue that is free from interruptions will be reserved to conduct focus groups. The PI will&#xD;
      follow a semi-structured guide to conduct one focus group with facilitator and another focus&#xD;
      group with participants. The semi-structured guide will ask both groups about practical&#xD;
      considerations such as the structure and technological features (volume level, font size in&#xD;
      presentations) of the music classes. Probing questions will be asked about appropriateness of&#xD;
      the classes delivered by the adolescent facilitators, opportunities that should be considered&#xD;
      in future iterations of the intervention, and potential skills learned or supported for&#xD;
      facilitators and participants. Focus groups will last approximately 30-45 minutes and will be&#xD;
      audio and video recorded. A research assistant will transcribe each focus group verbatim,&#xD;
      deidentifying any personal information, in a Microsoft Word document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management: Transcribed focus group data will be uploaded and managed in NVivo. These&#xD;
      data will be securely stored on a hard drive designated for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis and Dependability: The PI (Dorris) and Co-Investigator (Rodakowski) will&#xD;
      complete content analysis of the focus group data within NVivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcome: Mechanisms for administering and interpreting the music program will be&#xD;
      discussed and barriers and facilitators for future growth of the program will be collected.&#xD;
      Increasing our understanding of what was appropriate and what needs future adaptation will&#xD;
      lead to a more successful iteration of the intervention's development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Pitfalls: One potential logistical pitfall is the recruitment of adolescent&#xD;
      facilitators to participate in focus groups given their demanding schedules and availability.&#xD;
      If facilitators are unable to attend the focus group but are willing to participate in the&#xD;
      study, we will offer the opportunity to partake in individual interviews or complete an&#xD;
      online survey in place of the focus group. Another potential logistical pitfall is the memory&#xD;
      of the participants causing barriers to remembering the music classes. The research team will&#xD;
      coordinate with the participants of the music program to discuss breaking the focus group&#xD;
      questions into 5-10 minute sessions at the end of each facilitated class.&#xD;
