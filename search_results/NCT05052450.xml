  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia; It is a chronic syndrome characterized by a general and progressive deterioration&#xD;
      in cognition, including memory, orientation, language, and comprehension. The prognosis of&#xD;
      this progressive and neurodegenerative disease after diagnosis may differ between&#xD;
      individuals. In its broadest sense, the prognosis after a diagnosis of dementia; can be&#xD;
      defined by shortening of life span, high level of cognitive and functional loss, decrease in&#xD;
      quality of life and increased need for care. However, the prognosis of different types of&#xD;
      dementia is highly variable. Because it is the most common type of dementia, studies are&#xD;
      usually on Alzheimer's disease. It constitutes 50-75% of total dementia cases. Vascular&#xD;
      dementia is the second most common cause of dementia and accounts for approximately 15% of&#xD;
      dementia cases. Dementia with Lewy bodies constitutes 10-20% of the total dementia patients&#xD;
      and ranks second among degenerative dementia types. Frontotemporal dementia, which mimics&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders and has prominent behavioural problems, and Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease-associated dementia, which is characterized by cognitive impairment that can be added&#xD;
      to the existing picture in Parkinson's patients, are also counted among other types of&#xD;
      dementia. Prognosis-related data on dementia types other than Alzheimer's disease are limited&#xD;
      in the literature. Determining the prognosis is important to support patients, anticipate&#xD;
      long-term health problems, plan physician and healthcare provision, and support patients with&#xD;
      dementia.In view of the lack of sufficient data on dementia types other than Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, it is aimed to contribute to the literature on this subject and to determine the&#xD;
      factors that may affect prognosis, morbidity and mortality in patients belonging to all&#xD;
      dementia types.&#xD;

    <description>It was performed to assess mental status. It gives an overall opinion on cognitive domains and tests orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. Total scores on Mini-Mental State Examination range from 0 to 30, higher scores show better cognitive performance.</description>

    <description>It was used for assessing physical functioning as a part of the routine geriatric evaluation.where the ten performance items used. Those items defined as feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, continence of bowel and bladder, toilet use, transfers (bed to chair and back), mobility (on level surfaces), and climbing stairs. Each item is scored on this scale, and the sum is obtained by adding the score of each item (range, 0-100; higher scores show better performance)</description>
