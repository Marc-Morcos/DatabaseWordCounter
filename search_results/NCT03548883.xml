  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a poorly understood pathology. It&#xD;
      is an irreversible progressive brain disease that slowly deteriorates memory, thinking and&#xD;
      behavior. It affects the elderly population and is also hereditary. The incidence doubles&#xD;
      with every decade after sixty with no signs of leveling off. More than 35 million people&#xD;
      Worldwide, including 5.5 million living in the United States, suffer from AD. As the United&#xD;
      States population ages, it is expected that the number of people with AD will increase,&#xD;
      reaching 13.2 to 16.0 million by the year 2050. The cost of care for patients with AD in the&#xD;
      United States is expected to rise as well, from $172 billion a year in 2010 to a trillion&#xD;
      dollars a year by 2050.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the exact etiopathology is not known there are several lines of evidence that&#xD;
      suggest that metabolic and inflammatory features are important. It also has been known for&#xD;
      many years that the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) of Alzheimer's patients allow more harmful&#xD;
      particles to cross into the brain than the BBBs of those without the disease do. It's known&#xD;
      that this barrier, which is regulating transfer of molecules between the brain and blood, and&#xD;
      vice versa blood and brain, can become leaky and dysfunctional (in particular capillaries&#xD;
      dysfunction) and lead to subsequent problems likely contributing to onset and progression of&#xD;
      dementia. This protocol will explore several of the most promising putative factors that&#xD;
      cause AD.&#xD;

        Due to the target study population, patients with AD, it is expected that the subjects will&#xD;
        have cognitive impairments. The objectives of this study cannot be met with research only&#xD;
        involving subjects who can personally give consent. Patients with AD who have cognitive&#xD;
        impairments would have to be included in this study in order for us to accurately study the&#xD;
        disease. For this study, a score of 24 or below on the Mini Mental Status Examination&#xD;
        (MMSE), will indicate cognitive impairment. In these cases, we will get written consent&#xD;
        from the legally authorized representative (LAR).&#xD;
