  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a once daily&#xD;
      controlled-release form of galantamine (a drug for treating dementia) versus placebo in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a chronic, progressive brain disease that may involve a number of symptoms,&#xD;
      including memory loss and changes in personality, behavior, judgment, attention span,&#xD;
      language and thought. The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Over time,&#xD;
      patients with Alzheimer's disease may lose the ability to perform daily tasks related to&#xD;
      personal care (for example, bathing, dressing, and eating) and may be unable to handle money&#xD;
      or travel to familiar places. Previous clinical trials have shown that a twice-daily dose of&#xD;
      galantamine (18 - 32 mg/day) improved symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. This multicenter,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of a&#xD;
      controlled-release form of galantamine in patients with Alzheimer's disease. All patients&#xD;
      receive placebo during the first month of the study. Patients then receive controlled-release&#xD;
      galantamine (8 - 24 mg once daily), or immediate-release galantamine (4 - 12 mg twice daily)&#xD;
      or placebo for 6 months. The dose of galantamine starts at 8 mg/day and may be increased up&#xD;
      to 24 mg/day, if needed. The dose may be adjusted up or down during the first 12 weeks of&#xD;
      double-blind treatment based upon effectiveness and tolerability. Patients continue to&#xD;
      receive the dose they are taking at the end of 12 weeks for the remainder of the study. The&#xD;
      primary measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline to the end of treatment in&#xD;
      the ADAS-cog/11 (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale: sum of 11 cognitive items) and&#xD;
      CIBIC-plus (Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change - Plus Caregiver Input) scores.&#xD;
      Additional measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline in the Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) and the Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Inventory (NPI) scores. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, electrocardiograms&#xD;
      (ECGs), physical examinations, laboratory tests) are performed throughout the study. Patients&#xD;
      who complete the double-blind portion of the study have the opportunity to receive&#xD;
      galantamine in an open-label follow-up study. Patients may also participate in an optional&#xD;
      portion of the study in which their genetic material is analyzed to see if contains something&#xD;
      that would affect the way galantamine is used by their bodies. The study hypothesis is that&#xD;
      treatment with controlled-release galantamine is effective in improving the symptoms of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and is well tolerated. Controlled-release galantamine 8 - 24 mg by mouth&#xD;
      once daily, or immediate-release galantamine 4 - 12 mg by mouth twice daily, or placebo.&#xD;
      Dosing starts at 8 mg/day and may be increased up to 24 mg/day, if needed. The study duration&#xD;
      is 6 months.&#xD;
