      This is a multi-center, Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group&#xD;
      trial in adults with mild to moderate AD. The primary endpoint is the change from the&#xD;
      baseline CSF Amyloid beta oligomer concentration after dosing with CT1812 versus placebo. The&#xD;
      change from baseline will be measured through a number of exploratory endpoints as indicated&#xD;
      below. For each subject, the baseline CSF oligomer concentration will be computed as the&#xD;
      average of the measurements from hours -4, -3, -2 and -1 and 0.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men, and women of non-childbearing potential, 50-85 years of age inclusively, with a&#xD;
             diagnosis of mild to moderate Probable Alzheimer's Disease Dementia according to the&#xD;
             2011 NIA-AA criteria and at least a 6 month decline in cognitive function documented&#xD;
             in the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. a. Non-childbearing potential for women is defined as postmenopausal [last&#xD;
                  natural menses greater than 24 months; in women under age 55, menopausal status&#xD;
                  will be documented with serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) test] or&#xD;
                  undergone a documented bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. b. Male participants who are sexually active with a woman of childbearing&#xD;
                  potential must agree to use condoms during the trial unless the woman is using an&#xD;
                  acceptable means of birth control. Acceptable forms of birth control include&#xD;
                  abstinence, birth control pills, or any double combination of: intrauterine&#xD;
                  device (IUD), male or female condom, diaphragm, sponge, and cervical cap.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Neuromaging (MRI) obtained during screening consistent with the clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
             Alzheimer's disease and without findings of significant exclusionary abnormalities&#xD;
             (see exclusion criteria, number 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. MMSE 18-26 inclusive. Subjects must, in the opinion of the investigator, be able to&#xD;
             comply with study procedures and must understand the consent process. The investigator&#xD;
             will use his or her clinical judgment in conjunction with the cognitive screening&#xD;
             assessments to determine whether the subject meets these criteria in a manner that is&#xD;
             consistent with local clinical practice and standards. Subjects with borderline low&#xD;
             MMSE at screening may undergo repeat MMSE administration if extenuating circumstances&#xD;
             were present at original assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A positive amyloid scan (florbetaben F18, florbetapir F18, or flutametamol F18) at&#xD;
             screening or within prior 12 months, as read by the certified, site-designated PET&#xD;
             scan reader.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Must consent to apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must have a caregiver or study partner who can participate in all clinic&#xD;
             visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients living at home or in the community (assisted living acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Able to swallow CT1812 capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Stable pharmacological treatment of any other chronic conditions for at least 30 days&#xD;
             prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects must be capable of providing either written informed consent to the study&#xD;
             procedures and for use of protected health information [Health Insurance Portability&#xD;
             and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Authorization, if applicable]. Written informed consent&#xD;
             also shall be obtained from the responsible caregiver or study partner. All consent&#xD;
             processes must be undertaken in the presence of a witness and prior to any study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects shall be generally healthy with mobility (ambulatory or ambulatory-aided,&#xD;
             i.e., walker or cane), vision and hearing (hearing aid permissible) sufficient for&#xD;
             compliance with testing procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Must be able to complete all screening evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Hospitalization or change of chronic concomitant medication within one month prior to&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients living in a continuous care nursing facility&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Screening MRI of the brain indicative of significant abnormality, including, but not&#xD;

             contusion, encephalomalacia, aneurysm, vascular malformation, subdural hematoma,&#xD;
             hydrocephalus, space-occupying lesion (e.g. abscess or brain tumor such as&#xD;
             meningioma). If a small incidental meningioma is observed, the medical monitor may be&#xD;
             contacted to discuss eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinical or laboratory findings consistent with:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  should be discussed with medical monitor to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A current DSM-V diagnosis that would interfere with the subject's ability to&#xD;
             participate in the study. Patients with depressive symptoms successfully managed by a&#xD;
             stable dose of an antidepressant are allowed entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any prior history of suicidal thoughts or behavior that are believed by the&#xD;
             investigator to represent a current safety risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Clinically significant, advanced or unstable disease that may interfere with outcome&#xD;
             evaluations, such as:&#xD;

                  disease (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, cardiomyopathy&#xD;
                  within six months before screening). If a subject has a history of heart disease&#xD;
                  of questionable clinical significance, the medical monitor may be contacted to&#xD;
                  discuss eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Bradycardia (&lt;50 beats/min.) or tachycardia (&gt;100 beats/min.). Otherwise healthy&#xD;
                  subjects with borderline bradycardia may be discussed with the medical monitor to&#xD;
                  determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;

             sedatives, opioids, mood stabilizers (e.g., valproate, lithium); or benzodiazepines,&#xD;
             with the following exceptions:&#xD;

                  testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. administration of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) may be&#xD;
