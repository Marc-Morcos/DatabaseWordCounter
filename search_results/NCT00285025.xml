  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that SR57667B at the dose of 4 mg/day, in comparison&#xD;
      to placebo, decreases the decline in cognitive performance and the global clinical decline&#xD;
      over 1 year in patients with mild to moderate AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to assess the effect of SR57667B on functional decline and its&#xD;
      safety/tolerability in patients with mild to moderate AD, and to document plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of SR57667 in patients with mild to moderate AD.&#xD;
