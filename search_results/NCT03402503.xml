      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility, tolerability and efficacy of a&#xD;
      new buccal film of montelukast in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized Phase IIa, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a new&#xD;
      buccal film of montelukast in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. Study drug&#xD;
      (montelukast or matching placebo) will be administered once or twice daily for 26 weeks, and&#xD;
      treatment effect will be assessed primarily using the global NTB composite score at Week 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consent to participate will undergo screening assessments to determine&#xD;
      eligibility. This study will enroll patients who are ≥50 years of age with mild to moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease and on a stable treatment of donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine for&#xD;
      ≥3 months. Patients will be randomized (using a balanced block randomization schedule) to one&#xD;
      of two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Montelukast buccal film&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Matching placebo buccal film&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the global NTB composite, patients will also be evaluated using the MMSE,&#xD;
      ADCS-CGIC, ADCS-ADL23, NPI and S-STS. Patients will be followed for any safety concerns&#xD;
      throughout the study and for 4 weeks following the last study visit.&#xD;

    <time_frame>To be conducted at Visit 2 (Baseline), Visit 4 (Week 6), Visit 6 (Week 12) and Visit 8 (Week 26)</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate if treatment with montelukast new buccal film is superior to placebo, assessed at Week 26 using the global NTB composite score. The NTB score will be used to assess cognitive and behavioral functions including problem-solving and conceptualization. The composite score will be based on an equally weighted average of standardized change from baseline scores on the following tests: International Shopping List Test (ISLT), ISLT-Delay, One Back Test, One Card Learning Test, Verbal Fluency Test, Category Fluency Test, Identification Test and Detection Test.</description>

    <description>Evaluate whether 26 weeks of treatment with montelukast improved scores using the MMSE. The MMSE will be used to assess the subject's mental status in terms of cognitive function and level of dementia. The MMSE test will consist of an 11-question measure that will test five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score is 30.</description>

    <description>Evaluate whether 26 weeks of treatment with montelukast improved scores using the ADCS-CGIC. ADCS-CGIC assessment and rating will be based on investigator's observation of changes in the subject's cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of a clinical trial (baseline) until end of treatment (Week 8).</description>

    <time_frame>To be conducted at Visit 2 (Baseline) and Visit 8 (Week 26)</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate whether 26 weeks of treatment with montelukast improves the behavioral disturbance in patients, measured by the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), compared to placebo. NPI is an assessment of the frequency and severity of behavioral disturbances in dementia. The inventory comprises 10 behavioural areas: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behaviour; and 2 neurovegetative areas. Each area has a screening question between 7 and 9 follow-up questions relating to symptoms, asked if the answer to the screening question was 'yes'. Ratings will be based on frequency, severity and distress on identified behaviours. The change from Baseline and at 26 week treatment will be measured.</description>
