  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is associated with a variety of neurovascular and neurometabolic abnormalities.&#xD;
      Traditional imaging techniques used to investigate such abnormalities, such as Positron&#xD;
      Emission Tomography and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, are not always well tolerated,&#xD;
      have expensive start up and running costs, and are limited with regards to the types of&#xD;
      experiments that can be performed as they can be highly sensitive to movement, are noisy, and&#xD;
      have physical restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique which uses light&#xD;
      in the near-infrared spectrum to detect relative changes in concentration of oxygenated and&#xD;
      deoxygenated haemoglobin, and the oxidation state of Cytochrome C Oxidase. As such, NIRS can&#xD;
      provide measures of brain oxygenation and metabolism. NIRS is less sensitive to movement, is&#xD;
      well tolerated and has few contraindications. It is thus a promising candidate for use in&#xD;
      clinics or in peoples' homes for monitoring dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators aim to use both dual-wavelength and broadband NIRS in&#xD;
      a range of dementia subtypes, including Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies,&#xD;
      and severities, including Mild Cognitive Impairment, to identify how brain oxygenation and&#xD;
      metabolism is altered in dementia and across various clinical subgroups. The investigators&#xD;
      also aim to determine the relationship between brain oxygenation and metabolism in dementia,&#xD;
      and use machine learning approaches to identify optical biomarkers for dementia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several different types of dementia including Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Dementia&#xD;
      with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Due to the overlapping symptomatology across types of dementia and&#xD;
      the lack of objective biomarkers currently available for dementia, misdiagnosis rates are&#xD;
      high. Additionally, the transition from what is commonly thought to be an intermediate stage,&#xD;
      termed Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), to dementia, is not well defined. Neurovascular and&#xD;
      metabolic dysfunction has been strongly linked to neurodegeneration and dementia, however, a&#xD;
      mechanistic understanding of this link has not been fully developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive, non-ionising and portable neuroimaging&#xD;
      technique which uses light to quantify changes in concentration of oxygenated and&#xD;
      deoxygenated haemoglobin in the brain. As such, it is a highly attractive alternative to&#xD;
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging as it allows access to a larger variety of individuals,&#xD;
      can be used at the bedside or in patients' own homes, and is significantly less intrusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify how the brain's haemodynamics and metabolism is altered in dementia, this study&#xD;
      will use NIRS in 25 patients with AD, 25 patients with DLB, 50 patients with MCI and 100&#xD;
      age-matched healthy controls. This study will be conducted by the School of Technology and&#xD;
      the School of Clinical Medicine at the University of Cambridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, the investigators will perform several cognitive tests in these patient groups&#xD;
      whilst measuring brain activity using a state-of-the-art, dual-wavelength, high-density NIRS&#xD;
      device to map how the brain's haemodynamics are altered in dementia. Secondly, the&#xD;
      investigators will perform further cognitive tests using broadband NIRS to measure how&#xD;
      neurometabolism is altered across the patient groups. The investigators will also relate the&#xD;
      optical data to several facets of cognition that these cognitive tests will measure including&#xD;
      memory, attention, and motor function. Several questionnaires will also be administered to&#xD;
      assess non-cognitive symptoms such as depression and sleep disturbances. If participants in&#xD;
      the patient groups have not had a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan, or did one over two&#xD;
      years ago, they will also undertake an MRI scan to enable the localisation of brain activity,&#xD;
      measured by NIRS, accounting for individual differences in brain structure and atrophy&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators shall compare all patient groups (AD, DLB, MCI) with healthy controls to&#xD;
      determine how the brain's haemodynamics and metabolism are altered in dementia, as well as&#xD;
      how this relates to both behavioural scores (collected during cognitive testing) and clinical&#xD;
      scores (using either data collected from questionnaires or patient's own clinical history).&#xD;
      Through combining the two NIRS techniques, the investigators shall also determine the nature&#xD;
      of the relationship between the blood oxygenation in the surrounding vasculature and the&#xD;
      intra-neuronal metabolic activity, and how this relationship may be altered in dementia and&#xD;
      across different types of dementia. Additionally, the investigators shall apply computational&#xD;
      methods, such as machine learning, to identify haemodynamic and/or metabolic signatures for&#xD;
      use as biomarkers in the clinic.&#xD;
