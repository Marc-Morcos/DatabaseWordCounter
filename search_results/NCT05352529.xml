  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigated a six-week randomized controlled trial study in a small cohort of 16&#xD;
      family caregivers of individuals living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.&#xD;
      Family caregivers used assistive technology in the form of visual mapping software on smart&#xD;
      devices in the experimental condition to support their care recipients in carrying out&#xD;
      activities of daily living. Family caregivers in the control condition viewed educational&#xD;
      videos about dementia care on their devices in supporting their individuals. The intervention&#xD;
      was implemented for a total of 6 weeks. The investigators hypothesized that compared to the&#xD;
      caregivers using educational videos, the caregivers using assistive technology will report&#xD;
      improved quality of life and completion of activities of daily living for their care&#xD;
      recipients, all the while reducing caregiver's burden and stress.&#xD;

    <time_frame>The instrument was administered to the participants after the completion of the study duration (6-week study</time_frame>
    <description>18-item quality-of-life questionnaire (QoL-18) evaluated a range of participants' behaviors, including mood, engagement, and memory at the end of the study compared to before the use of the MHS. The instrument is scored on a Likert Scale, ranging from 1-5. A higher number indicates better outcome.</description>

The MapHabit System (MHS) is a commercially available visual mapping software application that utilize visual, audio, and text media to create step-by-step visual guides to assist individuals and their caregivers in structuring and accomplishing activities of daily living (ADLs). The application was made available to families through compatible tablets.</description>

    <description>The MapHabit System (MHS) is a commercially available visual mapping software application that utilize visual, audio, and text media to create step-by-step visual guides to assist individuals and their caregivers in structuring and accomplishing activities of daily living (ADLs). The goal of the application is to develop and facilitate habits and routines using structured visual and auditory stimuli that can be customized by the user and can include educational and lesson-based material in addition to ADLs. The application was made available to families through compatible smartphones and tablets.&#xD;
The MHS is a general wellness product and there is no regulatory oversight of the MapHabit System mapping functionality. This functionality is not a regulated medical device.</description>
