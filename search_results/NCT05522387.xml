    <textblock>
      The goal of this Phase 2 Open-Label Extension (OLE) is to evaluate long-term safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy of XPro1595 on measures of cognition, function and brain quality&#xD;
      in individuals with mild Alzheimer's Disease or MCI with biomarkers of inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a Phase 2, open-label study investigating the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and efficacy of XPro1595 in patients with Mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (MCI). The planned dose is 1.0 mg/kg of XPro1595 for all subjects that completed a&#xD;
      previous Phase 2 study with XPro1595.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two Phase 2 Studies that were previously set up, whose participants can&#xD;
      subsequently join this OLE study. One Phase 2 Study (NCT05318976) is a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study where 201 (anticipated) participants receive&#xD;
      XPro1595 and placebo (2:1 ratio) for 6 months (Week 1 to Week 24). This study targets&#xD;
      patients with mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Participants who received the drug during this&#xD;
      study, and subsequently join the OLE study, will be on XPro1595 for an additional 12 months&#xD;
      (52 weeks). Their total exposure to XPro1595 will be up to 18 months (76 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other Phase 2 Study (NCT05321498) is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind&#xD;
      clinical study where 60 (anticipated) participants receive XPro1595 and placebo (2:1 ratio)&#xD;
      for 3 months (Week 1 to Week 12). This study targets patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment&#xD;
      (MCI). Participants who received the drug during this study, and subsequently join the OLE&#xD;
      study, will be on XPro1595 for an additional 15 months (64 weeks). Their total exposure to&#xD;
      XPro1595 will be up to 18 months (76 weeks).&#xD;

The NPI-12 total score is calculated by adding the scores of the domains (each domain score ranges from 0 to 12). The NPI-12 total score is based upon the first 10 items and ranges from (0 to 10) with higher scores indicating greater behavioral impairment.</description>

The 23-item Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Mild Cognitive Impairment Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-MCI-ADL) Scale has good test-retest reliability, will be utilized to assess performance functioning in MCI patients (Galasko et al., 1997; Douglas Galasko et al., 2006; Pedrosa et al., 2010). The ADCS-ADL includes 18 items from traditional basic ADL scales and 5 items from instrumental activities of daily living scales (IADL) The possible range of total scores for the ADL Scale is 0-53 and higher scores indicate better functioning. The internal reliability was .91( Galasko et al., 1997; Douglas Galasko et al., 2006; Pedrosa et al., 2010).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are eligible to be included in the study only if all the following criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participated and completed the full duration of the study intervention and all&#xD;
             procedures at the End of Study (EOS) visit in a previous XPro1595 Phase 2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Concomitant medications for the management MCI/AD and/or behavior symptoms which were&#xD;
             ongoing during the double-blind study should remain at a constant dose throughout this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must be willing and able to provide informed consent prior to any study&#xD;
             procedures being performed. If the patient is not competent, a LAR (Legally Authorized&#xD;
             Representative) must provide informed consent on their behalf, and the patient must&#xD;
             provide assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has a study partner willing to participate for the duration of the trial who either&#xD;
             lives in the same household or interacts with the patient at least 4 hours per day and&#xD;
             on at least 4 days per week, who is knowledgeable about the patient's daytime and&#xD;
             night-time behaviors and who can be available to attend all clinic visits in person at&#xD;
             which informant assessments are performed. This study partner should agree to monitor&#xD;
             and report on concomitant medications, understand the study requirements, and assist&#xD;
             the participant in meeting study requirements. Patients with study partners that do&#xD;
             not meet this criterion but are determined by the investigator as able to provide an&#xD;
             adequate assessment of the patient may also participate with prior approval from the&#xD;
             sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Male contraception - Agree to use a male condom with female partner use of an&#xD;
             additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A female participant who is a woman of child-bearing potential (WOBCP) must have a&#xD;
             negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine) as required by local regulations&#xD;
             within 24 hours before the first dose of study intervention, see Section 7.3.6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any clinically significant abnormalities that in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             require further investigation or treatment or may interfere with study procedures and&#xD;
             assessments or affect patient safety. These include but are not limited to, laboratory&#xD;
             tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, or vital signs at Screening or&#xD;
             other medical conditions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, psychiatric,&#xD;
             renal disease) which are not adequately and stably controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unable to comply with the study procedures and assessments.&#xD;
