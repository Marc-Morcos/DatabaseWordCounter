  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the demographical development, age-related diseases will drastically increase over the&#xD;
      next decades. To face this healthcare challenge, early and accurate identification of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment is crucial. The assessment of neurocognitive functioning ideally&#xD;
      requires a tool that is short, easy to administer and interpret, and has high diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy. In this context, the use of computerized test batteries is receiving increasing&#xD;
      attention. Compared to paper-pencil tests, computerized test batteries have many advantages.&#xD;
      The possibility to measure reaction times may provide additional information. Moreover, test&#xD;
      questions are always presented the exact same way, examiner-related bias is eliminated, and&#xD;
      results are available immediately after examination. Due to the ability to adjust the level&#xD;
      of difficulty to the performance of the individual, floor and ceiling effects may be&#xD;
      minimized. Additionally, costs are reduced, and fewer materials and less trained personnel&#xD;
      are required. Finally, big data approaches and the use of machine learning algorithms are&#xD;
      becoming more popular in the field of clinical diagnostics, and computerized cognitive test&#xD;
      batteries may facilitate future data collection to this aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014, we developed a self-administered tablet computer program for the iPad (CogCheck) to&#xD;
      assess preoperative cognitive functioning in surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive tests used in the CogCheck application are identical or similar to the&#xD;
      paper-and-pencil tests that are currently used in dementia diagnostics. Replacing some of the&#xD;
      paper-and-pencil tests by a computerized test battery may facilitate the routine&#xD;
      neuropsychological examinations. Thus, we aim to investigate the diagnostic accuracy and&#xD;
      user-friendliness of CogCheck when applied in a cognitively impaired patient sample. In a&#xD;
      first step, the diagnostic properties of CogCheck will be examined by differentiating between&#xD;
      healthy controls and patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) predominantly&#xD;
      due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data from healthy controls have been collected (EKNZ&#xD;
      Req-2016-00393) in a previous normative study of CogCheck. Thus a further aim is to&#xD;
      investigate the user-friendliness of CogCheck in patients with mild or major NCD&#xD;
      predominantly due to AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of our study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of CogCheck for&#xD;
      patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD in a German-speaking population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are: (1) to examine the user-friendliness of CogCheck in patients with mild or&#xD;
      major NCD predominantly due to AD, (2) to compare the results between cognitively healthy&#xD;
      individuals (EKNZ Req-2016-00393) and patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD&#xD;
      on each of the CogCheck subtest, (3) to establish an algorithm with the CogCheck subtests&#xD;
      that optimally distinguishes between cognitively healthy controls (EKNZ Req-2016-00393) and&#xD;
      patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD, (4) to compare the diagnostic&#xD;
      properties of CogCheck with the ones of the currently used paper-pencil tests.&#xD;
