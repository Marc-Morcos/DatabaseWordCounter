      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female subjects between 50 and 80 years(inclusive) of age at the time of&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects capable of providing valid independent informed consent and signing the&#xD;
             informed consent form (the subjects' capacity to provide valid consent should be&#xD;
             determined in accordance with applicable professional standards, and will be based on&#xD;
             the Investigator's judgement)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with mild cognitive impairment(MCI) due to AD or mild AD according to&#xD;
             National Institute of Aging -Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) core clinical criteria;&#xD;
             subjects must have all of the following at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Clinical dementia rating(CDR) global score(GS) of 0.5 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. CDR memory score of ≥0.5c. Mini mental state examination(MMSE) score of ≥20&#xD;
                  points&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Screening cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) results showing a pattern consistent with amyloid&#xD;
             plaque load and indicative of AD pathology. The CSF results will be evaluated by the&#xD;
             Investigator and will take into account the Aβ42/40ratio (cut-off level set by the&#xD;
             laboratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If the subject is receiving an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor (AChEI)or memantine or&#xD;
             both for the treatment of MCI or AD, this treatment must be on a stable dosage for at&#xD;
             least 8 weeks prior to the first dosing of investigational medicinal product(IMP).&#xD;
             Treatment-naïve subjects may also be entered into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must have an identified, reliable and knowledgeable study partner who is&#xD;
             willing and able to support the participant and to provide follow-up information on&#xD;
             the study participant throughout the course of the study. This person must, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, spend sufficient time with the study participant on a&#xD;
             regular basis such that he or she can reliably fulfil the requirements of being a&#xD;
             study partner (however, a study partner does not need to be living in the same&#xD;
             household with the study participant)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects having any contraindication to MRI scanning; or are unable to undergo brain&#xD;
             MRI scanning according to the standard criteria of the MRI unit;or the Investigator&#xD;
             believes that the subject will not be able to undergo further scans scheduled during&#xD;
             the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Screening MRI(3T)results showing evidence of clinically significant pathological&#xD;
             lesions that could indicate a dementia-associated diagnosis other than early AD or&#xD;
             cause a safety risk for the participant(a list of possible exclusionary findings is&#xD;
             included in the main protocol text)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Modified Hachinski Ischemia Score (mHIS) &gt;4 at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of a cerebrovascular incident, including transient ischemic attack(TIA) or&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Subject with a history of seizures within 5 years of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any psychiatric diagnosis or symptoms (e.g.hallucinations, major depression,&#xD;
             delusions, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) that, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             could interfere with study procedures or assessments or participant safety. A subject&#xD;
             with depression may, however, be included if treated with a stable dose of&#xD;
             antidepressants for at least 8 weeks before screening and not fulfilling Diagnostic&#xD;
             and Statistical Manual(DSM)-5 criteria for major depression at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Significant risk of suicide (defined using the Columbia Suicide Severity&#xD;
             Scale(C-SSRS), with the subject answering &quot;yes&quot; to suicidal ideation questions 4 or 5&#xD;
             or answering &quot;yes&quot; to suicidal behaviour) within 12 months of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Disorder related to alcohol or drug abuse, as defined in DSM-5, within 5 years prior&#xD;
             to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Evidence of current or history of any significant autoimmune disease that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, could interfere with evaluation of the study results or&#xD;
             constitute a health hazard for the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Evidence of an immune system that is compromised; including, but not limited to, a&#xD;
             diagnosis of HIV(human immunodeficiency virus); or the subject has been splenectomised&#xD;

             chronic systemic immunosuppressive medication&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Evidence of current clinically significant and possibly unstable pulmonary,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine, hematological or cardiovascular system&#xD;
             disease or metabolic disturbance&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Diagnosis of cancer (hematological or solid tumor) for which the subject is currently&#xD;
             being treated, or for which there has been treatment within 5 years preceding&#xD;
             screening, or for which there is still evidence of active disease. Subjects with local&#xD;
             prostate cancer or local dermatological tumors, such as basal or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma, may be included&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG or&#xD;
             physical examination findings at screening that in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             require further investigation or treatment, or may interfere with study procedures or&#xD;
             safety. These may include, but are not limited to, the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. estimated glomerular filtration ratio (eGFR) &lt;30 ml/min/1.73m2, based on the&#xD;
                  Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration(CKD-EPI) equation&#xD;

               4. low vitamin B12 or folate values that are considered to be clinically significant&#xD;
                  in relation to cognitive impairment. In such cases, re-screening is permissible&#xD;
                  after supplementation therapy has been provided for a sufficient time&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. prolonged QT corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's cube root formula(QTcF)&#xD;
                  interval of &gt;470 ms&#xD;

             antibodies in CSF&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Contraindication to lumbar puncture (LP). These contraindications may include, but are&#xD;
             not limited to, the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. increased intracranial pressure (ICP)&#xD;

                  blood factor or thrombin inhibitor). Use of anti-platelet therapy(e.g. low-dose&#xD;
                  aspirin) may be permitted if deemed appropriate in the Investigator's judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Current or anticipated use,or recent prior use (pre-study time limits specified in the&#xD;
             main protocol text) of disallowed concomitant treatment&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. History of severe drug allergy (anaphylactic shock or drug-induced hypersensitivity&#xD;
             syndrome), or known hypersensitivity to vaccines, including constituents of vaccines&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. active anti-amyloid immunization or other active immunization for the treatment&#xD;
                  of AD&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. any other investigational medication (unless it can be documented that the&#xD;
                  subject received only placebo) or device within 3 months or 5 half-lives(which&#xD;
                  ever is longer) before screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Any condition that may be contributing to cognitive impairment above and beyond that&#xD;
             caused by the subject's early AD&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Disease or medication that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could interfere with&#xD;
             the assessments of safety, tolerability or immunogenicity&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Planned surgery requiring general, spinal or epidural anaesthesia that would take&#xD;
             place during the study. Planned surgery requiring only local anaesthesia need not&#xD;
             result in exclusion, if in the opinion of the Investigator this operation does not&#xD;
             interfere with study procedures and participant safety&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Female subjects of childbearing potential(defined in detail in the main protocol text)&#xD;
