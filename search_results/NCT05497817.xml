  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to develop a unique matching process for caregivers of persons&#xD;
      living with dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal&#xD;
      degeneration, or other dementia syndromes. Dementia caregivers often assume greater&#xD;
      caregiving burden than do non-dementia caregivers, and the caregiving duration tends to be&#xD;
      longer. Many caregivers do not have the adequate support they need. Peer-to-peer support has&#xD;
      been shown to improve quality of life, increase use of services, improve caregiver health,&#xD;
      and reduce hospitalizations in the person they are caring for. This study will assess a&#xD;
      technology platform and matching process for the purpose of peer-to-peer emotional support&#xD;
      aimed at improving overall wellbeing in dementia care partners/caregivers.&#xD;

             quarterly, and actively interacting with the website and potential matches.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must agree to follow-up contact throughout the duration of the study,&#xD;
