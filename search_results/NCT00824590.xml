    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the pharmacokinetics of Dimebon in subjects with severe renal&#xD;
      impairment to subjects with normal renal function after oral administration of a single oral&#xD;
      20-mg dose of Dimebon. This study is also to assess the safety and tolerability of a single&#xD;
      oral 20-mg dose of Dimebon in subjects with severe renal impairment and subjects with normal&#xD;
      renal function.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and/or female subjects between the ages of 18 and 75 years, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For severe renal impairment group, subjects with creatinine clearance of less than 30&#xD;
             mL/min, but not yet on dialysis and in good general health commensurate with the&#xD;
             population with chronic renal disease; however, subjects with type 1 and 2 diabetes&#xD;
             that are reasonably controlled and who do not have a predisposition to severe&#xD;
             hypoglycemia can both be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For normal renal function group, healthy subjects with creatinine clearance of greater&#xD;
             than 80mL/min and demographically comparable to subjects with impaired renal function&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women; women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who are unwilling&#xD;
             or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception as outlined in the protocol&#xD;
             from at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For normal renal function group, use of prescription or non-prescription drugs,&#xD;
             vitamins, or dietary supplements within 7 days of 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy must be discontinued 28 days prior to&#xD;
        the first dose of study medication. Acetaminophen at doses of â‰¤ 2 grams/day is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For renal impairment group, a known history of clinically significant coronary heart&#xD;
             disease, cerebrovascular disease or peripheral vascular disease and/or an&#xD;
             event/intervention during the past 6 months. Systemic therapy with CYP3A or CYP2D6&#xD;
             inhibitors within 7 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of trial medication.&#xD;
