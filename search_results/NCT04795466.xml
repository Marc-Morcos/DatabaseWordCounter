  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this platform study is to evaluate the effect of anti-inflammatory agents on&#xD;
      cognition in early Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the safety and tolerability of these&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents and the effects on central and peripheral inflammation will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, participant- and investigator-blinded study in&#xD;
      participants with either mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease with evidence&#xD;
      of peripheral inflammation. This study is using a platform design to be able to investigate&#xD;
      different agents (therapies) in a perpetual manner. Each unique investigational agent will&#xD;
      have a unique cohort of participants assigned. New cohorts of participants may be enrolled to&#xD;
      investigate additional agents at unspecified timepoints throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three periods in the study: screening period of 60 days that includes a baseline&#xD;
      period of 5 days, a treatment period (20 weeks) and a follow-up period (28 days) and an&#xD;
      additional follow-up visit for therapies with a longer washout.&#xD;

    <description>Positron-Emission Tomography-Translocator Protein 18kDa-microglia activation (PET TSPO) is considered a marker of central inflammation (a marker for activated microglia and astrocytes) and the signal strength has been shown to correlate with worsening clinical severity in participants with MCI or AD, measures of cognition and various clinical scores.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Everyday Cognition (eCog) scale measures cognitively-relevant everyday abilities and is comprised of 39 items covering six cognitively-relevant domains: Everyday Memory, Everyday Language, Everyday Visuospatial Abilities, Everyday Planning, Everyday Organization, and Everyday Divided Attention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in memory as measured by the total Neuropsychological Test Battery memory composite score and change from baseline in executive function as measured by the total Neuropsychological Test Battery executive function composite score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total Neuropsychological Test Battery memory composite score is a &quot;memory function&quot; composite score and is obtained by averaging the following z-scores from the NTB: RAVLT immediate and delayed scores. The total Neuropsychological Test Battery executive function composite score is an &quot;executive function&quot; composite score that is obtained by averaging the following three z-scores from the NTB: Wechsler Memory Scale Digit Span, COWAT, and CFT.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in pharmacokinetic concentrations and immunogenetic anti-agent antibody levels in serum and/or plasma and/or cerebrospinal fluid</measure>
