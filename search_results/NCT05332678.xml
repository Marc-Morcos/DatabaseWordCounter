      Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the treatment&#xD;
      effects and safety of SLS-005 in Participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) treated weekly&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study evaluating the&#xD;
      treatment effects and safety of SLS-005 (trehalose injection, 90.5 mg/mL for intravenous&#xD;
      infusion) in eligible men and women, ages 50-85 years, who have very mild, mild, or moderate&#xD;
      dementia as determined by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score and a&#xD;
      biomarker-supported diagnosis of AD guided by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Association (NIA-AA) Research Framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 40 eligible participants who will be randomized in a 3:1&#xD;
      ratio to treatment with either SLS-005 at a dose of 0.75 g/kg or equivalent placebo (sodium&#xD;
      chloride injection, 0.9%, USP) administered by intravenous (IV) infusion once every week for&#xD;
      up to 52 weeks. Participant randomization assignments will be stratified by baseline dementia&#xD;
      severity (i.e., mild (CDR 0.5 or 1), or moderate (CDR 2)) using a single fixed randomization&#xD;
      scheme with stratified, randomly permuted blocks. Relatively equal number of enrolled&#xD;
      participants in each treatment group within the stratified cohort will be assigned either the&#xD;
      amyloid or tau PET. Tracers to be used will be approved by sponsor and described in imaging&#xD;
      manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid biomarkers associated with AD pathology, brain imaging including amyloid or tau PET and&#xD;
      volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and measures of cognitive performance,&#xD;
      functioning in activities of daily living (ADL), and neuropsychiatric behavioral symptoms&#xD;
      will be collected at baseline and at scheduled times throughout the study. Participants who&#xD;
      terminate treatment early, will be encouraged to complete all safety and outcome procedures&#xD;
      as specified in the protocol's schedule of events.&#xD;
