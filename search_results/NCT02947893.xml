  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that Nilotinib will be safe in individuals with mild to&#xD;
      moderate AD. Specifically, investigators hypothesize that low daily oral doses of Nilotinib&#xD;
      will lead to CSF penetration, CNS Abl inhibition, and stabilization of CSF total Tau and&#xD;
      p-Tau231/181 and Abeta42/40 levels. The investigators hypothesize that Nilotinib will&#xD;
      decrease brain load of amyloid using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET). The&#xD;
      investigators also predict that Nilotinib will reduce CSF markers of cell death, including&#xD;
      neuron specific enolase (NSE) and S100B.&#xD;

      The investigators propose a novel treatment strategy that involves Abl inhibition to alter&#xD;
      Abeta40/42, total Tau and p-Tau231/181 in subjects with mild to moderate dementia due to AD.&#xD;
      The investigators pre-clinical studies show that Nilotinib inhibits brain Abl, decreases&#xD;
      Abeta and p-Tau, modulates brain and peripheral immune profiles and reverses cognitive&#xD;
      decline in AD models. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that Nilotinib is a&#xD;
      viable therapeutic candidate - via Abl inhibition - in subjects with AD. Based on strong&#xD;
      pre-clinical evidence about the effects of Nilotinib on neurodegenerative pathologies,&#xD;
      including autophagic clearance of neurotoxic proteins, immunity and behavior, the&#xD;
      investigators conducted an open label pilot clinical trial in advanced (stage 3-5) PD with&#xD;
      dementia (PDD) and Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) patients. Participants (N=12) were randomized 1:1&#xD;
      to once daily oral dose of 150mg and 300mg Nilotinib for 6 months. The investigators showed&#xD;
      that Nilotinib penetrates the blood brain barrier (BBB), in agreement with pre-clinical data.&#xD;
      Several studies show that Abeta42 is decreased and CSF total Tau and p-Tau are increased in&#xD;
      PD and LBD. Investigators data show that Nilotinib reverses loss of CSF Abeta40/42 and&#xD;
      significantly reduces (N=5, P&lt;0.05) CSF total Tau and p-Tau between baseline and 6 months&#xD;
      treatment. These biomarker changes are consistent with cognitive improvement (3.5-3.85&#xD;
      points) using Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) and the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease-Cognition (SCOPA-Cog) between baseline and 6 months. These data are very compelling&#xD;
      to evaluate the effects of Nilotinib in a phase II, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial in patients with mild to moderate AD.&#xD;
