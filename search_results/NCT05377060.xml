  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novel blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as plasma levels of tau&#xD;
      phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), have shown great promise in detecting early AD&#xD;
      pathology. While current studies point to this biomarker as having great clinical utility,&#xD;
      one necessary step before clinical implementation is developing safe and effective methods&#xD;
      for disclosure of results. Past risk disclosure studies have shown that disclosing risk for&#xD;
      AD based on genetics or amyloid status is safe, but these studies have largely focused on&#xD;
      cognitively unimpaired individuals. This study seeks to develop comprehensible educational&#xD;
      materials to aid risk disclosure and examine the effect of risk disclosure based on plasma&#xD;
      p-tau181 results in a group of participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at imminent&#xD;
      risk of converting to dementia. First, educational materials will be developed in&#xD;
      collaboration with health communication experts and then refined in focus groups made up of&#xD;
      individuals with MCI. Educational materials will be analyzed on several key reading and&#xD;
      comprehensibility metrics and will include personalized risk estimate based on a&#xD;
      well-accepted risk algorithm (Cullen, et al., 2021). Next, these educational materials will&#xD;
      be utilized to disclose risk in a randomized controlled trial with an active control arm&#xD;
      receiving disclosure based on age, sex, and cognitive status (based on Mini-Mental State&#xD;
      Examination), meant to mimic common methods of clinical diagnostic and prognostic decision&#xD;
      making, and an intervention arm receiving disclosure based on the above factors plus plasma&#xD;
      p-tau181 results. Outcomes will include measures of comprehension and psychological&#xD;
      well-being (anxiety, depression, hopelessness, and distress) and will be assessed immediately&#xD;
      after risk disclosure and again at six-month follow-up. It is hypothesized that risk&#xD;
      disclosure based on plasma p-tau181 is not more psychologically harmful or less&#xD;
      comprehensible than disclosure based on demographic factors and MMSE. This pilot study will&#xD;
      provide a necessary step towards moving plasma p-tau biomarkers towards safe clinical&#xD;
      implementation and will develop educational materials that can be utilized in future studies&#xD;
      and clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as plasma levels of tau&#xD;
      phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), have shown great promise in sensitively and&#xD;
      specifically detecting early AD pathology. Plasma p-tau181 has the potential to dramatically&#xD;
      reduce the financial strain and patient care burden associated with identifying patients at&#xD;
      increased risk of AD-dementia, as well as improve screening for enrollment in clinical trials&#xD;
      which require the presence of AD-pathological changes. While current studies point to this&#xD;
      biomarker as having great clinical utility, one necessary step before clinical implementation&#xD;
      is developing safe and effective methods for disclosure of results. Past risk disclosure&#xD;
      studies have shown that disclosing risk for AD based on genetics or amyloid status is safe,&#xD;
