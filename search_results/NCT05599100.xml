    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to improve the STAR-Caregivers Virtual Training &amp; Follow-up&#xD;
      (STAR-VTF) intervention for Latino caregivers of people living with dementia. The main&#xD;
      objectives are to: (1) culturally adapt STAR-VTF online training modules, (2) pilot test&#xD;
      Latino caregivers' responses to the adapted online training modules, and (3) develop an&#xD;
      online survey to collect caregiver outcomes in a future study. Participants will receive the&#xD;
      STAR-VTF intervention and asked to complete online surveys and participate in an exit&#xD;
      interview to provide feedback on their experience.&#xD;

      The objectives of this study are to: (1) culturally and linguistically adapt the&#xD;
      STAR-Caregivers Virtual Training &amp; Follow-up (STAR-VTF) online training modules for Latino&#xD;
      caregivers of people living with dementia (PLWD), (2) pilot test Latino caregivers' responses&#xD;
      to the adapted online training modules, and (3) develop a REDCap survey to pragmatically&#xD;
      collect caregiver outcomes in a future study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a single-arm pilot trial design with Latino caregivers of PLWD. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess self-reported outcomes at baseline and 6-8 weeks post-enrollment&#xD;
      using a REDCap survey. Outcome measures will include the Revised Memory and Problem Behavior&#xD;
      Checklist and Preparedness for Caregiving Scale. In addition, the investigators will assess&#xD;
      caregivers' perceived usability of the online training modules and will conduct qualitative&#xD;
      interviews 6-8 weeks post-enrollment. The interviews will assess caregiver satisfaction with&#xD;
      and acceptability of the adapted online training modules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to enroll up to 20 participants. The primary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to pilot test the adapted online training modules. Therefore, it is not powered to detect&#xD;
      an effect of the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Caregivers will rate memory, depression, and disruptive behavior problems in people living with dementia. The instrument contains 24 items (7 memory-related, 8 depressive, and 9 disruptive) that assess problem behaviors and are rated for frequency of occurrence during the past week and caregiver reaction to the problem behaviors.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers will rate how prepared they are for various aspects of caregiving. The instrument contains 8 items that ask caregivers how well prepared they believe they are to provide physical care, emotional support, deal with the stress of caregiving, and set up in-home support services. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all prepared) to 5 (very well prepared).</description>

    <description>For 6-8 weeks, caregivers will complete online training modules asynchronously. Caregivers will be instructed to complete one module per week. The content of the modules is as follows: Module 1 introduces caregivers to the behavioral treatment of dementia, realistic expectations, and effective communication; Module 2 covers the ABC (antecedents, behaviors, consequences) approach to problem-solving, including rationale and development of an ABC plan; Module 3 instructs caregivers to review the ABC plan and revise as needed; Module 4 covers pleasant events and managing negative thinking; Module 5 instructs caregivers to review the ABC plan, pleasant activities schedule, and to revise as needed; Module 6 covers coping with caregiving and maintaining gains. Each module takes about 45 minutes to complete. The modules use text, pictures, and illustrations with a voiceover presentation. Caregivers will receive the online training modules in their preferred language (English or Spanish).</description>
