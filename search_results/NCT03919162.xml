      This is a phase 2A multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group&#xD;
      study of varoglutamstat, with a stage gate to phase 2B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 2A there will be adaptive dosing evaluation of three dose levels with exposure to&#xD;
      varoglutamstat or placebo for a minimum of 24 weeks, with preliminary evaluation of both&#xD;
      cognitive function and pharmacodynamic changes on EEG spectral analysis in approximately 180&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that the stage gate for phase 2B is reached, then phase 2B will assesses&#xD;
      efficacy and longer-term safety in a larger study group, i.e., 414.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to advance a first-in-class, new small molecule treatment for early&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Varoglutamstat (PQ912) is an oral, twice daily medication that&#xD;
      addresses a novel and significantly differentiated amyloid target: N-terminal&#xD;
      post-translationally modified Ab (pGlu-Ab), a particularly toxic subspecies of amyloid beta&#xD;
      (Ab). This study will further evaluate whether varoglutamstat's mechanism of action can&#xD;
      result in a measurable therapeutic effect on cognition, function and relevant pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      and biological markers in early AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a phase 2A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial, with a&#xD;
      stage gate to phase 2B. Phase 2A will determine the highest dose that is both safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated. During this phase, there is an adaptive dosing evaluation, using a well-defined&#xD;
      safety stopping boundary, of three dose levels with exposure to varoglutamstat or placebo for&#xD;
      a minimum of 24 weeks to help determine which dose will be carried forward in phase 2B. A&#xD;
      sequential dose design will be employed in phase 2A where each of three dose cohorts are&#xD;
      randomized equally to placebo or varoglutamstat and treated for at least 8 weeks at the&#xD;
      originally assigned full dose. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to varoglutamstat or&#xD;
      placebo, and stratified between mild AD and MCI, as well as by site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2A also includes preliminary evaluation of both cognitive function and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      changes on electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that the stage gate for phase 2B is reached from data in this phase 2A study,&#xD;
      then phase 2B will assess the longer-term efficacy and safety of varoglutamstat in a larger&#xD;
      study group, using the highest dose selected in phase 2A. In phase 2B, a composite cognitive&#xD;
      and functional measure as well as PD biomarkers will be used to evaluate efficacy during the&#xD;
      extended treatment period.&#xD;
