  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of MK-2214 in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The primary hypothesis (Part 1) is that at a&#xD;
      generally well tolerated dose level, the true geometric mean concentration at Day 85 of&#xD;
      MK-2214 in cerebrospinal fluid is &gt;0.3 nanomolar (nM). Optional healthy older participants&#xD;
      (Part 2) may receive MK-2214 at dose levels determined by criteria met in Part 1.&#xD;
