  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effects of exogenously administered&#xD;
      nicotinamide riboside (NR) on brain energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and cognitive&#xD;
      function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's dementia&#xD;
      (AD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial function is mediated, in part, by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, decreases in NAD+ levels are associated with normal aging, and also with&#xD;
      numerous diseases such as AD. Accumulating evidence suggests that NR can enhance&#xD;
      mitochondrial function and help slow or reverse these age-related abnormalities. Numerous&#xD;
      preclinical and clinical studies have been performed using NR and related compounds to boost&#xD;
      NAD+ level in human subjects with various diseases or animal models. However, no studies to&#xD;
      date have investigated in vivo metabolic and bioenergetic changes (target engagement)&#xD;
      associated with NR supplementation. In this project, we aim to investigate the&#xD;
      neurobiological mechanisms and clinical effects of NR in patients with MCI and mild AD using&#xD;
      in vivo novel neuroimaging techniques.&#xD;
