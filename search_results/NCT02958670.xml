    <textblock>
      Cerebral accumulation of tau and beta-amyloid are major factors of Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      pathology. A novel Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracer (18-F-AV-1451) now offers the&#xD;
      ability to study tau protein deposition in vivo in subjects, in which information on cerebral&#xD;
      amyloid deposition has already been gathered. This enables to study effects of tau deposition&#xD;
      on neuronal integrity, their relation to effects of beta-amyloid deposition and how this&#xD;
      contributes to cognitive impairment or well-being in the elderly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center exploratory observational clinical study combining cross sectional&#xD;
      and longitudinal aspects. It contains 18F-AV-1451-PET as an intervention. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to measure tau deposition with 18-F-AV1451-PET based on voxel wise or volume&#xD;
      based quantitative assessments and to study the effects of Tau deposition on the organism by&#xD;
      identification of factors correlating to the measured tau deposition. Study participants will&#xD;
      be followed for up to 8 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date cerebral tau pathology in vivo was only estimated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau or&#xD;
      CSF phospho-tau which precludes a study of topical distribution and interplay with Abeta&#xD;
      pathology. 18F-AV-1451 offers the chance to visualize tau pathology and to study effects of&#xD;
      tau on brain structure, brain physiology and cognitive function. Ideally, these effects are&#xD;
      studied in well characterized individuals in whom other important pathological factors are&#xD;
      already known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore plan to study tau pathology measured by 18F-AV-1451 in subjects with already&#xD;
      existing data on cerebral amyloid deposition (11C-Pittsburgh Compound C, Flutemetamol). We&#xD;
      will be able to relate tau pathology to past and prospective cognitive performance assessed&#xD;
      by a detailed neuro¬psychological examination, and we will be able to investigate whether&#xD;
      cerebral tau pathology is reflected by peripheral blood biomarkers. For this purpose we will&#xD;
      include elderly subjects with various degrees of cognitive performance (cognitively healthy,&#xD;
      mild cognitive impairment, dementia) and various degrees of cerebral amyloid deposition&#xD;
      (dichotomized or quantitative). We will also include Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD)&#xD;
      cases to study tau effects in neurodegenerative disease in the absence of beta-amyloid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We assume that it is possible to identify tau deposition in subjects with and without&#xD;
           cerebral Abeta deposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We hypothesize that tau-deposition will be associated with structural and physiological&#xD;
           brain changes and that there are synergistic effects of the amount of tau and Abeta&#xD;
           pathology on certain brain regions and on cognitive function.&#xD;
