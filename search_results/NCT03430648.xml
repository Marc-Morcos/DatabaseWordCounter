      disease neuropathology to physical disability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impaired mobility is strongly linked to cognitive function and vice versa. Cognitive&#xD;
      functions are strongly associated with mobility function, most commonly assessed using gait&#xD;
      speed. In the Health ABC Study, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and Modified Mini&#xD;
      Mental Status (3MS) scores were significantly associated with gait speed and gait speed&#xD;
      decline. Poor lower extremity performance predicts faster age-related cognitive decline and&#xD;
      increased incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. This study will explore&#xD;
      the role of tau protein as the neuropathologic basis for these associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain imaging markers may be the link between cognitive measures and gait. White matter&#xD;
      disease is commonly measured by quantifying white matter (WM) lesion load, which is&#xD;
      associated with small vessel ischemic disease. More subtle microstructural changes can be&#xD;
      observed by calculating fractional anisotropy (FA) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Aging&#xD;
      is accompanied by changes in cortical volume, white matter microstructure and an increased&#xD;
      prevalence of WM lesions. WM lesions have been strongly implicated in declining physical&#xD;
      function. These brain changes are associated with impaired balance, slower movement speeds,&#xD;
      slower chair stand times and increased falls risk.Recently, Aâ accumulation in the brain has&#xD;
      also been linked to slow gait. This finding suggests a pathologic mechanism linking Alzheimer&#xD;
      s disease processes to gait impairments. However, Aâ accumulation itself may not be the&#xD;
      critical neuropathic change. In recent studies of Aâ42 and phosphorylated tau protein in&#xD;
      cerebral spinal fluid, it has been found that low Aâ42 levels themselves are not associated&#xD;
      with impaired cognition, but that elevated tau levels are also required. If the process of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment parallels the process of gait impairment, it might be that tau levels&#xD;
      are more important correlates of gait changes. To the investigators' knowledge the&#xD;
      relationship between CSF tau levels and mobility has never been explored. PET ligands for&#xD;
      brain tau have recently become available, but the relationship between brain tau accumulation&#xD;
      and gait has yet to be determined. In this study, investigators will relate gait&#xD;
      characteristics to CSF Aâ42 and phosphorylated tau levels, and perform brain PET imaging in a&#xD;
      subset to related tau protein accumulation to gait characteristics for the first time. Both&#xD;
      mobility impairment and Alzheimers disease (AD) occur in the context of the aging vascular&#xD;
      system. Over the past 15 years, it has been recognized that abnormalities of thoracic aortic&#xD;
      stiffness are associated with the development of abnormalities in small vessels supplying the&#xD;
      brain and kidneys. As the aorta stiffens, the propagation speed of the systolic flow wave&#xD;
      increases through the aortic lumen. (Stiffness within the thoracic aorta can be accomplished&#xD;
      through measurement of aortic pulse wave velocity.) In hypertensive patients, aortic archway&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity has been associated with increases in left ventricular mass as well as&#xD;
      lacunar brain infarcts independent of age, sex, and the duration of hypertension. In the&#xD;
      Multi-Ethnic Dallas Heart Study aortic arch pulse wave velocity is an independent predictor&#xD;
      of white matter hyper-intensities. In those with diabetes, increasing aortic stiffness&#xD;
      contributes to the development of small vessel microvascular dysfunction which is associated&#xD;
      with deep white matter atrophy as well as cognitive decline. Recently, a stiffness mismatch&#xD;
      between the thoracic aorta and small vessels within the cerebral microcirculation has been&#xD;
      described. This mismatch impacts microvascular pulsatility and appears to diminish diffusion&#xD;
      anisotrophy between the cerebral spinal fluid and the CNS microcirculation. This observation&#xD;
      may contribute to retained amyloid type protein in those with AD.&#xD;
