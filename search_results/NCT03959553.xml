  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is being conducted by the Sponsor to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      GV1001 (0.56 mg and 1.12 mg) administered subcutaneously as a treatment for moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). GV1001 has been shown to inhibit neurotoxicity, apoptosis, and the&#xD;
      production of reactive oxygen species induced by amyloid beta in neural stem cells by&#xD;
      mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). In&#xD;
      nonclinical studies, using both mild (early stage) and severe (late stage) AD mouse models,&#xD;
      GV1001 has been shown to improve cognitive function and memory, as well as significantly&#xD;
      reduce the amount of amyloid beta and tau proteins. The multifunctional effect of GV1001&#xD;
      makes it a promising therapeutic option for the treatment for AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose finding,&#xD;
      parallel-group Phase IIa study in participants with moderate AD. The study population will be&#xD;
      comprised of male and female participants between 55 and 85 years of age, inclusive, with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of probable AD based on National Institute of Neurological and Communicative&#xD;
      Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS ADRDA)&#xD;
      criteria. Participants must also meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&#xD;
      5th edition (DSM-V) criteria for dementia and have an Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)&#xD;
      score ≥10 to &lt;20. Participants or their legal representative, as well as the participant's&#xD;
      caregiver, must be able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening visit (up to 4 weeks prior to first dose), a 26-week&#xD;
      double blind treatment period, and an end-of-study (EOS) visit. In the event a participant&#xD;
      discontinues treatment or the study prematurely, the participant will be asked to return for&#xD;
      an early termination (ET) visit for safety assessments. These assessments are the same as&#xD;
      those done at the EOS visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization, eligibility of potential participants will be confirmed through an&#xD;
      adjudication process in which screening data (eg, MMSE) obtained to evaluate AD status are&#xD;
      reviewed by a central independent adjudicator. The adjudicator will review the scoring sheet&#xD;
      completed by the Investigator prior to randomization and provide an independent assessment of&#xD;
      the participant's eligibility and may request exclusion of a participant from entry into the&#xD;
      study. A central independent reader will review magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans or reports to confirm eligibility. Investigators must not randomize a&#xD;
      participant prior to receipt of this independent confirmation of the participant's&#xD;
      eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to treatment with either GV1001 0.56 mg, GV1001 1.12&#xD;
      mg, or placebo (normal saline) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Study treatment (GV1001 0.56 mg, GV1001 1.12&#xD;
      mg, or placebo) will be administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection every week for 4 weeks (4&#xD;
      times) followed by SC administration every 2 weeks through Week 24 (10 times) for a total of&#xD;
      14 SC administrations of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluations will be performed at baseline, Week 12, and Week 26 using the&#xD;
      Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS&#xD;
      cog), Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change (CIBIC)-Plus, Clinical Dementia Rating&#xD;
      - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living&#xD;
      scale (ADCS-ADL), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scales. The efficacy evaluations are&#xD;
      to be done in the same order at each visit. To ensure the objectivity and accuracy of the&#xD;
      study results, efficacy evaluations must be performed by adequately trained and experienced&#xD;
      clinicians. The raters must be certified for this study to administer the Mini-Mental State&#xD;
      Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS cog), Clinician's&#xD;
      Interview-Based Impression of Change (CIBIC)-Plus, Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes&#xD;
      (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL),&#xD;
      and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scales. Training, certification, and materials for&#xD;
      rating will be provided by a rater training group. To mitigate the risk of breaking the&#xD;
      blind, the efficacy evaluator is not to be involved in the participant's treatment or have&#xD;
      access to the record of reported Adverse Events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring for AEs, laboratory evaluations,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, vital sign measurements, and suicidal ideation and behavior&#xD;
      (C-SSRS). Pharmacodynamics will be evaluated by collecting blood and cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF) for analysis of biomarkers of AD. Blood samples will also be collected for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenicity analysis, including determination of GV1001 plasma&#xD;
      concentrations (sparse PK) and antibodies to GV1001.&#xD;
