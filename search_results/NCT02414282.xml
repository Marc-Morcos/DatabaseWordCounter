      This project will collect quantitative pilot data that will allow the characterization of&#xD;
      uptake and binding of 18F-AV-1451 (also known as F 18 T807), a novel tau imaging compound, in&#xD;
      individuals with Progressive Posterior Cortical Dysfunction (PPCD) and logopenic variant&#xD;
      primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA). The primary goal is to develop tau imaging technique as&#xD;
      an antecedent biomarker of cognitive decline. The investigators propose to obtain preliminary&#xD;
      data that will support the possibility of detecting cognitive decline in its earliest stages,&#xD;
      before the occurrence of dementia.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive a single intravenous bolus injection of approximately 6.5-10mCi (240-370MBq) of F 18 T807. For those who cannot tolerate the full exam, participants will receive single intravenous bolus injection of approximately 6.5-10mCi (240-370MBq) of F 18 T807.</description>

        Collaborating physicians and the Knight ADRC Clinical Core will refer participants to the&#xD;
        Knight ADRC Research Imaging (KARI) Program for MR and PET imaging to evaluate tau&#xD;
        distribution in the brains of cognitively normal and cognitively impaired individuals, with&#xD;
        the primary goal of developing this highly promising tau imaging technique as an antecedent&#xD;
        biomarker of cognitive decline. We propose to recruit groups of patients with PPCD and&#xD;
        lvPPA from the same clinical environment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female participants, at least 45 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical diagnosis of PPCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant is able and willing to undergo testing (MRI or CT, PET, radioactive tracer&#xD;
             injection, LP; for those unable to undergo an MRI, CT will be used to generate&#xD;
             regions-of-interest).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pre-menopausal women will have a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours of T807&#xD;
             drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, could increase risk to the&#xD;
             participant, limit the participant's ability to tolerate the experimental procedures,&#xD;
             or interfere with the collection/analysis of the data (for example, participants with&#xD;
             severe chronic back pain might not be able to lie still during the scanning&#xD;
             procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Is deemed likely unable to perform the imaging procedures for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has a high risk for Torsades de Pointes or is taking medications known to prolong QT&#xD;
             interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has hypersensitivity to F 18 T807 or any of its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Contraindications to PET, PET-CT or MR (e.g. electronic medical devices, inability to&#xD;
             lie still for long periods) that make it unsafe for the individual to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Severe claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Currently pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For those electing to undergo the optional lumbar puncture: on anticoagulant of any&#xD;
             form prior to lumbar puncture.&#xD;
