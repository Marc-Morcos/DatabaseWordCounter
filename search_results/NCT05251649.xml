  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, and cognition is&#xD;
      associated with cerebral concussion. Previous studies have found reduced gamma energy in the&#xD;
      brain of AD patients. Therefore, modulation of gamma activity in AD patients may help improve&#xD;
      cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and tolerability of transcranial&#xD;
      alternating current stimulation (tACS) combined with 40Hz sound stimulation in patients with&#xD;
      mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD); to compare the effects of tACS combined with sound&#xD;
      stimulation, tACS, and 40Hz sound stimulation on cognition in AD patients; and the effects of&#xD;
      tACS combined with sound stimulation, tACS, and 40Hz sound stimulation on brain network&#xD;
      connectivity in AD patients before and after tACS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of people with Alzheimer's disease is increasing every year, but the available&#xD;
      drugs are not effective. Both transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and sound&#xD;
      stimulation are non-invasive methods to modulate Central Nervous System excitability. tACS&#xD;
      has been shown to modulate cognitive processes by affecting intrinsic oscillatory&#xD;
      manipulation and entrainment in the brain. And 40 Hz sound stimulation reduces Aβ amyloid&#xD;
      deposition in the hippocampus of AD mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty patients with mild-to-moderate AD will be recruited in this randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      controlled study. The researchers will evaluate whether tACS (40Hz) to the DLPFC region or&#xD;
      40Hz sound stimulation to both ears improves cognition in patients with mild to moderate AD.&#xD;
      The study will also investigate which stimulation method has a more pronounced and sustained&#xD;
      improvement in cognition in the following three groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into three groups, with the first group receiving tACS combined&#xD;
      with sound stimulation, the second group receiving tACS alone, and the third group receiving&#xD;
      sound stimulation alone. All will receive three weeks (15 sessions) of treatment. Patients&#xD;
      will be assessed by neuropsychological testing at baseline, post-treatment (21 days) and at&#xD;
      the 3-month follow-up. Subjects will be compared by functional MRI at baseline and&#xD;
      post-treatment for brain network connectivity before and after treatment.&#xD;
