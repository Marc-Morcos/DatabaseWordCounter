  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Grounding refers to having direct contact with the Earth, such as walking barefoot or lying&#xD;
      on the ground. Research has found that grounding can improve inflammation, free radical&#xD;
      damage, blood pressure, sleep quality, pain, stress, mood, and wound healing. However, there&#xD;
      has been no re-search on the effect of utilizing grounding for patients with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD). Thus, in this study, the investigators explore the effectiveness of grounding&#xD;
      as a non-pharmacological therapy for treating sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression in&#xD;
      patients with mild AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with mild AD were enrolled in the study. The electrochemical analyzer CHI 1205b was&#xD;
      employed to check the electrochemical signals at acupoints KI1 and GV16. The investigators&#xD;
      used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) to evaluate sleep quality, anxiety, and depression,&#xD;
      respectively, at weeks 0 and 12.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The investigators use a grounding wire and a sham grounding wire to create grounding and sham-grounding groups. The patients are blinded to the grounding because they do not know which one has a grounding effect according to the exterior of the mat.&#xD;
The investigators who do the evaluation of questionnaire and electrochemical analyzer and the outcomes assessor who interpret the data do not know which wire has grounding effect, too.</masking_description>

The investigators measure the electric current before the patients participate the study (week 0, baseline data). After receiving 12 weeks grounding, the investigators measure the electric current again (week 12, post grounding data).</description>
