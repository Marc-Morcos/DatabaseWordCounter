    <textblock>
      The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To determine the presence and regional distribution of microglial activation, as&#xD;
      assessed by Fluorine-18 (18F) labeled &quot;Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptor 06&quot; (PBR06) -PET,&#xD;
      in subjects with active Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), Secondary Progressive&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as compared to healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the relationship between microglial activation and clinical variables&#xD;
           including disease severity and comorbidities (such as pain, fatigue and/or depression),&#xD;
           as well as clinical MRI findings (such as lesions and atrophy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A pilot substudy aims to establish the non-inferiority of [F-18]PBR06 as compared with&#xD;
           Carbon-11 [C-11] labeled &quot;Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptor 28&quot; (PBR28) PET in patients&#xD;
           with RRMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The working hypothesis is that there is microglial activation in multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease as compared to healthy controls and that the pattern/&#xD;
      regional distribution of microglial activation is different in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) versus&#xD;
      AD and correlates with disease severity and comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators hypothesize that [F-18]PBR06-PET scans will be at least as&#xD;
      good as [C-11]PBR28-PET scans, the current gold standard.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four groups of subjects will be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects meeting the definition for RRMS by the International Panel Criteria, who are&#xD;
           active, as defined by at least one MS relapse in the past 12 months, or at least one&#xD;
           gadolinium enhancing lesion on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) within 3 months of&#xD;
           enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects meeting the definition for SPMS by International Panel Criteria and who have&#xD;
           demonstrated deterioration in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score in last 1&#xD;
           year&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects meeting the definition for probable AD based on National Institute of&#xD;
           Neurological and Communicable Diseases-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders&#xD;
           Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. In terms of severity of disease, we will select&#xD;
           subjects with mild AD, as defined by Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score of&#xD;
           20-26.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Healthy Controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in two phases. In the early pilot phase, 8 subjects with RRMS&#xD;
      will undergo both [C-11]PBR28 PET scan and [F-18]PBR06 PET scan. At the end of this phase, a&#xD;
      formal interim analysis will be performed and if imaging characteristics of [F-18]PBR06 are&#xD;
      found non-inferior to or better than [C-11]PBR28, rest of the study will be completed using&#xD;
      [F-18]PBR06. All subjects will also undergo 3-Tesla (3T) MRI of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal sample size is 30 subjects including 6 healthy controls, 8 subjects with relapsing&#xD;
      remitting MS, 8 subjects with secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and 8 subjects with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited by the PI, one of the other co-investigators, or a staff member&#xD;
      listed on the protocol at the Partners MS Center and the Behavioral Neurology Clinic of&#xD;
      Brigham and Women's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side Effects Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No side effects from the radiopharmaceuticals are expected. The dose of radiopharmaceutical&#xD;
      being administered in this study is below that at which we would expect any effect, including&#xD;
      physical dependence and addiction. Subjects will be exposed to a small amount of radiation.&#xD;
      The radiotracer will be prepared in such a way as to ensure that it is sterile and pyrogen&#xD;
      free, and its radiochemical purity (RCP) will be determined using Silica Gel-Instant Thin&#xD;
      Layer Chromatography and/or high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). In addition, because&#xD;
      both [F-18]PBR06 and [C-11]PBR28 are non-FDA approved radioligands, their use for this study&#xD;
      will be reviewed by Radioactive Drugs Research Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject monitoring during MRI and PET scans will be performed using a 2-way intercom system&#xD;
      between the scanner operator and subject and by visual monitoring of the subject through the&#xD;
      window into the scan room (the subject is visible to the operator at all times).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will need to lie still in the PET camera for period of 120 min, and subjects may&#xD;
      find it uncomfortable to remain still over this time. Therefore, as mentioned above, subjects&#xD;
      will be given the opportunity to take a break for up to 20 minutes after 70 minutes of PET&#xD;
      scanning, following which the last 30 minutes of scanning will be completed. A standard&#xD;
      head-support device will be used to make the subjects comfortable during the scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects find an intravenous catheter or duration of scanning too uncomfortable, they are&#xD;
      free to withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI scans take place in a confined space that makes some people claustrophobic.&#xD;
      Claustrophobic individuals will be excluded from the study. Also during the scan the subject&#xD;
      will hear loud banging noises and will therefore wear ear plugs to reduce this noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians at the Partners MS Center and the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) Behavioral&#xD;
      Neurology clinic may present the study to a subject during a regular scheduled clinic visit.&#xD;
      If the subject is interested in the study, a copy of the consent form will be given. At the&#xD;
      time of the subject's initial screening visit, a licensed physician investigator will answer&#xD;
      any questions the subject may have regarding the study and subsequently obtain informed&#xD;
      consent. In accordance with NIH guidelines, efforts will be made to attain a mix of study&#xD;
      participants, in terms of gender and racial/ethnic representation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from the subjects by a licensed physician investigator on&#xD;
      the study protocol. If the investigator is a clinician from the MS Center or Behavioral&#xD;
      Neurology clinic, they will not be allowed to obtain consent from their own patients.&#xD;
      Existing MS Center or Behavioral Neurology clinic subjects may be sent a letter describing&#xD;
      the study and a copy of the consent document. Interested subjects are directed to contact&#xD;
      research staff via a telephone number provided in the letter inviting participation in the&#xD;
      study to set up a screening visit. They will have the opportunity to discuss the study with&#xD;
      research study staff prior to giving consent as outlined above. Subjects approached for&#xD;
      participation in the study during a routine clinical visit will have the opportunity to&#xD;
      participate in the study at that time or they may choose to return for participation at&#xD;
      another time in the future. All subjects will be informed that they are free to withdraw&#xD;
      consent from the study at any time without affecting the quality or type of care that they&#xD;
      receive at BWH. Subjects will be informed that they may not qualify for the study if their&#xD;
      genetic analysis reveals that they are low affinity binders for translocator protein (TSPO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Quality Assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, subjects will be followed by their clinical neurologists for adverse&#xD;
      events and disease progression. If problems are reported to their physicians, they will&#xD;
      receive care as is normally performed. In addition, the Principal Investigator (PI) will&#xD;
      review all laboratory results of tests undergone by the subjects during the study period and&#xD;
      help co-ordinate any necessary care with patient's primary providers.&#xD;
