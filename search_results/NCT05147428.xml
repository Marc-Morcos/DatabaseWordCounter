  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Potentially inappropriate prescribing includes the use of medications that may no longer be&#xD;
      necessary or that may increase the risk of harm. Inappropriate prescribing can increase the&#xD;
      overall symptom burden, and negatively affect health-related quality of life and function.&#xD;
      The inappropriate prescription of certain drug categories such as sedative/hypnotics,&#xD;
      antipsychotics, and strong anticholinergic agents poses particular risks for older adults,&#xD;
      and may be more common among those with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease- related&#xD;
      dementias (AD/ADRD) due to a higher prevalence of multimorbidity and more frequent&#xD;
      prescription of five or more medications. The D-PRESCRIBE-AD (Developing a PRogram to Educate&#xD;
      and Sensitize Caregivers to Reduce the Inappropriate Prescription Burden in Elderly with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease) study will test a health plan-based intervention using the NIH&#xD;
      Collaboratory's Distributed Research Network, which employs the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) Sentinel System infrastructure. The overarching goal of this randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial is to assess the effect of a patient/caregiver- centered, multifaceted educational&#xD;
      intervention on potentially inappropriate prescribing in patients with AD/ADRD. The research&#xD;
      hypothesis is that education on inappropriate prescribing among patients/caregivers and their&#xD;
      providers can reduce medication-related morbidity in patients with AD/ADRD and improve&#xD;
      medication safety for this vulnerable population. The study population will include&#xD;
      community-dwelling patients with AD/ADRD, identified based on diagnoses codes of AD/ADRD or&#xD;
      use of a medication for Alzheimer's Disease, who have evidence of potentially inappropriate&#xD;
      prescribing the three drug classes above. The trial will evaluate the effect of educational&#xD;
      interventions designed to spur patient/caregiver-provider communication about medication&#xD;
      safety (versus usual care) on the proportion of patients with inappropriate prescribing, the&#xD;
      primary outcome of this study. The trial will be conducted in two large, national health&#xD;
      plans.&#xD;
