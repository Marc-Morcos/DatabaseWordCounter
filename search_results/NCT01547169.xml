  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine the effects of intranasally administered long-acting insulin detemir&#xD;
      on cognition in persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (aMCI). The rationale for these studies is derived from growing evidence that insulin&#xD;
      contributes to multiple brain functions, and that insulin dysregulation can contribute to AD&#xD;
      pathogenesis. Thus, therapies aimed at restoring normal insulin signaling in the CNS may have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on brain function. Intranasal administration of insulin increases insulin&#xD;
      signaling in brain without raising peripheral levels and causing hypoglycemia. Insulin&#xD;
      detemir is an insulin analogue that may have better action in brain than other insulin&#xD;
      formulations because of its albumin binding properties. The investigators will test the&#xD;
      therapeutic effects of intranasally-administered insulin detemir in a dose-finding study in&#xD;
      which participants will receive one of two doses of insulin detemir or placebo for a three&#xD;
      week period. The investigators will test the hypothesis that either dose will improve memory&#xD;
      and daily functioning in persons with AD/aMCI compared with placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well-known that insulin, a hormone that is naturally secreted by the pancreas, plays an&#xD;
      important physiological role by regulating blood sugar levels in the body. The investigators&#xD;
      now know that insulin plays many important roles in the brain as well. Insulin seems to be&#xD;
      especially active in the part of the brain that corresponds to learning and memory. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that when people have insufficient insulin in the brain (which, for example, is&#xD;
      the case with Type-II diabetes), they are increasingly at risk to develop memory problems and&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. In a past study, the investigators administered intravenous insulin to&#xD;
      participants and found that it improves their memory. However, that particular method would&#xD;
      not be a practical intervention for people with Alzheimer's disease due to the risk of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia or exacerbation of insulin resistance. Instead, the investigators use an&#xD;
      &quot;intranasal&quot; method of administration, in which the insulin is inserted into a device, and&#xD;
      administered intranasally. In this method, the insulin travels directly to the brain, and&#xD;
      bypasses the body. Our past studies have also demonstrated that this can be a reliable way to&#xD;
      improve memory, and it does not change the body's blood glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our past studies, the investigators have used regular insulin, which lasts about 3-4 hours&#xD;
      and creates a similar &quot;spike&quot; in insulin that one would have after eating a meal. However, in&#xD;
      normal physiology, the pancreas also releases small and more constant &quot;pulses&quot; of insulin&#xD;
      throughout the day and night, establishing a base level of insulin. Accordingly, several&#xD;
      longer-lasting types of insulin are now available that last closer to 10-12 hours, mimicking&#xD;
      that base level of insulin. The current study uses a long-lasting type of insulin called&#xD;
      &quot;insulin detemir,&quot; to determine if learning and memory will benefit from a more constant&#xD;
      supplement of insulin. the investigators want to determine whether this treatment can benefit&#xD;
      people who already have a memory impairment-either they already have a diagnosis of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease or are diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, a condition that&#xD;
      precedes Alzheimer's disease, and whether a lower or higher dose of insulin detemir is more&#xD;
      effective. The investigators will examine cognition, daily function, and different markers of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease that are in the blood as outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have these specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators will test the hypothesis that compared to placebo, three weeks of&#xD;
           treatment with intranasal insulin detemir will improve cognition and function in adults&#xD;
           with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will determine which of two doses of intranasal insulin detemir&#xD;
           produces the greatest improvement in cognition and daily function relative to placebo&#xD;
           for adults with AD or MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine these hypotheses, the investigators are recruiting approximately 60 participants&#xD;
      who have been diagnosed with AD or MCI. They will be randomly selected to take a lower dose&#xD;
      of insulin detemir, a higher dose of insulin detemir, or saline (which is an inactive&#xD;
      substance and will serve as a placebo). Cognition and the level of daily function will be&#xD;
      tested before they begin the study drug, and after 3 weeks of the study drug. The&#xD;
      investigators will also measure glucose tolerance and take blood samples to measure markers&#xD;
      of AD in the blood.&#xD;
