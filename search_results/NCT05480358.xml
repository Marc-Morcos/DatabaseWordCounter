      The wide-acting effects of Fasting-Mimicking Diets (FMDs) on metabolic, inflammatory and&#xD;
      regenerative pathways leading to reduced pathology or risk factors for various diseases in&#xD;
      mice and humans, has the potential to be effective against Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is&#xD;
      proposed to conduct a randomized clinical trial of twelve monthly cycles of the ProlonADTM&#xD;
      diet (by L-Nutra) vs. placebo diet in patients with aMCI or mild AD (MMSE 18-23). The primary&#xD;
      endpoint of the study will be the feasibility and safety of the twelve cycles of ProlonADTM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment that exceeds the physiological decline associated with aging can take&#xD;
      the form of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or, in its most severe form, dementia. In turn,&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with MCI evolve towards outright Alzheimer's disease (AD) in an estimated&#xD;
      percentage of 15%/year. MCI can occur in the form of amnestic MCI (amnestic MCI, aMCI; by far&#xD;
      the most common) or non-amnestic MCI (single or multiple domain), where amnestic is the form&#xD;
      that most frequently evolves into AD. Therefore this clinical trial will focus on the latter&#xD;
      (as well as on the AD). Diet cycles with low sugar and protein levels followed by diets with&#xD;
      normal levels of these lead to temporary reductions in growth hormone and IGF-1 levels. Both&#xD;
      are potential mediators of the neuroprotective and regenerative effects of these diets not&#xD;
      only in mice, but also in monkeys and humans . However, heavily restricted diets in terms of&#xD;
      calories are often difficult to endure over time and are frequently associated with side&#xD;
      effects, even significant ones and with progressive weight loss, in particular of lean mass.&#xD;
      In a mouse model of AD, it has been shown that periodic cycles of a &quot;fasting-mimicking&quot; diet&#xD;
      (FMD) restricted in protein content (PR-FMD) but not in terms of calories are able to reduce&#xD;
      levels plasma levels of IGF-1 with contrasting effects on the neurodegeneration process. In&#xD;
      particular, such FMD has been shown to reduce by about 30-70%, the levels of&#xD;
      hyperphosphorylated tau protein (one of the typical markers of AD) at the hippocampal level,&#xD;
      reducing the age-related deficit of cognitive performance. A relevant neuroregenerative&#xD;
      effect (associated with a clinical improvement in motor coordination and memory) has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in mice subjected to a diet based on a similar DMD during their &quot;average life&quot;&#xD;
      (months 16-30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed to conduct a study of twelve monthly cycles of the ProlonADTM diet (by&#xD;
      L-Nutra) in patients with aMCI or mild AD (MMSE 18-23) diagnosed according to the criteria&#xD;
      defined by Peterson and McKahn, respectively (1, 3 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed to conduct a randomized clinical trial of twelve monthly cycles of the&#xD;
      ProlonADTM diet (by L-Nutra) vs. placebo diet in patients with aMCI or mild AD (MMSE 18-23).&#xD;
      Patients in the treatment group alone will also receive a range of supplements containing&#xD;
      omega-3 fatty acids, caffeine, tree nuts, coconut oil, olive oil and cocoa - which will be&#xD;
      supplied with the ProlonADTM diet kit. Patients assigned to both arms will also receive&#xD;
      personalized dietary recommendations matched to instructions for light-moderate physical&#xD;
      activity to be carried out also at home and aimed, especially in the case of patients&#xD;
      assigned to receive ProlonADTM, to prevent the loss of lean mass. The primary endpoint of the&#xD;
      study will be the feasibility and safety of the twelve cycles of ProlonADTM. Feasibility is&#xD;
      defined as taking at least one course of DMD every two months with the option of admitting&#xD;
      consumption of 50% of the planned diet and / or a maximum consumption of 10 Kcal / kg of&#xD;
      unforeseen food in only one of days 1-5 of each cycle. Investigators speculate that&#xD;
      ProlonADTM will not cause severe side effects and that it will have no detrimental effect on&#xD;
      the patient's body composition, specifically in terms of impact on lean mass measured by&#xD;
      dynamometry and bioimpedance analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  conversion rate to AD (for patients with aMCI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  episodic memory evaluated with Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCRST);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cognitive status assessed by MMSE, CDR-Sum of the boxes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  functional status assessed with Barthel Index, IADL;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  emotional state assessed using the CESD-R scale;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nutritional status (MNA and body composition - bioimpedance, handgrip);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  caregiver stress assessed through Caregiver Burden Inventory and NPI;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life of patients (QLQ-AD);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  inflammatory markers, oxidative stress markers, neuronal damage markers (Neurofilament&#xD;
           Light, NfL), quantification of circulating stem cells, cell aging markers (eg evaluation&#xD;
           of the telomerase activity of lymphocytes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assessment of frailty (Rockwood frailty index, which also includes walking speed,&#xD;
           handgrip, breathing capacity)&#xD;

    <description>The ProlonADTM diet, which will be taken by the patient once a month for 5 days, is a low-calorie and low-protein diet, and provides all the micronutrients necessary to avoid malnutrition. The diet will be performed in twelve consecutive months. The components of the diet will be approximately 30% calorie restricted and 50% protein restricted but supplemented with 50% of the RDA in vitamins and minerals and also supplemented with both nonessential and essential amino acids identified in animal studies to be effective. Prolon by L-Nutra is a medically-designed dietary kit providing the food to eat for five days. Day 1 of Prolon provides ~4600 kJ (11% protein, 46% fat, and 43%carbohydrate), whereas days 2-to-5 provide ~3000 kJ (9% protein, 44% fat, and 47% carbohydrate) per day.</description>
