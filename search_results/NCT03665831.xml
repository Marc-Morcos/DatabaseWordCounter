  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will be examining the effects of the deep repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using the H1 coil in patients over the age of 60&#xD;
      diagnosed with mild to early-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (MCI) and comorbid Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have been unable to tolerate or failed&#xD;
      to respond to antidepressant medications. The coil was designed to stimulate deeper regions&#xD;
      of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Based on prior research, the&#xD;
      investigators propose that active stimulation with the H1 coil for 4 weeks may result in&#xD;
      significant remission rates and will be tolerable and safe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of H1-coil dTMS in&#xD;
      treating depression in MCI and mild AD patients over 60 years of age who have not tolerated&#xD;
      or failed to respond to antidepressant medications. 28 patients will be assigned to receive 4&#xD;
      consecutive weeks of daily active dTMS treatment. The long-term effects of treatment on&#xD;
      emotional cognitive measures will be assessed at a 4-week follow-up visit (8 weeks from&#xD;
      baseline). Symptom change and remission criteria will be assessed using the Montogmery-Asberg&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Cognition will be assessed using a validated&#xD;
      neuropsychological battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also offer patients to receive 4 weeks of treatment using theta-burst TMS, which is a&#xD;
      milder version of TMS.&#xD;

    <description>Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (dTMS) is a new form of TMS which allows direct stimulation of deeper neuronal pathways than the standard TMS. The H-coil is a novel dTMS coil designed to allow deeper brain stimulation without a significant increase of electric fields induced in superficial cortical regions. dTMS will be administered daily for 4 consecutive weeks.</description>
