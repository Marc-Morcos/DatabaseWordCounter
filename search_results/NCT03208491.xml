      The main objective of AZ@GAME ECO is to evaluate the cost-utility of the management of&#xD;
      patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease using a serious game providing cognitive and&#xD;
      physical straining compared to a usual management. Among the secondary objectives it is&#xD;
      important to assess the real life feasibility in different types of care structures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With the aging of the population, Alzheimer's disease and associated disorders represent a&#xD;
      major public health challenge. To date there is no pharmacological treatment to stop the&#xD;
      degenerative process or behavioral disorders. This explains the importance of&#xD;
      non-pharmacological approaches to stimulate cognition, reduce behavioral disorders or improve&#xD;
      quality of life. Non-pharmacological therapies are the central focus of care, especially for&#xD;
      patients accommodated on a part-time basis (Day Hospital, Respite Platform) or Full-Time&#xD;
      nursing home (EHPAD in French). TNM also holds an important place for patients living at&#xD;
      home, and belongs to the very general framework of informal care, which is a significant&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, the cost of taking care of patients over 75 with this type of pathology is&#xD;
      estimated between 24.2 and 30 billion euros per year, which is more than cancer or&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, new information and communication technologies (ICTs) play an increasingly&#xD;
      important part in our daily lives and can be a support in the field of health. In this&#xD;
      context, ICTs are of great interest for evaluation, rehabilitation and assistance. At the&#xD;
      level of care, the aim is to propose applications to train and / or stimulate cognitions,&#xD;
      behavior and motivation. Serious Games (SG) are part of this framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Az @ GAME (Alzheimer's Disease and serious games), is the winner of the e-health project&#xD;
      2011-2015. This program has enabled several SGs to be developed that allow physical and&#xD;
      cognitive workouts to be carried out with a therapist. The AZ @ GAME-ECO + study is a new and&#xD;
      innovative step as it represents the first combined evaluation of the cost and usefulness of&#xD;
      managing patients with Alzheimer's disease using the serious Games (SG). In AZ @ GAME-ECO +&#xD;
      SGs are a new tool for institutions involved in patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The main objective of AZ@GAME ECO is to evaluate the cost-utility of the&#xD;
      management of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease using a serious game providing&#xD;
      cognitive and physical straining compared to a usual management. Among the secondary&#xD;
      objectives it is important to assess the real life feasibility in different types of care&#xD;
      structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION Male or Female ≥ 60 years of age / with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease or&#xD;
      related disorders (CIM10) condition with a Mini Mental State Examination score between 12 and&#xD;
      24. Patients are monitored in one of the centers participating in the study (Day Hospital,&#xD;
      nursing home, Memory Consultation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD This multi-center study involves 18 participating centers: Dependent Elderly Care&#xD;
      Facilities (EHPAD), Day Care Centers, and Memory Centers, with the inclusion of 144 subjects&#xD;
      (72 subjects per group and 8 subjects per center). It will be done in open form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, the centers belonging to the intervention group use the SG for 3 months&#xD;
      (2 sessions per week). The control group centers will be able to use the SG at the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medico-economic and clinical evaluations will be performed at baseline, at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention (M3) and 3 months after the intervention (M6). An incremental cost-utility ratio&#xD;
      will be calculated to compare the management with SG therapeutics and the usual management&#xD;
      from a societal perspective and with a time horizon of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BENEFITS To gain a better understanding of the medico-economic benefits and usability of a&#xD;
      new technology to train cognitive, physical functions while promoting motivation and social&#xD;
      engagement in Alzheimer's disease patients in situations Usual care in Daycare, Nursing home&#xD;
      and Memory center.&#xD;
