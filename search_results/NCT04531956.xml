  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a mixed-methods design the investigators will study decision making processes and&#xD;
      experiences regarding a diagnostic trajectory before and after the introduction of a patient&#xD;
      decision aid for people with memory complaints, their significant others and their GPs. The&#xD;
      'before group' will receive diagnostics as usual from their GPs. The 'after group' will use&#xD;
      the patient decision aid. The investigators expect the patient decision aid to increase the&#xD;
      level of SDM and to contribute to a timely and personalized diagnostic trajectory. Data will&#xD;
      be collected using semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and information retrieved from&#xD;
      people with memory complaints' medical records.&#xD;

      Study design This study will use a before-after mixed-methods design. In the before group&#xD;
      (BG) GPs will execute care as usual in the decision-making process for a diagnostic&#xD;
      trajectory for memory complaints. In the after group (AG), a patient decision aid will be&#xD;
      added to the decision-making process provided by the GP. The same GPs will participate in&#xD;
      both the BG and the AG, which maximizes the comparability between the BG and the AG. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to use the mixed-methods approach to gain a broad and in-depth&#xD;
      understanding of the issues important for people with memory complaints, their significant&#xD;
      others, and the GPs involved in the decision-making process. This approach is taken to fully&#xD;
      unravel the complexity of the decision-making process for a diagnostic trajectory for memory&#xD;
      complaints and of the SDM intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting The study was developed by Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC+) in close&#xD;
      collaboration with Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen (Radboudumc Nijmegen). The&#xD;
      participating GPs, people with memory complaints and their significant others will be&#xD;
      recruited from general practices located in the south-eastern part of the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Patient involvement Before the start of the study, a client panel of the&#xD;
      Alzheimer Centre Limburg (i.e. a panel consisting of people with dementia and their&#xD;
      significant others) was asked to reflect on the research design. During the study, people&#xD;
      with memory complaints and their significant others will be closely involved in the&#xD;
      development and implementation of the SDM-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and study participants First, the researchers will approach GPs working in the&#xD;
      south-eastern part of the Netherlands with an information letter about the study. No specific&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria have been formulated for the GPs. GPs who want to&#xD;
      participate will be asked to return an application form to the research team. Subsequently,&#xD;
      the research team will then provide participating GPs with study material (patient&#xD;
      application forms, information letters, and informed consent forms). GPs will be asked to&#xD;
      recruit patients with memory complaints during an inclusion period of 6 months in both the&#xD;
      before and after group. In the before group, the GPs will inform potential participants about&#xD;
      the study after a decision about a diagnostic trajectory (i.e. to wait and see, undergo&#xD;
      diagnostic testing by the GP, or referral to a medical centre) has been made. Patients can be&#xD;
      included up to a maximum of 3 months after a decision has been made. Significant others of&#xD;
      people with memory complaints will be asked to participate as well; their participation is&#xD;
      preferred, but not required. The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study are shown in&#xD;
      Table 1. If a potential participant is interested in the study, the GP will send his/her&#xD;
      contact details to the researchers. The researchers will contact the potential participant to&#xD;
      provide detailed information about the study. Eligible participants will sign informed&#xD;
      consent forms before participation. The inclusion/consent procedure in the after group will&#xD;
      be finalized based on the developed intervention in a later stage of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Given the dependence between patients and their GPs in our sample, clustering of&#xD;
      patients per GP was taken into account in sample size calculations. Clusters were expected to&#xD;
      include at least two people with memory complaints and intraclass correlation to be 0.05 or&#xD;
      lower. To achieve power of 0.8 and 2-sided testing at 0.05, 35 GPs are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore aim to include between 30 and 40 GPs in our study which seems to&#xD;
      be a realistic number based on a previous (comparable) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the qualitative component of the study, it is expected that interviews with 15-30&#xD;
      patients, with or without their significant other will be sufficient to reach data-saturation&#xD;
      (i.e. the point at which interviews reveal no new information or insights). Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to participate in an interview based on the outcome of the decision-making process&#xD;
      (i.e. to wait and see, undergo diagnostic testing at the GP, be referred to a medical center&#xD;
      for advanced diagnostic testing). In this way, the investigators can ensure that each&#xD;
      'choice-category' is represented in the selective sample. From those patients not selected&#xD;
      for the interviews, only qualitative data from their medical journals (e.g. free text notes)&#xD;
      will be analysed. This procedure will be the same in the before and after group. For the&#xD;
      interviews with the GPs, it is anticipated that participation of 20-25% of the included GPs&#xD;
      will be enough to reach data-saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Quantitative analysis Descriptive analyses will be conducted on the&#xD;
      sociodemographic characteristics of people with memory complaints, their significant others,&#xD;
      and GPs. To assess the decision-making process, descriptive analyses will be conducted on:&#xD;
      number of consultations before final decision, final decision (i.e. number of decisions in&#xD;
      each 'choice category'), level of SDM, and level of self-efficacy regarding SDM as indicated&#xD;
      by GPs. Data will be reported as percentages, numeric counts, and means/standard deviations&#xD;
      (SD). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis will be performed to investigate: (1) whether&#xD;
      sociodemographic characteristics or characteristics of the decision-making process are&#xD;
      related to the outcome of the decision-making process or to the level of SDM and (2) whether&#xD;
      the level of SDM is associated with the outcome of the decision-making process. A random&#xD;
      effect multilevel analysis will be used to assess changes in the decision-making process&#xD;
      before and after implementing the SDM intervention while taking clustering at the GP level&#xD;
      into account. Baseline characteristics will be added as confounders in case of observed&#xD;
      differences in the before and after group. Integration of these analyses with qualitative&#xD;
      measures will help explain these results. All analyses will be conducted using SPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analysis Qualitative methods will be used to analyse data regarding experiences&#xD;
      in the decision-making process, SDM, and decisional conflict. Interviews will be audio-taped&#xD;
      and transcribed verbatim. Two independent researchers will analyse the transcripts using&#xD;
      content analysis. The same researchers will agree on codes, combine codes to create&#xD;
      categories (axial coding), and combine categories and refine themes (selective coding).&#xD;
      Atlas.ti will be used to support the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed model analysis Integration of quantitative and qualitative research methods will be&#xD;
      applied during data collection as well as during analyses. During data collection, attention&#xD;
      will be paid to 'building' and 'merging'. Building will be applied by selecting patients for&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews based on quantitative data such as age, gender, and the final&#xD;
      decision outcome of the decision-making process. GPs will be selected based on their scores&#xD;
      on the quantitative measures SDM-Q-Doc and the self-efficacy VAS as well as on the same&#xD;
      criteria of age and gender. Merging will be applied through tailoring topic lists for the&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews to the personal situation of patients and their significant&#xD;
      others, a task which will be accomplished with the help of information from their medical&#xD;
      record. During data analyses, 'merging' and 'embedding' will be applied (i.e. qualitative&#xD;
      data will be used to explain identified patterns in quantitative outcome measures which will&#xD;
      provide insight into the working mechanisms of the SDM intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and Dissemination Care as usual will most likely not be influenced in the before group&#xD;
      of the S-DeciDeD project. Only a small-time investment will be required from GPs and&#xD;
      patients: 5 minutes for completing the questionnaires and twenty minutes for participating in&#xD;
      the interview. The protocol of the before group has been approved by the Medical Review&#xD;
      Ethics Committee (MEC) of the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC+) in the&#xD;
      Netherlands, number 2018-0333. Data collection in the before group will start in the&#xD;
      beginning of 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol for the after group will be submitted to the MEC after the development of the&#xD;
      patient decision aid as judgement should include full information on this novel intervention.&#xD;
      The S-DeciDeD project is part of the national Memorabel programme funded by ZonMw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, as Maastricht University aims to become a FAIR (Findable, Accessible,&#xD;
      Interoperable and Re-usable) university, the data will also be published on DataverseNL&#xD;
      (https://dataverse.nl/). This is a website where researchers can upload their anonymous data&#xD;
      with restricted access, which allows other researchers to use the data or replicate the&#xD;
      findings after receiving permission from the S-DeciDeD project. Finally, the findings will be&#xD;
      published in peer-reviewed international journals and presented at conferences and in one&#xD;
      dissertation.&#xD;
