  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an eight-week, prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to evaluate a&#xD;
      patient-centered team (pharmacist-physician) intervention to improve medication&#xD;
      appropriateness and reduce the use of inappropriate anticholinergic medications in elderly&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the Sanders-Brown Alzheimer's Disease Center (ADC) cohort.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening: Patients seen in the Sanders-Brown clinic as part of the ADC cohort will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility in our study by the ADC study coordinator and the licensed&#xD;
      prescriber involved in the scheduled ADC visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: If the patient is considered eligible based on the screening, the study&#xD;
      coordinator will introduce our study to the potential participant and will answer questions&#xD;
      the patient might have. If the patient is interested, the study coordinator will obtain the&#xD;
      informed consent and will proceed with the study related activities. Medication information&#xD;
      and SF-36 are collected as part of the ADC cohort data collection; therefore, to reduce the&#xD;
      burden on the participant, we are planning to work with the ADC team and use these data as&#xD;
      baseline information for our study. For participants randomized to the intervention group,&#xD;
      the two onsite study visits will be scheduled- the intervention visit will be planned within&#xD;
      a week after enrollment and the end of study visit will be scheduled 8 weeks after&#xD;
      enrollment. Participants randomized to the control group will have their end of study visit&#xD;
      scheduled 8 weeks post-enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, the study pharmacist will perform medication therapy management (MTM) to&#xD;
      review all medications from the list provided by the patient. The pharmacist will identify&#xD;
      any anticholinergic medication, will determine the medication appropriateness index and will&#xD;
      prepare a report to include information on potential inappropriate medications to make&#xD;
      recommendations for treatment discontinuation or change as considered appropriate. For&#xD;
      participants included in the intervention group, the pharmacist will discuss the&#xD;
      recommendations with one of the licensed prescribers before the scheduled visit by the&#xD;
      participant. Final recommendations on discontinuing or changing inappropriate medications&#xD;
      will be made by medical staff. In the case of medication necessity, safer alternatives will&#xD;
      be sought and will be included in the proposed plan to be discussed with the patient assigned&#xD;
      to the intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention visit: Those included in the intervention group will undergo an educational&#xD;
      session with the study pharmacist and one of the licensed prescribers from Sanders-Brown to&#xD;
      discuss recommended changes in their treatment plan. If changes in medications are indicated&#xD;
      by the pharmacist-prescriber team, and accepted by the patient, new prescriptions will be&#xD;
      provided and a letter will be sent to the primary care physicians detailing the changes made&#xD;
      and the rationale behind such changes. Sending a letter to the primary care provider to&#xD;
      inform of medication changes by the specialist is considered standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both intervention and control group will receive a generic brochure that describes medication&#xD;
      safety in the elderly in general terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study visit: At this visit, which will be scheduled eight weeks after enrollment, both&#xD;
      the intervention and control group will complete SF-36 and will update the data on their&#xD;
      current medication. They will also complete a questionnaire asking about their experience as&#xD;
      part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-visit evaluation: The study pharmacist will review the new medication list and the&#xD;
      follow-up MAI will be calculated through a similar procedure as detailed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-visit follow-up: All of the study participants will receive a thank you letter and will&#xD;
      be informed of the availability of the study team to further discuss their medication plan&#xD;
      and of the ADC prescribers to continue to support their ongoing care. The thank you letter&#xD;
      will also include a check to compensate participants for being part of our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The intervention will be based on the pharmacist-physician team drug review. For&#xD;
      patients randomized to the intervention group, the clinical pharmacist performed drug reviews&#xD;
      will guide a revised medication plan that will be discussed with the patient. Specifically,&#xD;
      the proposed plan will attempt to recommend discontinuation or replacement of any&#xD;
      inappropriate drug with anticholinergic properties, with safer drug alternatives (i.e., with&#xD;
      less or no anticholinergic activity). When drug alternatives are unavailable, reduction in&#xD;
      dosage will be attempted to reduce the anticholinergic burden. As part of their routine&#xD;
      clinical duties and care for ADC research participants, the prescribing team (ADC licensed&#xD;
      practitioners) will make the recommendations to the patient, while the study pharmacist will&#xD;
      be responsible for recommendations and provision of information to educate the patient about&#xD;
      medication safety and the importance of patient involvement in medication awareness and&#xD;
      oversight. Appropriate changes will be determined and carried out by the licensed prescriber&#xD;
      and a letter will be sent informing the primary care physician of medication changes and&#xD;
      rationale for such changes.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Anticholinergic Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The anticholinergic burden will be measured from baseline to follow-up, as measured by the anticholinergic drug scale (ADS).Anticholinergic burden (and change from baseline to follow-up) will be measure using the updated ADS score; the ADS has four levels for each included drug, ranging from 0 (no known anticholinergic activity) to 3 (markedly anticholinergic activity). The summation of anticholinergic activity level for all the drugs taken by a patient reflects the total anticholinergic burden.</description>
