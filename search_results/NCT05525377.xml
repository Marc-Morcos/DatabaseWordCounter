  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study on the effects of an online-based training and education&#xD;
      programme for carers of people with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), primary progressive&#xD;
      aphasia (PPA) and behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the feasibility of an online training course for carers of people with PCA, PPA,&#xD;
      and bvFTD. Feasibility measures will focus on the recruitment process and measurement tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the acceptability of an online training course for carers of people with PCA,&#xD;
      PPA and bvFTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 6 online modules over the course of 7 weeks. All sessions will take&#xD;
      place over the internet, using an online platform. A research team member (facilitator) will&#xD;
      be available to assist participants over the course completion.&#xD;
