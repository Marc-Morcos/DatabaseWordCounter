  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modifying health behaviors like physical activity level, diet, stress, and mental activity&#xD;
      level can lower risk for Alzheimer's disease, but many middle-aged and older adults find it&#xD;
      difficult to sustain health behavior changes over the long term. This project will develop a&#xD;
      new intervention that educates people about Alzheimer's disease risk factors and helps them&#xD;
      understand how their personal health beliefs may prevent them from making long-lasting&#xD;
      lifestyle changes. The goal is to help people sustain health behavior changes to prevent or&#xD;
      delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.&#xD;

    <description>The basic healthy living education intervention is a 24-session program (two sessions/week for 12 weeks) designed to educate participants about major modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. The first session each week is didactic, intended to increase knowledge about each Alzheimer's disease risk factor. The second session involves repetition and practice of didactic material as well as strategizing cues to action</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The enhanced healthy living education intervention will include the same didactic content as the basic HLE course for the first session each week. The second session will focus on personal health beliefs and how they affect specific health behaviors. This may include discussing perceived benefits, troubleshooting barriers to action, making specific action plans, and implementing natural reward systems to bolster self-efficacy.</description>
