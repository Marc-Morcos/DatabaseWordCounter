      The Aligning Medications with What Matters Most (ALIGN) study will assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of a deprescribing intervention to reduce medication regimen complexity&#xD;
      and treatment burden for people living with dementia (PLWD) and their care partners.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People living with dementia (PLWD) use more medications and have more complex medication&#xD;
      regimens than people without dementia. Medication regimen complexity is a major source of&#xD;
      burden for family caregivers of PLWD and has been associated with numerous adverse outcomes.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose a novel intervention, ALIGN: Aligning Medications with&#xD;
      What Matters Most, to optimize prescribing and reduce medication regimen complexity by&#xD;
      focusing on what matters most to the patient and caregiver, beyond rigid adherence to&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines. ALIGN is informed by learnings from OPTIMIZE, the investigator&#xD;
      team's patient-centered, pragmatic deprescribing intervention for PLWD in primary care that&#xD;
      is currently being prospectively evaluated. OPTIMIZE consists of a patient-level intervention&#xD;
      comprised of a deprescribing educational brochure, and a clinician-level intervention&#xD;
      comprised of a deprescribing educational session for primary care providers (PCPs),&#xD;
      deprescribing &quot;tip sheets&quot; and clinic-level feedback on rates of potentially inappropriate&#xD;
      medication prescribing in PLWD. ALIGN builds on OPTIMIZE by more explicitly addressing the&#xD;
      informational and decisional needs of caregivers through a shared decision making process&#xD;
      facilitated by clinical pharmacists. The investigators propose a pilot study to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of ALIGN in two different health care systems, and to identify&#xD;
      the most appropriate primary outcome measure for a subsequent embedded pragmatic trial&#xD;
      (ePCT). Target enrollment is 60 patient-care partner dyads. Patients will be aged â‰¥65 years&#xD;
      with dementia and &gt;5 chronic medications. Primary outcomes are intervention feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability among patients, care partners and PCPs; and feasibility of the patient-level&#xD;
      Medication Regimen Complexity Index and Family Caregiver Medication Administration Hassles&#xD;
      Scale at baseline and 3 months. Findings from this pilot study will guide the design,&#xD;
      implementation and subsequent evaluation of ALIGN in an ePCT, laying the groundwork to reduce&#xD;
      medication regimen complexity and burden for PLWD and their caregivers in diverse primary&#xD;
      care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed pragmatic intervention has the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of ALIGN in two different health&#xD;
      care systems, to guide the subsequent evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention in&#xD;
      an embedded pragmatic trial (ePCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the feasibility of the primary and secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      for the subsequent ePCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the feasibility of measuring the primary outcome, the patient-level&#xD;
           Medication Regimen Complexity Index (pMRCI), within the existing electronic health&#xD;
           record (EHR) systems, and to compare it with a more pragmatic measure, chronic&#xD;
           medication count, as the primary outcome measure for the ePCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the feasibility of measuring the secondary outcome, the Family Caregiver&#xD;
           Medication Administration Hassles Scale (FCMAHS), a caregiver-reported outcome measure.&#xD;

Proportion of participants with data elements available vs. unavailable to calculate the pMRCI.&#xD;
This study will assess the feasibility of measuring the pMRCI and not actually determining the pMRCI.&#xD;
The pMRCI is a validated, widely-used tool that measures medication regimen complexity to identify patients with expected difficulty managing their regimens. Scores are derived from weighted values of regimen components (eg, dosage formulations, frequencies, and specific instructions for use). Higher scores indicate greater medication regimen complexity.</description>

The FCMAHS is a validated caregiver-reported outcome measure that assesses burden associated with medication administration. The instrument consists of 24 items and four subscales: Information Seeking/Information Sharing (9 items), Safety Issues (5 items), Scheduling Logistics (7 items) and Polypharmacy (3 items). The total score range is 0-120 with higher scores indicating greater perceived hassle associated with managing some or all aspects of another person's medication regimen.</description>
