      The purpose of this study is to evaluate sleep quality in patients with mild to moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease treated with anticholinesterase drugs in clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an epidemiological (the study of health-related states or events in specific&#xD;
      populations) study of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's who have been treated&#xD;
      previously with anticholinesterase drugs (class of drugs that act in the central nervous&#xD;
      system) up to a maximum of fifteen days. The data for each patient will be recorded on two&#xD;
      occasions; first at a baseline visit and then at a follow-up visit at 3 months. At the&#xD;
      baseline visit, after the patient or his/her legal representative has given written informed&#xD;
      consent, each participating neurologist will use the study questionnaire to collect patient&#xD;
      sociodemographic characteristics (characteristics such as age, years of education, race, sex,&#xD;
      religion, birthplace, income, occupation, geographic location, among others), medical history&#xD;
      and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The neurologist will also record treatment for&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and concomitant hypnotic medications (simultaneous use of medications&#xD;
      that induce sleep) and evaluate the patient using two scales: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality&#xD;
      Index (PSQI) to record sleep disturbances and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to determine the&#xD;
      level of daytime sleepiness. Alzheimer treatment and concomitant hypnotic medications will be&#xD;
      recorded again at the follow-up visit. Patient sleep quality using the PSQI and daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness using the Epworth scale will also be evaluated again at this visit.&#xD;

    <measure>Sleep disturbances measures by Scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI consists of 19 self-rated questions which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over 1-month time interval. The 19 questions assess a wide variety of factors relating to sleep quality, including estimates of sleep duration and the frequency and severity of specific sleep-related problems. These 19 items are grouped into seven components scores, each weighted equally on a 0-3 scale. The seven components scores are then summed to yield a global PSQI score, which has a range of 0-21; higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Level of Daytime Sleepiness determined by the Scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale measures how likely, from 0 (would never take a nap) to 3 (high change of dozing), the patient is to doze off or fall asleep in common everyday situations. The scores for a total of eight questions are added together to obtain a single number. A number in the 0-9 range is considered to be normal while a number in the 10-24 range indicates that expert medical advice should be sought.</description>
