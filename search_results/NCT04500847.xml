    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial of a daily oral dose of 200 mg&#xD;
      emtricitabine vs. placebo in 35 participants with biomarker-confirmed MCI or mild to moderate&#xD;
      dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Study duration for each subject participating in the&#xD;
      placebo-controlled research study will be approximately 12 months (up to a 3 months Screening&#xD;
      Period, Baseline visit (1 month), 6 months of placebo or emtricitabine dosing, and 1 month&#xD;
      follow-up). Participants will have up to 2 months to complete all procedures for the month 6&#xD;
      study visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating and increasingly frequent neurological disorder&#xD;
      whose onset is strongly correlated with advanced age. Between 2000 and 2017 deaths from AD&#xD;
      have increased 145%, and AD has become the 6th leading cause of death in the USA.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, in spite of immense research and clinical efforts spanning several decades,&#xD;
      cures have been elusive. This has prompted searches for new mechanisms of disease and new&#xD;
      targets of therapy. One such direction is inflammation: aging and many age-associated&#xD;
      diseases are believed to be causally linked with a chronic inflammatory state. The brain is&#xD;
      no exception, and the presence of inflammation in the AD brain establishes an environment&#xD;
      that is hostile for the function and survival of neurons. While it is not yet clear whether&#xD;
      inflammation is the root cause of AD, it is increasingly believed that alleviating these&#xD;
      inflammatory processes might slow down the progression of the disease. This research study&#xD;
      will test to determine if the inflammatory state can be alleviated with a class of drugs&#xD;
      known as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). NRTIs were developed to treat&#xD;
      Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) caused by infection with Human Immunodeficiency&#xD;
      Virus (HIV). Investigators hypothesize that NRTI drugs, by inhibiting neuroinflammation, may&#xD;
      be effective in the treatment of AD. The primary goal of this trial will be to assess safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of Emtriva in a geriatric population of individuals diagnosed with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment or early AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD),&#xD;
      including subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Subjects must be positive for&#xD;
      amyloid pathology. Subjects must be 50 to 85 years old, and apart from the clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      of early AD, in good health as determined by the Investigator based on their medical history.&#xD;
      Participants must be HIV/HBV negative and pass all the screening assessments based on the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
