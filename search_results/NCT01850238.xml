  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-time-in-man study is mainly designed to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      AADvac1 in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AADvac1 is a vaccine directed against pathologically modified Alzheimer tau protein that is&#xD;
      the main constituent of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and is intended to be a&#xD;
      disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease, i.e. to halt its progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study is a Phase I study focused on tolerability and safety, efficacy will be&#xD;
      assessed in an exploratory manner.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AADvac1 is a candidate therapeutic vaccine for Alzheimer's disease that targets misfolded tau&#xD;
      protein, a common denominator of neurofibrillary pathology. Based on preclinical results, the&#xD;
      intervention is expected to reduce the number of neurofibrillary tangles, remove&#xD;
      hyperphosphorylated tau protein and reduce the amount of oligomerized and insoluble&#xD;
      pathological tau in the brain, to halt the spread of neurofibrillary pathology through the&#xD;
      brain, and thus prevent associated cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine's antigenic determinant is a synthetic peptide derived from a tau protein&#xD;
      sequence, which is coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and uses aluminum hydroxide&#xD;
      (Alhydrogel) as an adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present AADvac1 is intended as an active immunotherapy for patients with diagnosed&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients will receive 3 - 6 immunization doses; the raised titers&#xD;
      of therapeutic antibodies and possible benefits of the treatment can extend beyond the&#xD;
      duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the central role of pathological misfolded tau protein in the etiology of AD, the&#xD;
      vaccine is expected to be more effective than active or passive immunotherapies aiming to&#xD;
      eliminate the amyloid β plaques that have been clinically investigated so far.&#xD;
