  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To determine the effects of resveratrol extract given in a 215 mg dose in a daily&#xD;
      supplement currently available over the counter, on cognitive and global functioning in&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate AD on standard therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Many animal and in vitro studies have shown that resveratrol, a naturally&#xD;
      occurring polyphenol found in red wine, can increase cognition, reduce neural degeneration,&#xD;
      promote clearance of amyloid-beta peptides, and alter aging mechanisms. Therefore,&#xD;
      resveratrol may reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and possibly its pathology.&#xD;
      Objective: A pilot study to determine the effects of resveratrol on cognitive, behavioral and&#xD;
      global functioning in patients with mild-to-moderate AD on standard therapy. Design:&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants: 50 patients with&#xD;
      mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) defined as a Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) between&#xD;
      10-27 will be enrolled in the study. Patients must have an established diagnosis of AD by&#xD;
      NINCDS diagnostic criteria, be on stable dose of cognitive enhancing medications&#xD;
      (cholinesterase inhibitor and/or NMDA receptor antagonist) Screening/Enrollment:&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board approval will be obtained. The chart review and the enrollment&#xD;
      discussion will be carried out by a non-physician member of the research team. Participants&#xD;
      will be screened and randomized until a total of 50 eligible patients, 25 in each arm are&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Subject has provided full written informed consent prior to the performance of any&#xD;
             protocol-specified procedure; or if unable to provide informed consent due to&#xD;

             hormone (TSH) that is clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of Type 1 diabetes mellitus or secondary diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Type 2 diabetes mellitus where the subject is being treated with insulin, a PPARγ&#xD;

             females) or presence of hemoglobinopathies which would prevent accurate assessment of&#xD;
             HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Abnormal kidney function tests (&gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)).&#xD;

             &gt;1.5 times the ULN, or history of severe hepatobiliary disease (e.g. hepatitis B or C,&#xD;
             or cirrhosis, Child-Pugh Class B/C).&#xD;
