      PROACTS is a Phase I/II study to assess the efficacy of AARP Staying Sharp online health&#xD;
      program, focusing on the health of non-professional home-based caregivers of persons with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). PROACTS has three aims. Aim 1&amp;2 is an&#xD;
      one-time survey study to evaluate the current uptake and utilization of Staying Sharp among&#xD;
      caregivers. Aim 3 is a single-group intervention to assess how Staying Sharp may maintain&#xD;
      health and function for caregivers of persons with ADRD. Participants will participate in a&#xD;
      4-month program with a 4-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1&amp;2: Characterize caregivers of persons with ADRD using Staying Sharp and evaluate user&#xD;
      experiences of Staying Sharp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Establish preliminary efficacy of Staying Sharp program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significance: Approximately 16 million adults provide unpaid care to their loved ones with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD). Among caregivers, 1 in 3 are older adults.&#xD;
      For these caregivers, balancing their own health while caring for loved ones can be&#xD;
      stressful, depressing, and feelings of hopelessness. This long-term distress can lead to&#xD;
      higher risks of cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and mortality. Given the rise of incident&#xD;
      dementia and caregiving, scalable interventions to support family caregivers are urgently&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Staying Sharp is an online brain health intervention for older adults available&#xD;
      through AARP since 2018. Over 400,000 AARP members have registered for this online&#xD;
      intervention. This multi-component intervention includes a package of assessments, brain&#xD;
      games, and educational videos and articles to maintain 6-pillars healthy behaviors.&#xD;
      Independent of Staying Sharp, over 39 million have visited AARP's online caregiving resource&#xD;
      center. The large number of visits not only shows high demand for caregiver support, but&#xD;
      reveals the potential of Staying Sharp to reach tens of thousands of caregivers at greater&#xD;
      risk by their role for increased morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I/II user experience and efficacy study: While many users have registered for Staying&#xD;
      Sharp, its efficacy has not been tested. Home-sensing technology is an ecologically valid way&#xD;
      of testing the efficacy of health interventions. The Oregon Center of Aging &amp; Technology&#xD;
      (ORCATECH) has established a home-based, technology-agnostic, unobtrusive platform for more&#xD;
      than 15 years. With this platform, we will assess how Staying Sharp may maintain brain health&#xD;
      and function as indicated by a suite of digital biomarkers (e.g., physical activity, sleep,&#xD;
      dietary behaviors). Our ultimate goal is to refine Staying Sharp by examining user experience&#xD;
      and intervention efficacy and ultimately scale the program widely. To achieve this goal, we&#xD;
      are collaborating with AARP. The Specific Aims of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Characterize caregivers of persons with ADRD using Staying Sharp. We will send out a&#xD;
      survey to registrants of Staying Sharp. We hypothesize that caregiver users are younger,&#xD;
      predominantly women, with higher stress, and less social support than non-caregiver users.&#xD;
      This aim will clarify the demographics and basic health conditions of caregivers who have&#xD;
      been utilizing this online health intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate user experiences of Staying Sharp. We will use the same survey in aim 1 to&#xD;
      assess user experiences with a focus on the profile of sustainable use characteristics. We&#xD;
      hypothesize caregiver users will spend more time on stress and exercise pillars than&#xD;
      non-caregiver users. This aim will evaluate the engagement and uptake of Staying Sharp among&#xD;
      dementia caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Establish preliminary efficacy of Staying Sharp intervention. Using unobtrusive&#xD;
      home-sensing technologies, twenty newly-recruited caregivers of persons with ADRD will&#xD;
      participate in a 4-month intervention with 4 months follow-up. We hypothesize that Staying&#xD;
      Sharp will promote physical, mental, and social health for caregivers of persons with ADRD. A&#xD;
      non-linear dose-response curve will be used to determine the pre- to post-intervention&#xD;
      changes associated with Staying Sharp. This aim involves understanding interventions pointing&#xD;
      toward refinement, modification, and adaptation for caregivers and pilot testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROACTS uniquely takes an existing publicly available online health intervention and rapidly&#xD;
      tests its efficacy using a home-based, unobtrusive technology platform to provide&#xD;
      ecologically valid evidence of how this multi-component intervention may support health in&#xD;
      caregivers of persons with ADRD. The PROACTS study will lay the groundwork for later stage&#xD;
      (III/IV) effectiveness studies. Future grants (R01/PCORI) will bring together caregivers and&#xD;
      health stakeholders to evaluate elements within Staying Sharp for ensuring a high-quality,&#xD;
      high-impact, and scalable caregiver intervention.&#xD;

    <description>In the Staying Sharp online program, participants have the opportunity to select which health pillars they are most interested in improving (Be social, Engage your brain, Manage stress, Ongoing exercise, Restorative sleep, and Eat right). After selecting the health pillars, participants can set plans and goals. There are designated activities in each health pillar for participants to complete, including watch videos, read articles, or play games. Participants will follow a step-by-step guide to achieve these goals. The website tracks the status of these goals.&#xD;
Participants will use Staying Sharp program for 4 months. Research staff will call participants to encourage participants to use the program. Right after the completion of the 4-month program, we will send out a survey to understand user experiences. We will follow participants for another 4 months. After 4 months follow-up, an exit study survey will be conducted either via videoconferences or in-person visits.</description>
