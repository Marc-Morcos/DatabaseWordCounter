  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annovis is conducting a clinical study to investigate Posiphen in patients with Early&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Early Parkinson's Disease (PD). Investigators are looking to&#xD;
      recruit 68 patients in two parts of the study. In Part one of the study Investigators will&#xD;
      recruit 14 AD and 14 PD patients who will either receive placebo (an inert pill which looks&#xD;
      like the study drug) or the study drug Posiphen, both taken daily. In Part two of the study&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit 40 PD patients who will receive different strengths of the study&#xD;
      drug Posiphen taken daily. Patients will be required to come to the site for 3 face to face&#xD;
      visits and have 4 phone calls, tests include but are not limited to, blood and CSF (spinal&#xD;
      fluid) sampling, cognitive assessments, clinical examinations and laboratory safety tests.&#xD;
      Primarily the Investigators are looking for the safety and tolerability of Posiphen, although&#xD;
      Investigators will also evaluate the activity of Posiphen by a number of different biomarkers&#xD;
      measuring pathway and target engagements.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 is a study with 14 Early AD and 14 Early PD patients who are randomized to 80 mg of&#xD;
      Posiphen or placebo. Participants will undergo a Screening Visit, provide informed consent&#xD;
      and be evaluated for eligibility per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If enrolled,&#xD;
      participants will proceed to the randomized treatment portions of the study. Period 1&#xD;
      consists of first-time dosing in clinic with administration of 80 mg of Posiphen or Placebo.&#xD;
      Period 2 consists of an at home dosing period of 25±2 days, with daily administration of 80&#xD;
      mg of Posiphen or Placebo. Period 3 will be comprised of a stay at the clinical research unit&#xD;
      where the subject will undergo study procedures that include safety assessments (AE and&#xD;
      concomitant medication monitoring, 12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory testing, vital signs&#xD;
      assessments, and physical examinations), the last dose of Posiphen or Placebo, and 6 hours of&#xD;
      blood and CSF sampling. At the end of blood/CSF sampling, the subjects will need to stay for&#xD;
      a minimum of 1 hour of observation but may stay if necessary for observation until the&#xD;
      following day (e.g., if the subject has blood/CSF sampling on Day 25, he/she may stay for&#xD;
      observation until Day 26). After all end-of-study procedures are complete, the subject will&#xD;
      be discharged to home. A 24-hour follow-up call will occur to assess the participants current&#xD;
      condition and if there are any additional adverse events to report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of Part 1 of the study, the plasma and CSF samples will be analyzed for the&#xD;
      biomarkers to determine if changes are needed to the biomarkers to be measured in Part 2.&#xD;
      Since the conduct of the study in Part 2 will be identical to the conduct of the study in&#xD;
      Part 1, recruitment will continue uninterrupted. The only potential change between Part 1 and&#xD;
      Part 2 are the biomarkers to be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is a study with 40 Early PD patients, 10 patients each who are randomized to one of 4&#xD;
      treatment conditions of Posiphen (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg). Participants will undergo a&#xD;
      Screening Visit, provide informed consent and be evaluated for eligibility per the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria. If enrolled, participants will proceed to the randomized treatment&#xD;
      portions of the study. Period 1 consists of first-time dosing in clinic with administration&#xD;
      of 5, 10, 20, or 40mg of Posiphen. Period 2 consists of an at home dosing period of 25±2&#xD;
      days, with daily administration of 5, 10, 20, or 40mg of Posiphen. Period 3 will be comprised&#xD;
      of a stay at the clinical research unit where the subject will undergo study procedures that&#xD;
      include safety assessments (AE and concomitant medication monitoring, 12-lead ECGs, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory testing, vital signs assessments, and physical examinations), the last dose of&#xD;
      Posiphen or Placebo, and 6 hours of blood and CSF sampling. At the end of blood/CSF sampling,&#xD;
      the subject will need to stay for a minimum of 1 hour of observation but may stay if&#xD;
      necessary for observation until the following day (e.g., if the subject has blood/CSF&#xD;
      sampling on Day 25, he/she may stay for observation until Day 26). After all end-of-study&#xD;
      procedures are complete, the subject will be discharged to home. A 24-hour follow-up call&#xD;
      will occur to assess the participant's current condition and if there are any additional&#xD;
      adverse events to report.&#xD;

             major depression according to the criteria of the most current version of the&#xD;
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Mild depression or&#xD;

             micro or microhemorrhage as noted on the MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has cancer or has had a malignant tumor within the past year, except patients who&#xD;
             underwent potentially curative therapy with no evidence of recurrence. (Patients with&#xD;
             stable untreated prostate cancer or skin cancers are not excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Alcohol / Substance use disorder, moderate to severe, in the last 5 years according to&#xD;
             the most current version DSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational agent and have taken&#xD;
             at least one dose of study medication, unless unblinded on placebo, within 60 days&#xD;
             prior to the start of screening. (The end of a previous investigational trial is the&#xD;
             date the last dose of an investigational agent was taken), or five half-lives of the&#xD;
             investigational drug, whichever is greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects with infection or inflammation of the skin or skin disease at or in proximity&#xD;
             to the lumbar puncture site.&#xD;
