  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the READyR II Study is to test a dynamic tailoring phase of a remote&#xD;
      assessment for changing dementia-related care needs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unmet dementia-related care needs are highly prevalent, and are detrimental to the care&#xD;
      dyad's (person with dementia and their family care partner) health, safety, mortality, and&#xD;
      likelihood of nursing home placement. READyR II tests a dynamic tailoring phase of an&#xD;
      intervention program that was previously developed to remotely assess dementia-related care&#xD;
      needs using digital data on behavioral patterns (from sensors and wearables) in the home.&#xD;
      READyR II follows participants who have completed READyR for a total of six months in order&#xD;
      to detect anomalies in activity patterns that may indicate new and unforeseen care needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who voluntarily decide to participate in this follow-up intervention study will be&#xD;
      asked to continue participating with the in-home monitoring sensor platform, complete weekly&#xD;
      questionnaires, and receive regular follow-up telephone calls from the study team.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean difference effect sizes for pre-post change the care dyad's preparation for future care needs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline compared with 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Preparation for Future Care Needs Scale (Short Form) assesses the degree to which an individual has engaged in planning for future care needs in late life using 15 items and 5 subscales representing distinct planning processes (awareness, gathering information, decision making, concrete planning, avoidance). Items are scored on a 5 point Likert scale with higher scores indicating greater preparation for future care needs.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean difference effect sizes for pre-post change in the care dyad's relationship quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline compared with 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Dyadic Relationship Scale assesses the positive dyadic interactions and negative dyadic strain experienced by caregivers (11 items) and care recipients (10 items). Items are averaged for a summary score that ranges from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more positive interactions in the relationship, or more relationship strain, respectively.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean difference effect sizes for pre-post change in the amount of incongruence between the care partner's understanding of the care values of the person with dementia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline compared with 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Care Values Scale assesses the importance of four care-related values to the person with dementia from the perspectives of the person with dementia and their care partner. Items for each of the four subscales are averaged for a summary score that ranges from 1 to 3, with higher scores indicating greater importance of the care value to the person with dementia.&#xD;
