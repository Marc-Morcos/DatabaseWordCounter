    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, cross-over, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic PK/PD&#xD;
      study. (Part A)The PK portion of the study is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      ALZT-OP1 (a combination drug therapy) designated as ALZT-OP1a and ALZT-OP1b, in both plasma&#xD;
      and CSF, following co-administration of the two active investigational products, in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and Alzheimer subjects aged 55-79 and in good health. (Part B) The PD portion of&#xD;
      the study will evaluate the pharmacodynamics of ALZT- OP1, using both plasma and CSF&#xD;
      biomarkers, following 60 days of consecutive daily treatment, in AD subjects only.&#xD;

      This is a phase I/II randomized, open-label, cross-over, PK/PD study. The PK (Part A) portion&#xD;
      of the study is designed to evaluate both single and double doses of ALZT-OP-1a (17.1mg or&#xD;
      34.2 mg) and ALZT-OP1b (10 mg or 20 mg) in both Alzheimer's subjects and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      The PD (Part B) portion of the study is designed to evaluate single doses of ALZT-OP-1a&#xD;
      (17.1mg) and ALZT-OP1b (10 mg) in AD subjects treated for 60 days. An Alzheimer's control&#xD;
      group will be utilized for comparison to active treatment groups but will not be administered&#xD;
      study treatment; however, they will have biomarkers collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK (Part A) n=24, both healthy volunteers and AD subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is an open-label study, cross-over, PK study where 24 subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive treatment regimen A-B or B-A for two consecutive day of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the Phase 1 unit the morning before dosing and will initiate&#xD;
      dosing the following morning for 2 consecutive days of dosing (A-B, or B-A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 (A-B) will consist of a single inhaled oral dose of ALZT-OP1a via dry powder inhaler +&#xD;
      a single oral tablet dose of ALZT-OP1b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 (B-A) will consist of two oral inhaled doses of ALZT-OP1a, not more than 2 mins apart,&#xD;
      via dry powder inhaler + two oral tablets doses of ALZT-OP1b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 (B-A) will consist of two oral inhaled doses of ALZT-OP1a, not more than 2 mins apart,&#xD;
      via dry powder inhaler + two oral tablets doses of ALZT-OP1b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 (A-B) regimen consists of a single inhaled oral dose of ALZT-OP1a via dry powder&#xD;
      inhaler + a single oral tablet dose of ALZT-OP1b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AD subjects will be given the option to roll over into the PD portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD (Part B) n=32, AD subjects only&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is an open-label, PD study where 32 AD subjects will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either active treatment or be assigned to a non-treatment control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four (24) subjects will be randomly assigned to Treatment Group 1 to receive a single&#xD;
      (17.1 mg) inhaled dose of ALZT-OP1a plus a single (10 mg) oral dose of ALZT-OP1b daily for 60&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight (8) subjects will be randomly assigned to Treatment Group 2 (Control Group) and will&#xD;
      not be administered study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have plasma collected on Day 1, Day 30, and Day 60 and CSF collected on Day&#xD;
      1 and Day 60.&#xD;
