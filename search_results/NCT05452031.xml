  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial over 5 years, using Stage II of the NIH-defined stage&#xD;
      model for behavioral intervention development. We will evaluate the efficacy of the sleep&#xD;
      intervention program (Care2Sleep) on sleep, health status measures, and quality of life (for&#xD;
      dyads), and inflammation (for caregivers only). Eligible participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to in-person Care2Sleep, telehealth Care2Sleep, or to an in-person education control&#xD;
      group. The Care2Sleep programs and the control education program will consist of five&#xD;
      sessions. The intervention and control programs will begin after baseline assessment and&#xD;
      randomization. Posttreatment assessments will be performed immediately after the last session&#xD;
      and at 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
