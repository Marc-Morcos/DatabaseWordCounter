      This is a Phase 1/2a, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized, multiple&#xD;
      ascending dose (MAD) clinical trial to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      AL001. Up to 72 participants will be randomly assigned to receive study drug (active AL001)&#xD;
      or placebo. The study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 14-day treatment period, and a&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1/2a, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, multiple&#xD;
      ascending dose (MAD) clinical trial to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      of AL001, a crystal engineered lithium-salicylate-proline lithium delivery product that in&#xD;
      nonclinical studies was shown to enhance and prolong the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of&#xD;
      lithium in the brain with enhanced efficacy potential in Alzheimer's models compared to&#xD;
      lithium carbonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of approximately 72 participants will be enrolled. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive study drug (active AL001) or placebo in a ratio of 6:2, respectively,&#xD;
      with 8 patients in each dosing cohort. Cohorts 2a, 3a, 4a and 5a will involve 1:1 healthy&#xD;
      non-elderly and elderly subjects; cohorts 1, 2b, 3b, 4b and 5b will involve Alzheimer's&#xD;
      subjects. The study will consist of a screening period (Days -28 to -2), a 14-day treatment&#xD;
      period, and a 42-day follow-up period.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be randomized to receive AL001. When adequate safety data are available, a review will be done for all participants to make a dose-escalation or dose and/or regimen modification decision. This will be repeated for each cohort.&#xD;
A total of 9 cohorts will receive 5 different dose levels of AL001 in multiple ascending doses under fasted conditions up to tolerability/safety limits.&#xD;
Cohort 1 will include 8 AD subjects. In this cohort, 6 active and 2 placebo AD subjects (as per randomization code) will receive the following treatment or placebo:&#xD;
