  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how a part of the brain called the hippocampus&#xD;
      contributes to memory changes that occur with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memory problems are the most important early symptoms of AD. The hippocampal region of the&#xD;
      brain may be responsible for many age- and AD-related memory disorders. This study will use&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to examine the structure, chemical composition, and&#xD;
      function of the hippocampus in participants with AD, participants with mild memory problems,&#xD;
      participants who are healthy but are at risk for AD, and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will undergo MRI scans of the brain. During the MRI, participants&#xD;
      will perform memory tests to demonstrate hippocampal functioning.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The major focus of the Geriatric Psychiatry Branch (GPB) is the study of individuals with&#xD;
      memory disorders as a result of age or neurodegeneration. In particular, memory is the most&#xD;
      important earliest clinical symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the hippocampus may&#xD;
      not be a biological determinant of all memories, there is a growing body of evidence&#xD;
      suggesting that dysfunction of the hippocampus plays an important role in the most common&#xD;
      forms of memory disorders. This proposal will allow for the application of an array of newly&#xD;
      developed magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy methods to the study of hippocampal&#xD;
      function in these patients. Most importantly, for the first time, structure, perfusion and&#xD;
      neurochemical composition of the hippocampus in living individuals can be evaluated at high&#xD;
      resolution without known risk. The study of longitudinal changes in hippocampal function&#xD;
      should allow us to understand the contributions that various genotypes, e.g., ApoE4, and&#xD;
      abnormalities in cerebrospinal fluid, e.g., A-beta42 and tau, play in the development of&#xD;
      abnormal hippocampal structure and function.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be referred through the GPB screening protocol 95-M-0096:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. AD patients, diagnosis based on DSM-IV (APA Press, 1994) criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Individuals over the age of 50 who are &quot;at-risk&quot; for AD on the basis of having&#xD;
             first-degree relatives with AD and who tested within the normal range on a battery of&#xD;
             cognitive tests at the time of initial inclusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (memory problems significant enough to&#xD;
             concern the individual or members of the individual's family who do not meet the&#xD;
             criteria for AD),&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Control subjects, individuals without a positive family history of dementia in their&#xD;
             first degree relatives and who test within the normal range on the battery of&#xD;
             cognitive tests. As part of this screening process subjects who medical histories&#xD;
             significant for any medical condition that would make it unsafe to perform MRI scans&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXLCUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The same exclusion criteria used in those protocols for structural MRI and delineated under&#xD;
        Hazards and Precautions would again be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects participating in functional MRI scans will be required to be off prescription&#xD;
        medications which could effect these scans, such as medications with anticholinergic&#xD;
        effects, for two weeks-to one month prior to PET scan, and off psychotropic medication for&#xD;
        one month. Withdrawal from psychotropic medications for purposes of participation in this&#xD;
        protocol would only be considered for individuals already involved in the Longitudinal&#xD;
        Study Protocol 95-M-0096.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be cautioned not to consume alcohol, marijuana, or psychotropic drugs while&#xD;
        on the study, nor to smoke, use caffeinated beverages, or take over-the counter medications&#xD;
        such as cold medications (i.e.: benadryl, sudafed) for at least 12 hours prior to the&#xD;
        functional MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy test will be conducted prior to MRI scans on women of childbearing age.&#xD;
