  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The early detection of a preclinical AD or early stage of AD with amyloid imaging could&#xD;
      improve the diagnosis and provide knowledge for better therapeutical approach by combining&#xD;
      the best of imaging: structural MR sequences and newly FDA-approved biomarker for amyloid PET&#xD;
      imaging, all these two techniques with their strengths in one machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and Hypotheses can be summarized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess image quality and diagnostic performance of 18F-florbetapir (AMYVID) PET/MRI,&#xD;
           including direct comparison to corresponding PET/CT images of the same patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the incremental value of using 18F-florbetapir (AMYVID) in addition to&#xD;
           2-[F-18]-fluoro-2 deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) versus FDG alone. Does quantification of plaque&#xD;
           burden correlate with degree of neuronal degeneration as depicted by FDG as well as with&#xD;
           clinical severity?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine plaque burden quantitatively with 18F-florbetapir (AMYVID) in PET (form&#xD;
           PET/CT and from PET/MR) using novel software developed specifically for these brain&#xD;
           application; Computer-Aid Diagnosis for Dementia for amyloid imaging - CAD4D-amyloid&#xD;

    <description>The main effect that will be evaluated in this study is the ability of 18F-florbetapir (AMYVID) PET/MRI to assess the diagnosis of a patient, compared to both PET/CT and the diagnosis from the clinical record. Another effect that will be evaluated is if there is an added value when using 18F-florbetapir (AMYVID) in addition to 2-[F-18]-fluoro-2 deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) versus using only FDG in the evaluation of cognitive impairment patients.</description>

    <description>Patients will be included if presenting with the clinical suspicious of AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or other cognitive impairment to be further determined.&#xD;
Patients will undergo two doubles scans in two steps with a maximum of 2 week between both: the first step will be one day double scan with FDG imaged by PET-CT and PET-MRI; and the second step will be one day double scan with 18F-florbetapir imaged by PET-CT and PET-MRI at a different timepoints as shown in figure 1.</description>
