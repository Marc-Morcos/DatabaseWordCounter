  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using gene therapy to express active telomerase (hTERT) in human cells has the potential to&#xD;
      treat many neurodegenerative diseases related to aging, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will entail treating subjects with hTERT delivered via transduction using AAV. The&#xD;
      goal is to extend the telomeres to prevent, delay, or even reverse the development of the&#xD;
      pathology of AD. It is expected to have a direct consequence on cognitive function and&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with AD who meet with the inclusion - exclusion criteria, will be treated&#xD;
      with a single dose of LGT delivered intravenously (IV) and intrathecally (IT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline will be performed within 8 weeks of beginning the treatment regimen. The treatment&#xD;
      regimen will begin with IV delivery of AAV-hTERT, defined as &quot;Day 0.&quot; Safety and efficacy&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted at Weeks 1, 4, 13, 26, 39, and 52 post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Safety and Tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Investigate the safety and tolerability of AAV-hTERT by IV and IT administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Provisional Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate LGT's ability to deliver hTERT to human cells and lengthen telomeres.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the effects of lengthening telomeres on AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate other benefits provided by lengthening telomeres.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet the following inclusion criteria at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age of 45 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or early signs of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects, or their authorized representatives, must be adequately informed and&#xD;
             understand the nature and risks of the study and must be able to provide a signature&#xD;
             and date in the Informed Consent Form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women must undergo a negative serum pregnancy test at the screening assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects, or their representatives, must be able to communicate effectively with the&#xD;
             study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects, or their authorized representatives, must certify that they are able and&#xD;
             willing to follow all protocol requirements and study restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are not eligible for the study if they meet any of the following criteria at the&#xD;
        screening visit, unless otherwise specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who have a history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any&#xD;
