      This is a study to evaluate the impact of returning research results that indicate a&#xD;
      five-year risk estimate of Alzheimer disease dementia to participants without memory or&#xD;
      thinking problems of the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University in&#xD;
      St. Louis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants without memory or thinking problems in a longitudinal observational cohort&#xD;
      of aging (Memory and Aging Project) will be offered a five-year Alzheimer dementia risk&#xD;
      estimate report that incorporates genetic and neuroimaging research results as well as&#xD;
      demographic information into five-year Alzheimer disease dementia risk estimate. Using a&#xD;
      two-year delayed-start randomized clinical trial design, participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive research results either two weeks (Arm A) or one year (Arm B) after informed consent.&#xD;

    <description>Both Arms A and B will receive the same intervention, but at different time points. Both arms will be offered the option to learn their research results in personalized five-year risk estimate of getting Alzheimer disease dementia. Arm A participants will receive their risk estimate about two weeks after consent is signed and Arm B will receive their risk estimate about one year after consent is signed. The risk estimate returned to participants is based on research results from individual genotyping results, imaging testing and demographic characteristics. Both arms will complete psychosocial and cognitive testing. Also, surveys used in this study will ask about participants' experiences and feelings after learning participant's risk estimate. Arm A and Arm B will receive follow up surveys at one week post disclosure of the risk estimate, two months and six months post disclosure. Arm A will have extra surveys at fourteen and eighteen months post disclosure.</description>
