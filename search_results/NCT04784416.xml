  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to evaluate the dose-dependent effects of t-PBM in amnestic Mild&#xD;
      Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) (CDR of 0.5-1, FAST 1-3; age 65-85) in a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial of 8 weeks of t-PBM vs. sham. At screening, all subjects will complete initial&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing. To elucidate mechanisms of action of t-PBM, prior to treatment,&#xD;
      subjects will undergo neuroimaging related to critical features of AD: tau 18F MK-6240 load&#xD;
      (PET), measures of brain bioenergetics (31P-MRS), and functional connectivity (rs-fMRI).&#xD;
      Subjects will also undergo an open label t-PBM session performed during fMRI to detect BOLD&#xD;
      changes with t-PBM. Subjects will then be randomized to t-PBM/sham and complete treatments in&#xD;
      two participating centers (NYU/NKI acting as a single center, and MGH), ~10 min per day, 3&#xD;
      days per week, for 8 weeks. t-PBM will be administered via pulsed, 808nm wavelength laser&#xD;
      delivery to the forehead bilaterally (at standard EEG electrode positions F4, F3).&#xD;

    <description>Trails Making Test (Trails) is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. Both parts of the Trail Making Test consist of 25 circles distributed over a sheet of paper. In Part A, the circles are numbered 1-25, and the patient should draw lines to connect the numbers in ascending order. In Part B, the circles include both numbers (1-13) and letters (A-L); as in Part A, the patient draws lines to connect the circles in an ascending pattern (alternating numbers and letters). The time it takes to connect the &quot;trail&quot; is recorded.&#xD;
Reported as B - A. Range = 0 - 100+ (measured in seconds). A higher B - A score indicates poorer performance.</description>
