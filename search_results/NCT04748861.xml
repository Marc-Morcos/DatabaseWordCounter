  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the CYCLE-AD trial is to determine the role of long-term, high intensity&#xD;
      exercise in slowing or delaying the onset of cognitive and AD-related brain changes in e4&#xD;
      carriers. Successful translation and demonstration of the effectiveness of a scalable&#xD;
      home-based exercise intervention capable of slowing or delaying disease onset will transform&#xD;
      AD treatment, improve patient outcomes and quality of life, and reduce health care costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE e4) allele is the most important genetic risk factor for&#xD;
      late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent review by the World Health Organization&#xD;
      highlighted the potential protective role of physical activity and exercise against cognitive&#xD;
      decline, all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular dementia in healthy individuals. In an 18-month&#xD;
      longitudinal observational study, investigators showed that sedentary e4 carriers experience&#xD;
      significant declines in episodic memory and hippocampal volume compared to 4 carriers who&#xD;
      engaged in moderate PA. Importantly, among 4 non-carriers, no significant longitudinal&#xD;
      changes in cognition and brain imaging were observed whether the non-carriers were sedentary&#xD;
      or engaged in moderate PA, suggesting that PA has a specific neuroprotective role in delaying&#xD;
      the progression of AD in e4 carriers. Based on the results, a pragmatic, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with blinded clinical and imaging outcomes is proposed to determine the&#xD;
      impact of a home based, high intensity exercise intervention in healthy, cognitively intact&#xD;
      e4 carriers between the ages of 65 and 80 years. The CYCLE-AD (CYcling to Cease or Limit the&#xD;
      Effects of Alzheimer's Disease) trial will recruit otherwise healthy sedentary carriers&#xD;
      randomized to one of two groups (n=75 each): 1) an Indoor Cycling (IC) group that&#xD;
      participates in high-intensity interval training (HIIT; 60-90% of heart rate reserve) in&#xD;
      their home via the commercially available Peloton® cycling system or 2) a Usual and Customary&#xD;
      Care (UCC) group, in which participants engage in their habitual level of PA. Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that an 18-month high-intensity aerobic exercise regimen will slow AD-related&#xD;
      disease progression in sedentary elders at genetic risk for AD. Participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group will engage in exercise 3x/week (minimum 90 minutes/week) for 18 months.&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures, obtained at study entry and at 18 months, will include&#xD;
      comprehensive cognitive testing and brain MR imaging to assess disease progression and a&#xD;
      comprehensive PA/fitness assessment to measure the degree of change in physical fitness due&#xD;
      to high intensity aerobic exercise.&#xD;
