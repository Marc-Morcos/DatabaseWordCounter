  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this exploratory pilot study is to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      adapted T&amp;E home-based exercise program on the basic functional mobility and executive&#xD;
      functions in persons with mild or probable Alzheimer's Disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at T0 (one week before the begin of the&#xD;
      intervention) and T1, (one week after the eight weeks of the intervention) at home of the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight home-based physiotherapy sessions will occur in two months, once a week, to activate&#xD;
      the preserved implicit memory (PIM). The recommendations are to train three weeks with the&#xD;
      same exercise program, three times a week (one time coached by the attributed physiotherapist&#xD;
      and two times coached by a natural or family caregiver). After three weeks, the participants&#xD;
      can choose if they want to keep the same exercises or change all or some of these, in testing&#xD;
      other tasks. Every training session will be planned to last 45 minutes. During each training&#xD;
      session, the participant will note on his/her own &quot;Training booklet&quot; each task performed. The&#xD;
      &quot;Training booklet&quot; will be used to plane, organize, and remember details for the next&#xD;
      training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve participants will take part at this study.&#xD;
