    <measure>changes in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; week-2, moth-3, month-6, month-9 and 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in MoCA will constitute assess response to rTMS the secondary research outcome measure used to.MoCA was developed by Nasreddine et al. based on clinical experience and reference to the MMSE cognitive items and scores, and the final version was finalized in November 2004. We adopted a localized version (Mandarin version#includes 2 alternative versions) in line with the Chinese cultural background.It includes 11 inspection items in 8 cognitive fields, including visual structure skills, executive function, naming, attention and calculation, language, abstract thinking, memory, and orientation. With a total score of 30 or more than 26, it is normal. Anyone who has been education for less than 12 years will need to add one point to his final score. The final score of the higher the better, and we hope the subjects' scores will improve after treatment.</description>

    <measure>The changes in MMSE(Mini Mental State Examination)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; week-2, moth-3, month-6, month-9 and 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in MMSE will constitute the secondary research outcome.The full name of MMSE is mini-mental state examination, and the scale consists of 30 subject, include the following seven aspects: time orientation, place orientation,immediate memory,attention and calculation,delay memory,language, visual space.One point is awarded for each question correctly answered during MMSE evaluation. If subject give the wrong answer or don't know answe he/ she awarded 0 score, scope of scale score of 0 to 30 points. The higher the score, the better. In this study, changes in MMSE scores before and after treatment were used as secondary observations,we hoped that scores would increase after treatment.</description>

    <measure>HAMD (Hamilton Depression Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; week-2, moth-3, month-6, month-9 and 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in HAMD will constitute the secondary research outcome. Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) compiled by Hamilton in 1960, is the most common clinical to assess Depression Scale. In this study, 17 versions were selected, and there were 17 questions. The subjects were assessed for their depression in the past week. Each question scored between 0 and 4 points.Higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms. The severity of the disease and the therapeutic effect can be evaluated after treatment. In this study, we hoped that scores would decrease after treatment.</description>

    <measure>HAMA (Hamilton Anxiety Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; week-2, moth-3, month-6, month-9 and 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in HAMA will constitute the secondary research outcome. Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) was compiled by Hamilton in 1959.It was one of the most commonly used scales in psychiatric clinic, including 14 items. It is often used in clinical diagnosis and degree classification of anxiety disorder. The subjects were assessed for their anxiety in the past week. Each question scored between 0 and 4 points. The higher the score, the more symptoms of anxiety.&#xD;
The severity of the disease and the therapeutic effect can be evaluated after treatment. In this study, we hoped that scores would decrease after treatment.</description>

    <measure>NPI (Neuropsychiatric Inventory)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; week-2, moth-3, month-6, month-9 and 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The changes NPI will constitute the secondary research outcome. The Neuropsychology Scale (NPI) evaluates 12 neuropsychiatric disorders which included 10 neuropsychiatric symptoms and 2 autonomic neurological symptoms based on the caregiver's perception of the patient's behavior and the perceived distress. Each item was evaluated for its occurrence frequency (1-4 points) and severity (1-3 points). The frequency and severity were multiplied to obtain the score (0-12 points) of each item.The patient's assessment rating ranges from 0 to 144, and the caregiver's distress rating score is 0 to 60. The lower the score, the lighter the symptoms, and we expect the score to go down after treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline; week-2, moth-3, month-6, month-9 and 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The changes ADL will constitute the secondary research outcome. The ADL evaluates 20 items activities of daily living which included basic life ability and instrument use ability based on the caregiver's perception of the patient's behavior. Each item was evaluated for its severity (1-4 points). The patient's assessment rating ranges from 20 to 80, and the lower the score, the lighter the symptoms, and we expect the score to go down after treatment.</description>

    <measure>DST (Digital Span Test; Forward and Backward)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; week-2, moth-3, month-6, month-9 and 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in DST will constitute the secondary research outcome. Digital span test (DST) was commonly used to evaluate attention ability and instantaneous memory ability. There are two types of test: forward(0-14) and backward(0-13).In the forward test, the subjects were asked to retell the the digits immediately after hearing it until they could not be repeated correctly.In backward test, the subjects were asked to repeat a set of numbers in reverse order until they could not be repeated correctly. The length of the last set of Numbers correctly repeated by the subjects was the final score, forward and backward are counted separately. The higher the score, the better. In this study, we hoped that scores would increase after treatment.</description>

    <measure>JLOT(Judgment of line Judgment of line orientation test orientation test)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; week-2, moth-3, month-6, month-9 and 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in JLOT (Judgment of line Judgment of line orientation test orientation test) will constitute assess response to rTMS the secondary research outcome measure.The JLOT test was determined by Benton et al. in 1994.&#xD;
There are two versions of H and V. The difference is that the order in which the pictures are presented is different.&#xD;
Each version contains 35 images, of which the official test consists of 30 images, and the other 5 images are for the participants to learn. The final score is the correct number of subjects to answer, the full score is 30 points, the higher the score, the better the space perception ability of the subject.We hope the subjects' scores will improve after treatment.</description>
