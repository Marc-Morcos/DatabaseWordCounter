  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, feasibility study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and initial effectiveness of opening of the Blood-Brain Barrier with intravenous contrast&#xD;
      agents using the ExAblate Neuro System in patients with early stage Alzheimer's Disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single-arm, non-randomized, feasibility, phase I trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of focal BBB opening using the ExAblate® Transcranial (220 kHz) system&#xD;
      and Definity® ultrasound contrast in 6 patients with mild Alzheimer's Disease. This phase I&#xD;
      trial will be divided into two stages. In the first stage, patients will undergo small volume&#xD;
      BBB opening, establishing the minimum required sonication parameters to open the BBB, as&#xD;
      evidenced by gadolinium enhancement on T1-weighted MRI. Stage I is defined as a discrete&#xD;
      region of approximately 9 mm x 9 mm area in the right frontal lobe. Multiple sonications will&#xD;
      be performed starting at low energy and ramping up until the BBB is observed to open. The&#xD;
      subjects will then be removed from the ExAblate® Neuro device and followed for safety for 30&#xD;
      days. If the subject experienced BBB opening without any serious adverse effects (such as&#xD;
      brain edema), then the subject may proceed to Stage two where a larger volume (2.5-3.0 cm)&#xD;
      will be targeted. Subjects will be followed for an additional 60 days for safety and&#xD;
      preliminary effectiveness.&#xD;
