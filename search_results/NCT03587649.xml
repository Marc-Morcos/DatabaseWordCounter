      The primary objective of this protocol is to examine [18F]MNI-1126 as a tool to assess&#xD;
      synaptic density loss.The specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine [18F]MNI-1126 as a tool to assess synaptic density loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the dynamic uptake and washout of [18F]MNI-1126 in the brain using positron&#xD;
           emission tomography (PET) in subjects with AD, PD, and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure blood metabolites of [18F]MNI-1126 and perform kinetic modeling to assess its&#xD;
           ability to measure synaptic density loss in the brain using the tracer plasma&#xD;
           concentration or a reference region as indirect input.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To acquire safety data following injection of [18F]MNI-1126.&#xD;
