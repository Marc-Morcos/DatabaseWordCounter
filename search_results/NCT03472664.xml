    <textblock>
      The Brain Energy for Amyloid Transformation in AD (Alzheimer's disease) or BEAT-AD study will&#xD;
      compare the effects of a ketogenic low-carbohydrate diet and a low-fat diet in adults with&#xD;
      mild cognitive impairment. The data collected will help determine whether diet interventions&#xD;
      induce changes in cognitive function, cerebral blood flow, and levels of certain proteins and&#xD;
      hormones in body fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include volunteers who have mild cognitive impairment, who will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either a ketogenic low-carbohydrate diet or a low-fat diet for 16-weeks,&#xD;
      with follow-up assessment 8 weeks after diet completion. Study measures, clinic visits and&#xD;
      phone sessions will occur at baseline and throughout the 24-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will include volunteers who have mild cognitive impairment. This group will complete&#xD;
      a 16-week low-fat diet study, with follow-up assessment 8 weeks after diet final completion.&#xD;
      Study measures, clinic visits and phone sessions will occur throughout the 24-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will follow either a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet that will be individually&#xD;
      planned with help from a study dietitian. After completing the study diet for 16 weeks,&#xD;
      participants will resume their normal diet. The final visits will occur at week 24 (8 weeks&#xD;
      after the completing the diet). At the end of the 24-week study, participants will be given&#xD;
      the opportunity to meet with the study dietitian for education and assistance with planning a&#xD;
      healthy diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of a 4-month Modified Mediterranean-Ketogenic Diet&#xD;
      compared with an American Heart Association Diet (AHAD - a regimen that has been shown to&#xD;
      reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease). We will investigate diet effects on AD&#xD;
      biomarkers, on cognition, and on neuroimaging measures of blood flow. Our study will extend&#xD;
      previous findings in several important ways by: 1) using a Modified Mediterranean-Ketogenic&#xD;
      Diet rather than a traditional Ketogenic Diet, which has the potential for greater long-term&#xD;
      compliance and health benefits; 2) increasing the sample size and duration of the diet&#xD;
      intervention; 3) examining potential mechanisms of diet effects that may result in new&#xD;
      biomarkers and therapeutic targets; and 4) examining key treatment response variables such as&#xD;
      Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype, amyloid positivity and metabolic status that could inform&#xD;
      precision medicine approaches to dietary prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will be randomized on a 1:1 schedule to&#xD;
      receive either a 4-month Modified Mediterranean-Ketogenic Diet (MMKD) or American Heart&#xD;
      Association Diet (AHAD) intervention. Diet interventions will be equicaloric with&#xD;
      participants' normal diets. Personalized nutritional guidance and menus will be provided, and&#xD;
      compliance will be assessed by a registered dietitian. The principal investigator will be&#xD;
      responsible for the overall monitoring of the data and safety of study participants, with&#xD;
      assistance by members of the study staff, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB),&#xD;
      which will be responsible for monitoring the safety of research participants.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment will be randomized on a 1:1 schedule to receive either a 4-month Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet or American Heart Association Diet intervention. Diet interventions will be equicaloric with participants' normal diets. Personalized nutritional guidance and menus will be provided, and compliance will be assessed by a registered dietitian. Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) will be conducted at baseline. Blood collection and cognitive assessment will be conducted at baseline and after 2 and 4 months of diet. Lumbar puncture (LP) and MRI will be conducted at baseline and following the intervention for all participants.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PACC consists of Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test - Total Recall, Logical Memory IIa - Delayed Paragraph Recall, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, MMSE - Total Score and Category Fluency.&#xD;
Although the PACC was designed for use with preclinical AD, it is reasonable to assume it will also be sensitive in aMCI, as all PACC components are frequently used in aMCI studies. According to PACC developer, Reisa Sperling, MD, it is a useful indicator of cognitive change in aMCI in the Harvard Aging Brain Study (personal communication). Further, we observed significant improvement in our cognitive test composite that includes 2 PACC components following the MMKD.</description>
