  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting almost 6% of the world's&#xD;
      population over the age of 65. This disease, in its most typical sporadic form, is&#xD;
      characterized by an episodic memory impairment linked to a deficit in consolidation. Many&#xD;
      studies indicate that sleep promotes this consolidation stage during the deep slow sleep&#xD;
      stage by facilitating the transfer of information between the hippocampus and the neocortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A method of acoustic brain stimulation at night by pink noises has been recently developed&#xD;
      and has shown its effectiveness in strengthening memory consolidation in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      Actually, there is no study observing the effect of this new stimulation method on&#xD;
      populations with neurodegenerative pathologies, in particular in AD for which this technique&#xD;
      could potentially become a therapeutic option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that of a strengthening of the memory consolidation capacities in subjects&#xD;
      with AD as has been shown in healthy subjects.&#xD;
