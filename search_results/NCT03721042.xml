  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators don't know yet how the nose and the brain decode the smells. Scientific&#xD;
      studies in neuroscience have shown that people who have tumors may have changes in the smell&#xD;
      of secretions. Dogs are extremely efficient at detecting these changes, even before imaging&#xD;
      studies. A review of the recent literature shows the different work done on the diagnosis of&#xD;
      dogs on human pathologies, especially oncology. It is now known that the smell of exhaled&#xD;
      gases is representative of the intestinal biotope and that a large number of pathologies are&#xD;
      related to the type of microbial populations that inhabit the intestines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copying the olfactory organs could thus be of major interest for the early diagnosis of&#xD;
      pathologies. More and more works are interested in the diagnostic power of electronic noses.&#xD;
      From a technical point of view, these are nano-sensors that mimic the olfactory receptors&#xD;
      from the breath gas of the subjects. They analyze the molecules present and compare them with&#xD;
      a database to establish a diagnosis according to a probabilistic algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of exhaled air for the diagnosis of cancerous pathologies has already been the&#xD;
      subject of scientific work. A classification using the SVM (support vector machine) method&#xD;
      using data from 320 sensors made it possible to differentiate patients with lung cancer from&#xD;
      controls in 98.8% of cases. The differential diagnosis of obstructive bronchopneumopathy was&#xD;
      also very well done in this same study. Another study shows equally encouraging results,&#xD;
      highlighting sensitivities and specificities above 80%.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have signed the free and informed consent form or their guardian if&#xD;
             applicable. If the state of health of the patient does not allow him to give and sign&#xD;
             his consent, it will be sought from the person of trust&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be an affiliate or beneficiary of a health insurance plan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is at least 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient participates or has participated within 3 months in another study that may&#xD;
             have modified their intestinal biotope&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is in an exclusion period determined by a previous study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is under the protection of justice&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient or guardian or trusted person refuses to sign the consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient does not read the French language fluently&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient claims to be pregnant&#xD;
