      multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,placebo-controlled study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability, efficacy, and PK of 60 mg AD-35 administered QD during 6 months&#xD;
      of double-blind treatment followed by a second 6 months of open-label treatment to subjects&#xD;
      with mild to moderate AD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Approximately 55 subjects are planned to be enrolled for the entire study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized on Day 1 via a centralized interactive response technology (IRT) in a 1:2 ratio to&#xD;
      receive placebo or 60 mg AD-35. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety&#xD;
      information after the first 30 subjects have completed the Day 30 Visit and make any&#xD;
      necessary recommendations regarding changes to the conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first 6 months of double-blind treatment, subjects initially on placebo will&#xD;
      transition to active study drug, and all subjects will receive 60 mg AD-35 for an additional&#xD;
      6 months of open-label treatment.&#xD;
