      The TIPS Study, or Treatment and Illness Perceptions Survey, is a study funded by the&#xD;
      national Alzheimer's Association to learn more about differences between African Americans'&#xD;
      and Whites' attitudes, beliefs, and experiences related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The&#xD;
      study involves a one-time 30-minute telephone survey in which participants are asked about a&#xD;
      range of topics related to AD, including their personal experiences, their beliefs about the&#xD;
      disease's symptoms and risk factors, and their attitude toward possible future treatment&#xD;
      options. Information from the survey will be used to develop more culturally sensitive health&#xD;
      education and healthcare services for persons with AD.&#xD;

      The main goal of the Boston University's TIPS II project is to examine differences in&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) illness perceptions between African Americans and Whites in order to&#xD;
      better understand attitudes and beliefs and to develop more culturally sensitive health&#xD;
      services for AD. This 30-minute telephone survey will include a total of 140 first-degree&#xD;
      relatives and caregivers of people with AD, as well as a comparison group of 70 adults&#xD;
      without family history. The researchers will assess 1) beliefs about AD; 2) the perceived&#xD;
      threat it poses; 3) sources of information about AD; 4) knowledge of basic facts about AD; 5)&#xD;
      appraisal of AD treatments; and 6) intentions regarding current and emerging care options.&#xD;
      Based on preliminary data, this study hypothesize that, as compared to Whites, African&#xD;
      Americans will report lower levels of perceived threat, fewer sources of information, less&#xD;
      awareness of facts, and less interest in care options. Focus group interviews with African&#xD;
      American participants will help interpret study findings and inform recommendations for&#xD;
      health education interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings will inform the development of a set of recommendations for AD health educators that&#xD;
      will help them tailor their interventions to African Americans. Such educational programs&#xD;
      promote increased use of assessment, treatment, and caregiver assistance services. Results&#xD;
      will also be used as pilot data in a proposal for a national survey of caregivers and&#xD;
      relatives. This program of research will address a growing need for increased understanding&#xD;
      of beliefs, knowledge, and intentions regarding AD. A total of 210 participants are being&#xD;
      sought (105 African Americans, and 105 Whites). Participants who complete the survey will be&#xD;
      given a $10.00 check, plus informational brochures on AD and the latest newsletter from the&#xD;
      Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center.&#xD;
