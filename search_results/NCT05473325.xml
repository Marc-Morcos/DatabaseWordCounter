      This research programme seeks to combine the resources of NHS primary care, with the leading&#xD;
      spectroscopic work in low-magnetic fields of the Wilson Group (Nottingham Trent University)&#xD;
      to demonstrate the potential for benchtop Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in&#xD;
      human clinical pathology. This is an instrument assessment study for point of care viability&#xD;
      which will also result in enhanced patient care (pending their consent) in blood screenings&#xD;
      and metabolic health data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research project aims to gauge the efficacy of benchtop Nuclear Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      devices in a primary health care setting. The study design and methodology is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically, before a patient attends their routine standard of care blood test, they will&#xD;
      speak with their local General Practitioner (GP) or a Registered Nurse (RN). At these visits,&#xD;
      the medical professional will gauge the interest of the patient and test if they are&#xD;
      eligible. If the patient is interested in becoming involved with research, and they are&#xD;
      eligible for the study, they will be given a 'Study Information and Informed Consent Form' to&#xD;
      read before their next visit. This allows for ample time to become fully informed on what the&#xD;
      study entails, as well as to ask any questions they may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Study Information and Informed Consent Form' document contains all information&#xD;
      detailing: the purpose of the study, the significance of the research, and the patient's&#xD;
      right to withdraw at any time (as in accordance with General Data Protection Regulations&#xD;
      [GDPR] 2018), potential risks and benefits of taking part in the study and who to contact if&#xD;
      the patient had any further questions to be asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the patient's routine standard of care visit, they will present their signed and dated&#xD;
      consent form to the medical professional taking the biological samples. If the patient loses&#xD;
      their consent form before this visit, they will be given another to complete in full before&#xD;
      any residual biological samples are taken. This will be counter-signed by the medical&#xD;
      professional present at their visit. The patient will then be anonymised by being given a&#xD;
      unique identifier in the form of a barcode. This barcode will be applied to the consent form,&#xD;
      and the form will act as a linking document. The patient will only be referred by their&#xD;
      unique identifier for the remainder of the study. This anonymisation of identifiable patient&#xD;
      information (such as name, Date of Birth [DoB], etc.) extends to any data produced by&#xD;
      analysing the patient's samples. The patient will keep a copy of the consent form for their&#xD;
      own records, whilst the original document will be held by the research team to be stored&#xD;
      on-site behind several layers of security. A copy of the consent form will also be uploaded&#xD;
      onto the patients SystmOne profile. SystmOne is a clinical computer system used by medical&#xD;
      professionals to log patient visits, review tests results and upload any new relevant data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After sample collection, no further actions are required of the patient for the remainder of&#xD;
      the study. The patient will be given a debriefing document thanking them for their&#xD;
      contribution. Within this document there are contact details of the researchers involved and&#xD;
      other contact telephone numbers to a variety of organisations and helplines specialising in&#xD;
      emotional support, if the patient feels in any way affected by the study. The patient will&#xD;
      also be offered the opportunity to be given a copy of their bio fluid spectral data should&#xD;
      they be interested in this. This will be accompanied by explanatory notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological samples collected from the patient will go to two different locations: samples&#xD;
      taken as part of the patient's routine standard of care will go to a local diagnostics lab&#xD;
      where they will be tested on a variety of metrics. Residual biological samples will be&#xD;
      processed and tested at the local Willows Health Near Patient Testing laboratory, before&#xD;
      being frozen at -80oC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test results provided by the diagnostics lab will be uploaded to the patient's SystmOne&#xD;
      account, where they will be scribed and used for the study, as outlined in the 'Study&#xD;
      Information and Informed Consent Form' document. Results gathered from the Willows Health&#xD;
      Near Patient Testing laboratory will also be uploaded to the patients SystmOne account and&#xD;
      stored for later use within the study. The combination of these two sets of data will form&#xD;
      the Near Patient Testing data set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The residual biological samples frozen at Willows Health will then be transferred in batch&#xD;
      format to Nottingham Trent University's (NTU's) benchtop Nuclear Magnetic Resonance device.&#xD;
      They will then be thawed, prepared further and analysed using the benchtop Nuclear Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance device. The resultant spectra will be stored on the password protected device to&#xD;
      form the benchtop Nuclear Magnetic Resonance data set. With both sets of data gathered (Near&#xD;
      Patient Testing suite and benchtop Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectra), a machine learning&#xD;
      algorithm will cross-compare the data sets to 'teach' a program to 'read' the benchtop&#xD;
      Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectra and output data in the form of Near Patient Testing&#xD;
      machines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On average, ~42 patients attend the Willows Health Medical Centre for routine standard of&#xD;
      care visits per week in which biological samples are collected for pathology lab testing.&#xD;
      This equates to ~168 samples per month. With the sample collection window planned to take a&#xD;
      year, this calculates to ~2016 potential participants being involved within the study. This&#xD;
      is an estimated maximum, as not all patients who come for their annual review may not consent&#xD;
      to the research study. Additionally, some religious events and holidays may limit the uptake&#xD;
      of potential participants, for example: during Ramadan, although it is not strictly&#xD;
      prohibited, blood tests may be avoided due to the weakening effect it may have. This, in&#xD;
      conjunction with fasting, may dissuade potential participants from joining the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the substantial volumes of data required to 'train' software when utilising machine&#xD;
      learning algorithms, the sample size needs to be large. This is imperative to produce&#xD;
      accurate and reliable results from training and test sets for machine learning algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will result in several advantages for both clinical care and patients. For&#xD;
      instance, efficient and rapid analysis of biological fluids will help to overcome the&#xD;
      limitations associated with diagnosis of a variety of diseases such diabetes, chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease, cancer and any other conditions that might go asymptomatic in the early stages. This&#xD;
      work has the potential to pave the way for new clinical pathological techniques to support&#xD;
      the early diagnosis of diseases.&#xD;
