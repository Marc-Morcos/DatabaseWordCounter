  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are doing this research study to find out if methylphenidate (MPH) can help&#xD;
      people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or mild dementia likely due to Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug MPH is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat&#xD;
      Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but MPH is not approved by the FDA to treat&#xD;
      Mild Cognitive Impairment or mild dementia related to Alzheimer's Disease. However, other&#xD;
      studies have been done in which MPH has been given to people with neurodegenerative dementias&#xD;
      and results have shown some improvement in these people's mood and cognition. Investigators&#xD;
      would like to see if MPH will help mood and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place completely virtually (with the option to come in for the first&#xD;
      visit to meet the study team). All study visits will occur over a secure videoconferencing&#xD;
      platform. All study materials will be shipped directly to the home of each participant.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will give participants a supply of study drug. Participants will take the study&#xD;
      drug by mouth once a day for 16 weeks. It is important for participants to follow our&#xD;
      instructions about how to take the study drug. Participants can take the drug with or without&#xD;
      food. Investigators will provide enough study drug for participants to take until the next&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly Tasks During the study, certain tasks must be done each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every Day:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tasks must be done each day throughout the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wear the Fitbit activity tracker&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six Days per Week:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tasks will be completed six days per week:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete Lumosity cognitive games&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Use Lumosity to rate daily mood and sleep quality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Synchronize Fitbit to study provided iPad tablet (if requested)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once every five days:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following activities must be done approximately every five days throughout the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Charge Fitbit during a time when the subject is resting but not sleeping&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will periodically log into both the Fitbit dashboard and the Lumosity&#xD;
      account to check the battery level of the Fitbit, ensure the Fitbit is synching to the Fitbit&#xD;
      dashboard, and monitor the completion of Lumosity cognitive exercises.&#xD;
