    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects CST-2032 administered with CST-107 on cognition in subjects with Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (MCI) or mild dementia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled in a 2 period, 2-way crossover design following&#xD;
      study eligibility confirmation during the screening period. During each treatment period,&#xD;
      subjects will receive daily doses of CST-2032 administered with CST-107 or matching placebo&#xD;
      for 14 days. Each treatment period will be separated by a washout period of 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will complete clinical, cognitive and pharmacodynamic assessments during each&#xD;
      treatment period. PK blood samples will be collected prior to, during and after study&#xD;
      medication administration.&#xD;

    <description>Measures changes in visual and motor coordination and vigilance. In this task, a small circle (target) continuously moves across the screen in a semi-randomized fashion, so as to minimize the subject's ability to predict the trajectory of the target. The subject is instructed to use his/her finger on the touch screen to move a small dot so that it is consistently within the center of the moving target on the screen. During the test, the speed of the circle is adjusted in response to the subject's ability to keep the dot in the circle, ensuring that the test is adapted to the individual subject.</description>
