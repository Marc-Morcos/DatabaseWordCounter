  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of the rapid aging of the global population, dementia has become a serious problem,&#xD;
      and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. AD is pathologically&#xD;
      characterized by substantial neuronal loss and chronic inflammation that is associated with&#xD;
      cerebrovascular and parenchymal accumulation of proteinaceous deposits enriched in&#xD;
      amyloid-beta (Aβ). More recent evidence shows it is due to an increased blood-to-brain&#xD;
      delivery of circulating Aβ, and significant peripheral Aβ metabolism occurs in association&#xD;
      with post-prandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the prodromal stage of AD, patients usually suffer mild cognition impairment (MCI). The&#xD;
      annual conversion rate of MCI to AD is around 10%, and within 3 years, around 30%-50% of&#xD;
      these develop dementia. Brain atrophy is an irreversible brain disease that causes problems&#xD;
      with cognitive and memory functions in many diseases, such as MCI and AD, etc. In order to&#xD;
      allow preventive intervention for AD, MCI must be diagnosed as early as possible, using&#xD;
      biomarker assays or simple imaging modality. From 2009-2013, the investigators have&#xD;
      registered 4,492 patients with atherosclerotic vascular diseases (AVD). In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators have also registered 8,209 cases with no evidence of AVD, but with at least 1&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factor. In this 5-year project, 300 male or female patients with stable&#xD;
      symptomatic AVD over 20 years of age, and the other 600 patients with no evidence of AVD but&#xD;
      with at least 1 CV risk factor, will be enrolled from our previous registry program. The&#xD;
      baseline and yearly follow-up study will include clinical examination, neurocognitive&#xD;
      function evaluation, and laboratory tests (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, TG, hs-CRP, and Aβ-40, Aβ-42,&#xD;
      tau protein, and other biological signatures: adiponectin, MMP-3, MMP-9, IL-6, Fibrinogen,&#xD;
      Lp-PLA2, 8-Isoprostane, hFABP, sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, CA-125, MCP-1, TNF-α, cTnI, NT-proBNP, CNP,&#xD;
      NGAL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this 5-year project are (1) to clarify the association of triglyceride-rich&#xD;
      lipoprotein and the development of dementia; (2) to validate the diagnostic power and&#xD;
      prognostic implication of ultra-low-concentration biomarkers (Aβ-40, Aβ-42 and tau) for&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;

      Because of the rapid aging of the global population, dementia has become a serious problem,&#xD;
      and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Population studies have&#xD;
      shown that dietary fats influence risk and progression of age-related diseases including AD,&#xD;
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Consumption of saturated fat, trans-fatty acids and&#xD;
      cholesterol are positively associated with increased risk. These findings support the&#xD;
      hypothesis that dietary saturated-fats (SFA) and cholesterol, or dietary induced dyslipidemia&#xD;
      are causally associated with AD risk. AD is pathologically characterized by substantial&#xD;
      neuronal loss and chronic inflammation that is associated with cerebrovascular and&#xD;
      parenchymal accumulation of proteinaceous deposits enriched in amyloid-beta (Aβ). More recent&#xD;
      evidence shows it is due to an increased blood-to-brain delivery of circulating Aβ, and&#xD;
      significant peripheral Aβ metabolism occurs in association with post-prandial&#xD;
      triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.&#xD;
