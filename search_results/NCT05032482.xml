  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, controlled, randomized clinical trial (RCT) to establish the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of a non-invasive neuromodulation device for treating symptoms associated with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 45 participants will first enter the double-blinded, controlled, randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial (RCT) and will self-administer treatments twice daily in the home setting over a period&#xD;
      of 24 weeks. Then participants who completed the RCT portion of the study will enter the Open&#xD;
      Label Extension (OLE) where all participants will self-administer twice-daily treatments&#xD;
      using a treatment mode that previously was shown to be associated with improved cognition in&#xD;
      another neurodegenerative disorder. The OLE treatment period will last 24 weeks.&#xD;
