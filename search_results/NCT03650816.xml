  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, remains largely&#xD;
      undefined and the early diagnostic and effective treatments are still not available. In&#xD;
      addition to the neuropathological hallmarks, cerebrovascular dysfunction has been identified&#xD;
      as an important component of AD. Using the experimental models, we showed that&#xD;
      cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), the ability of cerebral vessels to dilate or constrict in&#xD;
      response to stimuli, is impaired very early in AD. We designed this trial to compare CVR to&#xD;
      carbon dioxide (CVR CO2) in AD patients and in persons with subjective cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (SCI), the cognitively healthy individuals which began to worry about worsening their memory,&#xD;
      and to correlate CVR CO2 with AD markers in cerebrospinal fluid and the blood markers of&#xD;
      endothelial function. We hypothesize that CVR represents a potential diagnostic/prognostic&#xD;
      marker and an attractive target for the development of new therapeutics in AD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine, whether the measurement of CVR CO2 makes&#xD;
      it possible to differentiate AD patients from control SCI subjects (subjects with a memory&#xD;
      complaint but without cognitive impairment as assessed with neuropsychological tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also pursue the following secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish correlations between cognitive level and CVR CO2 in the 2 groups: SCI and AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate a correlation between CVR CO2 and AD markers in cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the correlation between cognitive function (Z score of neuropsychological tests)&#xD;
           and CVR CO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Look for a correlation between CVR CO2 and plasma levels of markers of endothelial&#xD;
           function: endothelin-1 (ET-1), big-ET-1, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) as well as&#xD;
           plasma renin activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll a total of 24 male and/or female patients (&gt; 18 years) with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      AD (group AD) and 24 male and/or female SCI subjects (&gt; 18 years) which came to our hospital&#xD;
      for consultation about poor memory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be informed on the study protocol during his / her regular follow-up visit&#xD;
      at Broca hospital's day clinic. Informed consent/assent will be obtained from each subject or&#xD;
      his/her representative prior to conducting any study related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study participant will make a total of two visits. The first (baseline) visit will be&#xD;
      made to the Geriatric Department of the Broca hospital. At baseline visit, a complete medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, neurological examination, as well as the MRI and lumbar&#xD;
      puncture data, if available, will be collected. A blood sample of 10 ml will be drawn in&#xD;
      addition to the blood sample taken as part of patient usual care. A medical appointment will&#xD;
      be made at the Clinical Physiology Department of the Lariboisière Hospital for CVR CO2&#xD;
      measurement (visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second and the final visit will take place approximately one month after the baseline&#xD;
      visit. The CVR CO2 will be assessed using Doppler ultrasonography, as a change in blood flow&#xD;
      in the internal and common carotid arteries during the 10th minute of inhalation of a gas&#xD;
      mixture containing 5% CO2, 16% O2 and 79% N2, compared to the baseline blood flow value&#xD;
      measured after 10 minutes rest in lying position. Ten minutes after the end of the inhalation&#xD;
      of the hypercapnic mixture, patients will receive a sublingual administration of a&#xD;
      nitroglycerin spray (NTG 300 μg, Procter and Gamble Pharmaceuticals) and the carotid blood&#xD;
      flow will be recorded between the 3rd and the 5th minute after NTG administration. In this&#xD;
      way, the maximal blood flow obtained after endothelial-independent vasodilatation will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in carotid blood flow (before and during hypercapnia) will be compared by a&#xD;
      covariance analysis (variables known to interfere with CVR will be included as covariates).&#xD;
      The analyses will be conducted considering the CVR CO2 variable in absolute values and&#xD;
      relative values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multiple regression model will be used to test the hypothesis of a relationship between CVR&#xD;
      CO2 and cognitive level (Z score of neuropsychological tests), CVR CO2 and AD markers in&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid, and CVR CO2 and the plasma concentration of ET-1, bigET-1, ADMA and&#xD;
      plasma renin activity in the two groups: SCI and AD. Variables known to be cognitively&#xD;
      related and known to be CVR related will be included in the model. The slopes of the&#xD;
      regressions between CVR CO2 and the different parameters of interest will be compared between&#xD;
      the two groups. Models taking into account each biomarker of interest separately and then a&#xD;
      global model will be constructed.&#xD;
