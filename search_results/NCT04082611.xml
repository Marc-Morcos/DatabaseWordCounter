  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PREVENTION Trial is a 12-month, two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) in adults 50-80&#xD;
      years old experiencing cognitive decline. Our study clinicians will refer patients for&#xD;
      enrollment based on three categories: 1) a diagnosis of mild AD according to criteria&#xD;
      established by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke&#xD;
      (AD and Related Disorders Association [NINCDS-ADRDA]), 2) those with mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment will be diagnosed according to the Petersen method, and 3) subjective memory&#xD;
      impairment as assessed by neuropsychological assessments and self-report. Enrollment will&#xD;
      require evidence of AD pathophysiological processes (as defined by a positive amyloid&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a coached, data-driven, multi-modal&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention to treat cognitive decline. Subjects will be randomized into one of&#xD;
      two groups: Group 1 (Active Control) or Group 2 (Intervention). Group 1 (Data-driven clinical&#xD;
      recommendations (CR)) will serve as the active control group and will receive data-driven&#xD;
      clinical recommendations by a study physician based on study assessments and clinical lab&#xD;
      values. Group 2 (Data-driven multi-modal intervention with coaching (MMIC)) will receive the&#xD;
      same clinical recommendations and also an intensive multi-modal intervention with health&#xD;
      coaching, support and resources to carry out these recommendations. This includes health&#xD;
      coaching sessions (with an RDN), dietary counseling sessions (with an RDN), and group&#xD;
      cognitive and physical exercise classes (CogFit) with a certified personal trainer and a&#xD;
      computer-based neurocognitive program at home. Both groups will be measured for treatment&#xD;
      related changes in cognitive and functional abilities, quality of life, biological, and&#xD;
      biochemical measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to analyze longitudinal multi-omic data, including metabolomics,&#xD;
      proteomics, genetics, microbiome, behavior and cognition into personalized, dense, dynamic&#xD;
      data (i.e. PD3) from individuals with cognitive decline and underlying Alzheimer's&#xD;
      neuropathology. The goal analysis is to identify models of causation that can further advance&#xD;
      knowledge and research in neurodegenerative disorders and healthy living.&#xD;

      Subject identification and recruitment - All participants will be recruited from the Pacific&#xD;
      Brain Health Center in Santa Monica, which is a high-volume memory-care and dementia&#xD;
      outpatient clinic within a large physician medical group affiliated with Providence Saint&#xD;
      John's Health Center. 60 participants will be randomized into the RCT, with 30 in each&#xD;
      treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for Obtaining Informed Consent - All participants will receive the Experimental&#xD;
      Research Subject's Bill of Rights prior to signing the informed consent form (ICF),&#xD;
      authorization of use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI), and authorization&#xD;
      of medical record release for the subject's treating physician, will be obtained from each&#xD;
      participants prior to enrolling in the study. A copy of all signed ICF's will be given to the&#xD;
      participants, and the investigator will retain the original.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Functional Assessment Staging Test (FAST) will be done before participants are consented to&#xD;
      determine whether they or a legally appointed representative (LAR) can consent to participate&#xD;
      in the study. In this study, participants with FAST stages 2-4 will be recruited (see&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considerations for consenting: FAST Stages 2-3 Participants - FAST stages 2-3 participants&#xD;
      are usually capable of making medical and legal decisions, and will be consented directly,&#xD;
      unless there is a caregiver, legally appointed representative, or other reason to think that&#xD;
      an informed consent cannot be given by the participants without approval by a reliable&#xD;
      informant acting on their behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considerations for consenting: FAST Stage 4 (mild dementia) Participants - FAST stage 4&#xD;
      participants will be consented by having them give oral or written assent, indicating their&#xD;
      preference with regard to study participation. In addition, the caregiver or legally&#xD;
      appointed representative of a demented participants will be consented to assure full&#xD;
      understanding of study procedures and willingness on behalf of the participants to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consenting approach for patients with cognitive impairment has been evaluated by the&#xD;
      Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins, and found to adequately&#xD;
      ensure informed consent. They concluded that ADRD participants should not be excluded from&#xD;
      study participation if they cannot directly consent themselves, so long as their caregivers&#xD;
      can consent, and the participants can assent, either verbally or in writing, their preference&#xD;
      to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The caregiver or legally appointed representative will be required to accompany participants&#xD;
      to participate in the required procedures. A copy of the appropriate document (e.g., the&#xD;
      power of attorney for healthcare) will be obtained and filed with the original ICF.&#xD;

    <measure>NIH ToolBox Cognition Function Battery - Cognitive Function Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To test the hypothesis that high contact coaching is better than no coaching for people in the early stages and at risk for cognitive decline. We plan to test that after one year of coached data-driven personalized interventions, participants in the coaching (CDDCR) (Group 2) will have less cognitive decline than the non-coaching (DDCR) arm (Group 1) as measured by the NIH ToolBox Cognition Function Battery (NIHTB-CB).&#xD;
The Cognitive Function Composite Score will be our primary outcome measure for cognitive function. The NIHTB-CB contains seven computer-based instruments assessing five cognitive sub-domains: Language, Executive Function, Episodic Memory, Processing Speed, and Working Memory. The Composite Score is calculated using all seven subsets of the NIHTB-CB. Participants will be assessed at baseline and one year.</description>
