  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study will be to test whether Kundalini yoga (KY) and Kirtan Kriya&#xD;
      (KK) yogic meditation is superior to Memory Enhancement Training (MET) for improving&#xD;
      cognitive functioning, health (including cardiovascular factors), and mood in women with high&#xD;
      AD risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall, the investigators anticipate recruiting 100 women (50 or older) with MCI and high&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease risk. Subjects will either receive: (1) MET class for 60 minutes per&#xD;
      week; or (2) Kundalini yoga and &quot;Kirtan Kriya&quot; meditation class for 60 minutes per week.&#xD;
      Assessments will be completed immediately after the interventions at 6 and 12 weeks and&#xD;
      follow-up visits at week 24 and 48 to monitor the overall benefit of the intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) total recall score</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal memory was measured with the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) total recall scores. The HVLT form contains 12 nouns, four words each from one of three semantic categories (e.g., precious gems, articles of clothing, vegetables, etc.), to be learned over the course of three learning trials. When scoring the HVLT, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score. Total scores range from 0-36 with higher scores indicating better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures included the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ), a self-assessment scale. The MFQ is a scale that assess subjective memory complaints. We will use the following MFQ subscales: General Frequency of Forgetting, Seriousness of Forgetting, and Retrospective Functions. Each item is scored from 1 to 7 with higher scores indicate higher level of perceived memory functioning. General frequency of forgetting (33 items) ranges from 7 to 231, Seriousness of Forgetting (18 items) ranges from 7-126 and Retrospective Functions (5 items) ranges from 7 to 35.</description>

    <measure>Change in Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Health-Related quality of life will be determined using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) which comprises 8 scales: physical functioning, role limitations - physical, role limitations - emotional, energy, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, and general health. Scales are scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating higher quality of life.</description>
