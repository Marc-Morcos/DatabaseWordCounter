  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether a set of algorithms analysing&#xD;
      acoustic and linguistic patterns of speech, can predict change in Preclinical Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Clinical Composite with semantic processing (PACC5) between baseline and +12 month follow up&#xD;
      across all four Arms, as measured by the coefficient of individual agreement (CIA) between&#xD;
      the change in PACC5 and the corresponding regression model, trained on baseline speech data&#xD;
      to predict it. Secondary objectives include (1) evaluating whether similar algorithms can&#xD;
      predict change in PACC5 between baseline and +12 month follow up in the cognitively normal&#xD;
      (CN) and MCI populations separately; (2) evaluating whether similar algorithms trained to&#xD;
      regress against PACC5 scores at baseline, still regress significantly against PACC5 scores at&#xD;
      +12 month follow-up, as measured by the coefficient of individual agreement (CIA) between the&#xD;
      PACC5 composite at +12 months and the regression model, trained on baseline speech data to&#xD;
      predict PACC5 scores at baseline; (3) evaluating whether similar algorithms can classify&#xD;
      converters vs non-converters in the cognitively normal Arms (Arm 3 + 4), and fast vs slow&#xD;
      decliners in the MCI Arms (Arm 1 + 2), as measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the&#xD;
      receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity and Cohen's kappa of the&#xD;
      corresponding binary classifiers. Secondary objectives include the objectives above, but&#xD;
      using time points of +24 months and +36 months; and finally to evaluate whether the model&#xD;
      performance for the objectives and outcomes above improved if the model has access to speech&#xD;
      data at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 month timepoints.&#xD;
