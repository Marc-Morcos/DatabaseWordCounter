    <textblock>
      In the next years a number of phase 2-3 trials which utilize experimental drugs possibly&#xD;
      disease modifying for Alzheimer Dementia will reach their conclusion. This dense clinical&#xD;
      trials activity has triggered a fundamental question both from Patients and Scientific&#xD;
      Communities and Health Authorities/Insurances: on which basis will the new drugs -if&#xD;
      effective-be distributed to patients or at-risk population? This question mainly deals with&#xD;
      the &quot;MCI prodromal to AD&quot;condition since the MCI population actually includes about 50% of&#xD;
      those who will progress to AD (the real &quot;prodromic to AD&quot; MCI form) while the remaining 50%&#xD;
      will never convert to AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The INTERCEPTOR project is focused on the prodromic AD condition (IWG2) or the MCI condition&#xD;
      (NIA-AA) which form the neuropsychological point of view and is characterized by means of:&#xD;
      cognitive questionnaires, screening test (MMSE), extended neuropsychological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an observational, longitudinal cohort one, in which the baseline clinical and&#xD;
      biomarkers characteristics of the enrolled MCI subjects at baseline will be compared for&#xD;
      those classified as &quot;AD converters&quot; after 3.0 years of follow-up with respect to those&#xD;
      &quot;non-converters&quot;. MCI subjects who will convert to other forms of dementia will be examined&#xD;
      separately. It will be considered the conversion to Alzheimer's disease within 3.0 years&#xD;
      after diagnosis of MCI, together with the assessment of those who remain in a stable&#xD;
      condition and those who have a reversion to normal cognitive profile. People with MCI who&#xD;
      convert to other forms of dementia will be considered separately. The biomarker or a set of&#xD;
      biomarkers that can predict the conversion to Alzheimer's disease with higher accuracy will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the next 8 years a number of phase 2-3 trials will end up which utilize experimental drugs&#xD;
      possibly disease modifying for Alzheimer Dementia. They target different disease stages:&#xD;
      mild-moderate AD, 'early' AD, MCI prodromic to AD (MCI + for biomarkers heralding progression&#xD;
      to AD), pre-symptomatic AD in pathogenetic gene mutation carriers of familiar AD forms. This&#xD;
      dense clinical trials activity has triggered a fundamental question both from Patients and&#xD;
      Scientific Communities and Health Authorities/Insurances: on which basis will the new drugs&#xD;
      -if effective-be distributed to patients or at-risk population? This question mainly deals&#xD;
      with the &quot;MCI prodromal to AD&quot;condition since the MCI population actually includes about 50%&#xD;
      of those who will progress to AD (the real &quot;prodromic to AD&quot; MCI form) while the remaining&#xD;
      50% will never convert to AD. Since the new drugs -if effective- will carry both elevated&#xD;
      unit costs and not marginal side-effects, they should be administered selectively to those&#xD;
      MCI with a severely high risk of conversion (i.e. 90% or more) and particularly to those with&#xD;
      a highrisk of rapid conversion (1-2 years from diagnosis of the MCI condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The INTERCEPTOR project is focused on the prodromic AD condition (IWG2) or the MCI condition&#xD;
      (NIA-AA) which form the neuropsychological point of view and is characterized by means of:&#xD;
      cognitive questionnaire, screening test (MMSE), extended neuropsychological evaluation (incl.&#xD;
      2 episodic memory tests, language test, visuo-spatial abilities evaluation, behavioural&#xD;
      scales, functional scales (Annex), full neurological examination. CDR must be 0.5. Atypical&#xD;
      types of clinical presentations must be particularly considered (i.e. non amnesic debut) for&#xD;
      a differential diagnosis where the role of biomarkers is pivotal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Italy, according to a recent study, an MCI prevalence of 5.9% has been evaluated in over&#xD;
      60 yrs population, with an increase of 4.5% between 60 &amp; 69 yrs, of 5.8% between 70 &amp; 79 yrs,&#xD;
      and up to 7.1% in the 80 - 89 yrs range. On this epidemiological basis about 735.000 MCI&#xD;
      cases are estimated for 2016in the resident Italian population. Multicentric non therapeutic&#xD;
      cohort study in subjects fulfilling the MCI &quot;core&quot; criteria as defined by the National&#xD;
      Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. The study design reflect a longitudinal cohort study in which the&#xD;
      baseline clinical and biomarkers characteristics of the enrolled MCI subjects at baseline&#xD;
      will be compared for those classified as &quot;AD converters&quot; after 3.0 years of follow-up with&#xD;
      respect to those &quot;non-converters&quot;. MCI subjects who will convert to other forms of dementia&#xD;
      will be examined separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the medications at baseline are allowed without modifications for the whole protocol&#xD;
      except for urgencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological follow-up tests will be carried out at 6 months intervals (total 7 from&#xD;
      T0= baseline to T6= 42 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 60 days from T0 biomarkers must be carried out/collected including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMSE &amp; DRF - FCSRT) DNA extraction and ApoE typing Lumbar Puncture for Beta/Tau metabolites&#xD;
      EEG for brain connectivity with graph theory MRI + hippocampal volumetry (18F)FDG-PET&#xD;
