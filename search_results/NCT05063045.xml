      The purpose of this study is to develop and examine the preliminary effects of a smart cloth&#xD;
      care system for facilitating family caregiving for persons with dementia in the home setting.&#xD;
      This will be a three-year study, with the first two years to explore the feasibility of such&#xD;
      a smart cloth care system and the third year to pilot test its effects. During the third&#xD;
      year, a quasi experimental design will be implemented and the outcomes of caregivers and&#xD;
      persons with dementia will be followed for 6 months.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to develop and examine the preliminary effects of a smart cloth&#xD;
      care system for facilitating family caregiving for persons with dementia in the home setting.&#xD;
      A smart-care model, using smart clothing with a remote monitoring system, was developed to&#xD;
      assist home-nursing care. Older persons with dementia are asked to wear a smart vest, which&#xD;
      contained a coin-size monitor in a hidden inner pocket. Sensors are installed in bedrooms and&#xD;
      living areas to receive signals from the smart clothing. Alarm at door, emergency button and&#xD;
      smoke detector are also installed. The signals and emergency information are transmitted to&#xD;
      the mobile phones of responsible home care nurses, who have downloaded an app to their&#xD;
      phones. After the home care nurse receive a sensor signal, she would then give feedback to&#xD;
      family caregivers about the care receiver, including emergency calls, frequent getting up at&#xD;
      night, staying in the bathroom for more than 30 minutes, inadequate or abnormal activity&#xD;
      level, not moving during the day for more than 2 hours, leaving the house alone, and a sensor&#xD;
      being disconnected from the system. Based on information and signals from smart-care sensors,&#xD;
      home care nurses will discuss caregiving activities and planning with family&#xD;
      caregivers.Participants were asked to wear smart clothing for at least 4 days/week for 6&#xD;
      months. A home care research nurse will visit the home setting to assess it for sensor&#xD;
      installation and suggest environmental modifications for potential hazards. A second visit&#xD;
      will be made by an engineer with the research nurse to install the sensors. The research&#xD;
      nurse visit the participants' homes once a week during the first month and once every month&#xD;
      from the second to third month after the sensor installation to conduct in-home interventions&#xD;
      and resolve problems using the smart-care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first two years, this smart cloth care system will be developed. During the third&#xD;
      year. The investigators plan to recruit at least 60 participants and randomize them into an&#xD;
      intervention group (N=30) that receives the smart cloth care model and a control group (N=30)&#xD;
      that receives usual care. Patient and caregiver outcomes will be followed every two months&#xD;
      for a period of 6 months after the smart cloth care system has been implemented. Finally&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat and hierarchical linear models will be used to analyze the results.&#xD;
