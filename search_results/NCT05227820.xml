      This study seeks to measure changes in cognition through verbal and visual test procedures&#xD;
      and changes in biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory and metabolic parameters&#xD;
      that can be measure in the central nervous system (CNS) with advanced neuroimaging techniques&#xD;
      in patients treated with NE3107 (17a-ethynyl-androst-5-3b,7b,17b-triol).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considering how many people are in a state of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and frank&#xD;
      dementia, there is a substantial cost to society in terms of financial burden and suffering.&#xD;
      Degenerative conditions that result in cognitive change in middle and late life are&#xD;
      frequently associated with abnormal deposits of protein material (e.g., amyloid, phospho-tau)&#xD;
      which interfere with neuronal function and viability. Inflammation and insulin resistance in&#xD;
      the CNS and abnormal protein deposition and resultant physiological impairment characterize&#xD;
      conditions of the Alzheimer's dementia (AD) type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroinflammation prompts AD progression, impaired cholesterol efflux and reduced insulin&#xD;
      signaling (insulin resistance). Insulin resistance has been considered a risk factor as well&#xD;
      as a feature of AD, and has also been associated with increased aß-42 secretion, neuritic&#xD;
      plaque burden, abnormal insulin receptor performance, decreased glucose metabolism, and&#xD;
      consequently decreased cognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No therapy exists that has been proven to halt or reverse the progressive deposition of&#xD;
      abnormal proteins or the attendant neurophysiological deterioration. Various investigational&#xD;
      therapies aim to target the pathophysiological processes of AD; from combating abnormal&#xD;
      protein deposition, to targeting sources of systemic and neuroinflammation, to providing&#xD;
      cholinergic, hormonal, and metabolic support. A promising area of research is the ongoing use&#xD;
      of insulin synthesizers as a therapeutic option for AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several Phase 3 studies have been initiated and/or completed with compounds such as&#xD;
      Semaglutide, a hormone that stimulates insulin signaling, Metformin, an insulin synthesizer,&#xD;
      and NE3107, an anti-inflammatory insulin-sensitizing agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to measure changes in cognition through verbal and visual test procedures&#xD;
      and changes in biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory and metabolic parameters&#xD;
      that can be measured in the CNS with advanced neuroimaging techniques in patients treated&#xD;
      with NE3107 (17a-ethynyl-androst-5-ene-3b,7b,17b-triol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Product&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug under investigation is NE3107 (17a-ethynyl-androst-5-ene-3b,7b,17b-triol). NE3107 is&#xD;
      formulated with common excipients used in oral medications in #2 hard gelatin capsules. The&#xD;
      capsules are designed for oral administration. NE3107 capsules are stable at room temperature&#xD;
      for at least 18 months. Stability of the capsules used in this study will be monitored by a&#xD;
      concurrent stability study conducted by the capsule manufacturer and the holder of the&#xD;
      primary IND, Biovie, Inc (Santa Monica, CA).&#xD;

    <description>Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS)&#xD;
The Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) is an interview-based tool administered by study officials to participants' caregivers used to obtain observations from a consistent source. The QDRS form consists of 10 categorical questions (5 cognitive, 5 functional), each with 5 detailed options depicting the level of impairment as either 0 (normal), 0.5 (mild/inconsistent impairment), 1 (mild/consistent impairment), 2 (moderate impairment), or 3 (severe impairment). Based on the conversion table outlined in Dr. James Galvin's research (2015), total QDRS scores were converted to Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale levels ranging from 0 (normal aging), 0.5 (mild cognitive impairment), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), and 3 (severe dementia).</description>

    <description>The MoCA evaluates frontal-executive functions (e.g., verbal abstraction and mental calculation), language (e.g., confrontation naming, phonemic fluency), orientation (e.g., person, place, date, day of the week, and time), visuospatial construction (e.g., simple figure copy), divided visual attention, and immediate and delayed memory of unstructured information. MoCA scores range from 0-30 possible points; 26 or greater is considered to reflect normal cognitive status.</description>

It is composed of 11 parts that measure word recall, object/figure naming, command following, constructional praxis, ideational praxis, orientation, word recognition, test direction recall, spoken language, comprehension, and word-finding difficulty. The ADAS-Cog is scored from 0-70 by measuring the errors made in each task, with a score of 70 representing the most severe impairment. A point reduction of 3.1 to 3.8 has been found to be the minimal clinically important difference (Schrag &amp; Schott, 2012). A change will be evaluated from baseline to completion.</description>

MMSE scores range from 0 - 30 possible points; 0-17: severe cognitive impairment, 18-23: mild cognitive impairment, 24-30: no cognitive impairment. A point decrease &gt;/= to 3 on the MMSE has been identified as the minimally clinically important difference (Andres, 2019). A change will be evaluated from baseline to completion.</description>
