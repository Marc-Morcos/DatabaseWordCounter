      In this clinical trial, five strains of probiotics (Bifidobacterium breve Bv-889, B. longum&#xD;
      subspecies infantis BLI-02, B. bifidum Bf-688, B. animalis subsp. lactis CP-9, Lactobacillus&#xD;
      plantarum PL-02) with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory functions will been applied to slow&#xD;
      down the development of the Alzheimer's disease through regulating the intestinal flora and&#xD;
      immune system of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease symptoms. The efficacy of&#xD;
      probiotic treatment against Alzheimer's disease will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that mainly results in dementia. According&#xD;
      to statistics, about 60-70% of dementia patients in Taiwan are Alzheimer's patients.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no effective medical treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Several drugs&#xD;
      and psychotherapy have been developed to attenuate the symptoms of the disease. The initial&#xD;
      symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are memory loss of recent events (short-term memory&#xD;
      impairment) and the disease can eventually deprive the patient's self-awareness in the late&#xD;
      phase. The main factor leading to Alzheimer's disease is rapid apoptosis of neuronal cells in&#xD;
      the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neuronal apoptosis is mainly due to abnormal chronic inflammatory reactions and oxidative&#xD;
      stress. The gut microbiota-brain axis (GMBA) reflects the two-way communication between the&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal tract. It has been reported that GMBA&#xD;
      dysregulation is closely related to neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elmira Akbari et al showed that patients with Alzheimer's disease supplemented with both&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus for 12 weeks expressed significantly higher Mini-Mental&#xD;
      State Examination (MMSE) scores than placebo group. Remarkably, biochemical indicators in the&#xD;
      patient's serum, such as C-reactive protein and triglyceride were also improved&#xD;
      significantly. However, the clinical study of Elmira Akbari did not further explore the role&#xD;
      of Bifidobacterium in controlling Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial, patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups: low dose probiotics&#xD;
      and normal dose probiotics. All patients will be supplemented with the probiotics for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Their (1) cognitive function, (2) cognitive behavioral ability, (3) sleep status (4)&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow (5) blood immune variation spectrum and blood biochemical indicators and&#xD;
      (6) variation of fecal flora will be analyze. The therapeutic efficiency of the probiotics&#xD;
      will be further evaluated by comparing the changes in data before and after probiotic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
