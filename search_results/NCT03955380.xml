    <textblock>
      This is a single-center multiple-ascending-dose clinical trial assessing the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of oral dosing of Contraloid acetate in healthy volunteers. The study drug&#xD;
      Contraloid (alias RD2, alias PRI-002) is an orally available all-D-peptide, which was&#xD;
      developed to directly destroy toxic and replicating A-beta oligomer prions, by disassembling&#xD;
      them into A-beta monomers. The study drug is specifically designed for the curative or at&#xD;
      least disease-modifying treatment of cognition, memory and behavior deficits in Alzheimer´s&#xD;
      disease patients. The study drug is BBB penetrable [1] and has demonstrated target engagement&#xD;
      in vitro and in vivo [2, 3]. Treatments in three different transgenic mouse models in three&#xD;
      different laboratories yielded improved cognition and deceleration of neurodegeneration, even&#xD;
      under truly non-preventive treatment conditions and even when applied orally [2-5]. The&#xD;
      hereby obtained PRI-002 plasma levels have also been achieved in humans after single oral&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;

      The investigation on the compound Contraloid acetate in a multiple-ascending-dose phase I&#xD;
      study has been performed in 24 healthy male participants, randomly assigned to the treatment.&#xD;
      Main focus was on the evaluation of the outcome of the safety and tolerability; secondarily&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the compound were assessed. Two different ascending&#xD;
      doses (160 and 320 mg Contraloid) administered orally (for 14 days in the first cohort and&#xD;
      for 28 days in the second cohort) as a single daily dose, were tested in two cohorts on&#xD;
      respectively eight participants per cohort, additionally four participants of each cohort&#xD;
      received placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to maintain the highest level of security for the participants of this study a&#xD;
      staggered design was used. First, only four sentinels of each cohort were administered with&#xD;
      the study drug or placebo (ratio 2:2). Only after assessing all available data by the data&#xD;
      safety and monitoring board (DSMB), the rest of the cohort (6 study drug: 2 placebo) were&#xD;
      allowed to be treated. This took place on two consecutive days, administering the study drug&#xD;
      to four participants per each starting day. After DSMB permission the next dose level was&#xD;
      started with the same scheme of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening period the informed consent was obtained and the evaluation of the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, collection of demographic data and previous medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination and health assessment, 12-lead ECG were performed. Additionally&#xD;
      vital signs, haemogram, coagulation, biochemistry and urine analysis determination, as well&#xD;
      as serology and testing of drug abuse were carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first study day the participants received in fasting conditions the study drug after&#xD;
      re-evaluation the inclusion/exclusion criteria. For monitoring the laboratory parameters and&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of Contraloid blood draws were performed in a predetermined frequency.&#xD;
      Physical conditions, vital signs, ECG, concomitant medication, adverse events were monitored&#xD;
      closely. Sentinels stayed in the Phase-I Unit for 7 days, and the remaining participants of&#xD;
      the cohort for 24 hours. The participants returned daily for administration. On Day 14/28&#xD;
      (cohort 1/cohort 2) the participants were admitted to the phase 1 unit for another 24 h for&#xD;
      PK-sampling. A follow-up was performed on Days 16/30, 17/31 and the End of Study Visit on Day&#xD;
      21/35. The study was double-blinded and conducted under the EU regulations and Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice (GCP) and national Austrian law. Monitoring and PV was performed by the CRO&#xD;
      NeuroScios, DM by Fundacion Teofilo Hernando, Spain, Bioanalytics by Nuvisan, Germany.It is a&#xD;
      Part the Cloud Translational Research Funding award from the Alzheimer´s Association.&#xD;
