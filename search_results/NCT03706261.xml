  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study employs tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a well-characterized&#xD;
      multi-racial/ethnic cohort to examine the extent to which tau pathology is associated with&#xD;
      cognition, differences in tau pathology across racial/ethnic groups, and the relationship&#xD;
      between MRI markers of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease and tau pathology. The study also&#xD;
      investigates amyloid-dependent tau spreading.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau protein is observed in several neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal&#xD;
      degeneration, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Tau is&#xD;
      a microtubular protein and its native function is to provide structural support to neurons.&#xD;
      Paired helical filaments composed of dysfunctional tau protein are found in several&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases. In AD, the clinical progression of dementia has been shown to&#xD;
      correlate with the amount and topographical spread of tau throughout the brain. Therefore,&#xD;
      detecting and quantifying tau aggregate load in brain would have diagnostic and prognostic&#xD;
      potential in clinical management of several neurological diseases. As disease modifying drugs&#xD;
      that target tau are being developed, there is a critical need for a reliable method of&#xD;
      detecting tau aggregates to confirm pathology in patients entering clinical trials.&#xD;
