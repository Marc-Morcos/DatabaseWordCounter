  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a disorder of uncertain cause and pathogenesis that primarily&#xD;
      affects older adults. It accounts for more than 50 percent of cases of dementia in the&#xD;
      elderly and is a leading source of morbidity and mortality in the aging population. The most&#xD;
      essential and often earliest symptom is selective memory impairment. While treatments can&#xD;
      improve some symptoms, there is no cure or disease-modifying therapy, and the disease&#xD;
      inevitably progresses in all patients. The mainstay of management is still symptomatic&#xD;
      treatment of behavioral disturbances, environmental manipulations to prevent behavioural&#xD;
      disturbances, and counseling with respect to safety issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to determine whether low doses of ionizing radiation (LDIR) from&#xD;
      repeat CT scanning improves function, cognition and/or behavior in severe AD. This is based&#xD;
      upon the treatments given in 2015 to a patient in hospice in the USA with advanced AD. On&#xD;
      July 23, she received two CT scans of her brain. Two weeks later she received a third CT&#xD;
      scan, and two weeks after this, a fourth CT scan. She partially improved and was discharged&#xD;
      to an Alzheimer care home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of the mechanism whereby CT scanning might lead to improvement, reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species (ROS) are produced abundantly and constantly by aerobic metabolism in all organisms,&#xD;
      damaging biomolecules including those in the brain. AD is postulated to be caused by the&#xD;
      accumulation of oxidative stress damage in the brain that was not prevented, repaired or&#xD;
      removed by the patient's own biological protective mechanisms. These systems, characterized&#xD;
      genetically, operate against all toxins regardless of whether they are produced endogenously&#xD;
      or by external physical, chemical or biological agents. As people age, their protection&#xD;
      systems become progressively weaker. LDIR is postulated to stimulate adaptive protection&#xD;
      systems. This may produce beneficial effects including improvement in AD symptoms. With about&#xD;
      three-quarters of human tissue being water, most of the initial radiation-induced damage is&#xD;
      radiolysis of water, producing ROS and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). LDIR leads to mild oxidative&#xD;
      stress and strong signaling, which up-regulates protection.The degree of stimulation likely&#xD;
      depends upon individual genetic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scans are approved for clinical diagnostic imaging. Approval will be requested from the&#xD;
      Research Ethics Board (REB) at Baycrest Health Sciences and from Health Canada to use CT&#xD;
      scanning for the experimental treatment of AD. If this pilot study is successful, i.e., if&#xD;
      improvement is observed in the participants, then a proposal will be prepared for more&#xD;
      comprehensive clinical studies of this novel treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Alzheimer Disease Functional Assessment and Change Scale (ADFACS)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>is a specific scale for the functional assessment of people with Alzheimer Disease. A number of specific descriptions of performance levels for each item is offered, and the caregiver is asked to identify the one that most accurately describes the patient's performance . The scale consists of 16 items for the assessment of ADL, i.e. 6 items for BADL, 10 for IADL. items are scored from 0 to 4: 0 = no impairment, 1 = mild impairment, 2 = moderate impairment, 3 = severe impairment and 4 = nonassessable, with a range from 0 to 30. BADL items are scored from 0 to 5: 0 = no impairment, 1 = mild impairment, 2 = moderate impairment, 3 = severe impairment, 4 = very severe impairment and 5 = nonassessable, with a range from 0 to 24. In each part, the 'nonassessable' answer is substituted by an estimation from the average of the responded items. The total score (IADL + BADL) ranges from 0 to 54 (from best to worst).</description>

    <description>Participants will receive the first LDIR treatment in one session on the same day, i.e., two CT scans of the brain that delivers a total X-ray dose (CTDIvol)10 of about 80 mGy. Participants will then be transported back to Baycrest Health Sciences. Participants will receive another LDIR treatment, i.e. a single CT scan of the brain (40 mGy), 2 weeks after the first session. They will receive a third LDIR treatment, i.e., a single CT scan of the brain (40 mGy), 2 weeks after the second session. Date, time and X-ray dose will be recorded for each participant and sent to their family physician for entry into in their health record.</description>
