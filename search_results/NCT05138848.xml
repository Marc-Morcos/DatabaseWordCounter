  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease affects approximately 5.6 million adults over age 65,&#xD;
      with costs expected to rise from $307 billion to $1.5 trillion over the next 30 years.&#xD;
      Behavioral interventions have shown promise for mitigating neurodegeneration and cognitive&#xD;
      impairments. Sleep is a modifiable health behavior that is critical for cognition and&#xD;
      deteriorates with advancing age and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, it is a priority to examine&#xD;
      whether improving sleep modifies Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and cognitive function.&#xD;
      Extant research suggests that deeper, more consolidated sleep is positively associated with&#xD;
      memory and executive functions and networks that underlie these processes. Preliminary&#xD;
      studies confirm that time-in-bed restriction interventions increase sleep efficiency and&#xD;
      non-rapid eye movement slow-wave activity (SWA) and suggest that increases in SWA are&#xD;
      associated with improved cognitive function. SWA reflects synaptic downscaling predominantly&#xD;
      among prefrontal connections. Downscaling of prefrontal connections with the hippocampus&#xD;
      during sleep may help to preserve the long-range connections that support memory and&#xD;
      cognitive function. In pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease, hyperactivation of the hippocampus&#xD;
      is thought to be excitotoxic and is shown to leave neurons vulnerable to further amyloid&#xD;
      deposition. Synaptic downscaling through SWA may mitigate the progression of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease through these pathways. The proposed study will behaviorally increase sleep depth&#xD;
      (SWA) through four weeks of time-in-bed restriction in older adults characterized on amyloid&#xD;
      deposition and multiple factors associated with Alzheimer's disease risk. This study will&#xD;
      examine whether behaviorally enhanced SWA reduces hippocampal hyperactivation, leading to&#xD;
      improved task-related prefrontal-hippocampal connectivity, plasma amyloid levels, and&#xD;
      cognitive function. This research addresses whether a simple, feasible, and scalable&#xD;
      behavioral sleep intervention improves functional neuroimaging indices of excitotoxicity,&#xD;
      Alzheimer's pathophysiology, and cognitive performance.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 65-85.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Self-report mean sleep efficiency (the time in bed spent asleep within the time of&#xD;
             lights out to final awakening) &lt; 90% based on diary and actigraphy estimates and wake&#xD;
             time after sleep onset &gt; 20 minutes based on diary and actigraphy estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Self-reported normal or corrected-to-normal visual and auditory acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Shift work involving night shift or regular work within the hours of 12am and 6am.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of a chronic condition that significantly affects sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severe psychiatric condition including major depressive disorder, panic disorder,&#xD;
             substance use disorders, and alcohol abuse/dependence within the past 6 months, or a&#xD;
             lifetime history of a psychotic disorder or bipolar I disorder, based on initial&#xD;
             online/phone self-report diagnoses, and subsequently based on the M.I.N.I&#xD;
             International Neuropsychiatric Interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current use of medications affecting sleep such as antidepressants, antipsychotic&#xD;
             medications, anticonvulsants, and steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Current use of sedating drugs used at bedtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Consumption of &gt; 14 alcohol drinks per week or &gt; 6 drinks at a single sitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Consumption of &gt; 3 caffeine drinks per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior diagnosis of a Central nervous system (CNS) disease, such as multiple sclerosis,&#xD;
             stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, seizure disorder, delirium or&#xD;
             dementia, a loss of consciousness &gt; 24 hours, or traumatic brain injury as identified&#xD;
             by the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS). Participants who are&#xD;
             diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease based on neuropsychological testing will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Sleep efficiency &gt; 90% and wake time after sleep onset &lt; 20 minutes consistent with&#xD;
             the rationale of the inclusion criteria described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Apnea/hypopnea index greater than 15 as determined by one night of Apnea Link Plus&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Metal in the body. Rationale: Due to the nature of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&#xD;
             participants cannot have any metal implants in their bodies, cannot have worked in a&#xD;
             metal shop or been exposed to metal fragments during combat. Metal dental work (e.g.&#xD;
             fillings crowns) may be allowed if compatible with the fMRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Claustrophobia. Rationale: Could prevent the participant from completing the MRI&#xD;
             scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Severe obesity. BMI &gt; 40. Rationale: Could prevent the participant from completing the&#xD;
             MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Near-miss or prior automobile accident &quot;due to sleepiness&quot; within the past 12 months.&#xD;
             Rationale: reduces the risk of sleepiness-related accidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Employed as a commercial driver during the study (for example, bus drivers, train&#xD;
             engineers, airplane pilots). Rationale: reduces the risk of sleepiness-related&#xD;
             accidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. A score below 23 on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. Rationale: This&#xD;
             cut-off has been demonstrated to differentiate well between individuals with mild&#xD;
             cognitive impairment from individuals with dementia who would have decision making&#xD;
             impairments (Seo et al. 2011, Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics). This ensures&#xD;
             that decision making abilities are intact.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. An Epworth sleepiness score greater than 10. Rationale: ensures that sleepiness is not&#xD;
             excessive before starting the intervention that could further increase sleepiness.&#xD;
             (Mazzotti, Diego R., et al. &quot;Is the Epworth Sleepiness Scale sufficient to identify&#xD;
             the excessively sleepy subtype of OSA?.&quot; Chest 161.2 (2022): 557-561; Aurora, R.&#xD;
