  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia with Lewy body (DLB) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia in autopsy&#xD;
      series. However, DLB represents a small proportion of the clinical diagnoses in epidemiology&#xD;
      registries. Indeed Alzheimer disease (AD) and DLB are often concomitant, they share many&#xD;
      symptoms and only a small weight is given to non-motor symptoms in DLB diagnosis. DLB is at&#xD;
      the end of a pathological spectrum overlapping with AD, explaining the poor diagnostic value&#xD;
      of both diagnostic criteria. To date there is still a need for a tool able to discriminate&#xD;
      patients with pure DLB from those expressing common signs with both AD and DLB and those with&#xD;
      pure AD. The purpose of this study is to validate a semi quantitative scale designed to&#xD;
      reflect the Lewy Bodies burden in patients with mild to moderate cognitive decline. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that the score obtained may differentiate between AD, DLB and&#xD;
      patients fulfilling clinical criteria for both DLB an AD. This score could also be correlated&#xD;
      with dopaminergic depletion assessed with [18F]fluorodopa PET/computed tomography and/or with&#xD;
      potential biomarkers of ADD measured in cerebrospinal fluid. This clinical validation is a&#xD;
      preliminary work preceding further studies correlating the LeSCoD score with functional&#xD;
      imaging features, prognosis and therapeutic response. Thus, the expected outcomes involve an&#xD;
      improvement in demented patients' care, as well as a better patient selection for further&#xD;
      therapeutic studies&#xD;
