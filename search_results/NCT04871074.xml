  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to use [C-11]UCB-J to obtain spatial information on&#xD;
      neuronal synapse abundance and inform Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to collect longitudinal amyloid, tau, and Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A)&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) in participants in the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      Research Center (ADRC) and Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP) across the&#xD;
      clinical stages of AD, including cognitively unimpaired biomarker negative, unimpaired&#xD;
      biomarker positive, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia due to AD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Synaptic loss is a major feature of symptomatic AD. Conversely, abundance of synapses may&#xD;
      confer resilience to cognitive decline in the presence of AD pathology. The&#xD;
      pathology-defining features of AD are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and their&#xD;
      presence and distribution can be spatially estimated in-vivo with amyloid and tau PET.&#xD;
      Although these biomarkers can inform on the degree and location of pathology, they do not&#xD;
      provide an indicator of their effect on collocated or extended in-network neural damage&#xD;
      including synaptic density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SV2A is expressed ubiquitously in synapses and the capability of assessing SV2A in vivo may&#xD;
      provide a direct indicator of synaptic health. Such information would be of high importance&#xD;
      for staging the level of synaptic loss or conversely synaptic abundance in the AD continuum&#xD;
      and may potentially improve prognostic precision. The PET radioligand [C-11]UCB-J is a marker&#xD;
      of SV2A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this project is to use [C-11]UCB-J to obtain spatial information on&#xD;
      neuronal synapse abundance and inform upon disease progression. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      collect longitudinal amyloid, tau, and SV2A PET in participants in the Wisconsin ADRC and&#xD;
      WRAP across the clinical stages of AD, including cognitively unimpaired biomarker negative,&#xD;
      unimpaired biomarker positive, MCI, and dementia due to AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 1). Determine the extent to which [C-11]UCB-J provides unique information&#xD;
           from MRI regarding neurodegeneration. Approach: The investigators will recruit N=60&#xD;
           cognitively unimpaired participants, N=30 MCI participants, and N=30 participants with&#xD;
           AD dementia to undergo PET imaging with [C-11]UCB-J. MRI will include anatomic and&#xD;
           diffusion connectivity MRI. When available, ancillary cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
           indicators of neurodegeneration and synapse function will be examined for relationships&#xD;
           with UCB-J.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 2). Determine the rate of synapse loss as reflected by [C-11]UCB-J signal&#xD;
           across all participants. Rationale: Trajectories of synaptic loss are unknown in vivo.&#xD;
           Approach: The investigators will determine the longitudinal trajectories of regional&#xD;
           synapse loss that are observed over time among participants who undergo repeat&#xD;
           [C-11]UCB-J (separated by two years, same participants scanned for Aim 1). The&#xD;
           investigators will also examine trajectories by amyloid and tau load. Quantifying&#xD;
           longitudinal synaptic loss is expected to eventually facilitate the identification of&#xD;
           individuals who are progressing to dementia, as well as inform upon changes that are&#xD;
           normal for age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 3). Determine the extent to which [C-11]UCB-J associates with cognitive&#xD;
           decline. Rationale: The investigators expect that lower baseline SV2A density and&#xD;
           longitudinal decline in SV2A density in the medial temporal lobe will be associated with&#xD;
           faster progression of cognitive decline. The investigators will also test the extent to&#xD;
           which harboring multiple pathologies (↑amyloid, ↑tau, and ↓SV2A density) contributes to&#xD;
           cognitive decline. Approach: The investigators will examine core indices of cognitive&#xD;
           status and continuous measures of cognitive function from the source cohorts and utilize&#xD;
           mixed effects models to ascertain the effect of UCB-J amyloid and tau on cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 4). Determine factors which impact synapse loss. Rationale: Several risk&#xD;
           factors for cognitive decline and dementia have been identified including potentially&#xD;
           modifiable factors such as insulin resistance and vascular risk factors. Approach: The&#xD;
           investigators will determine cross-sectional and longitudinal trajectories of regional&#xD;
           synapse loss in relation to risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia. In order to&#xD;
           determine insulin resistance, the investigators will perform blood draw and assess&#xD;
           fasting glucose and insulin values to determine the Homeostatic Model Assessment of&#xD;
           Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). The impact of potentially modifiable risk factors on&#xD;
           synapse loss in vivo is currently unknown. This aim will address this gap in knowledge,&#xD;
           results which may translate to strategies for reducing dementia risk.&#xD;
