  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pre-pilot project seeks to adapt an evidence-based psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention-Pain Adaptation Therapy (PATH)-that employs emotion regulation, behavioral&#xD;
      activation, and problem-solving skills training, that will be augmented with a caregiver (CG)&#xD;
      education component, for use by CGs of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related&#xD;
      Dementias (ADRD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team will conduct an uncontrolled pre-pilot test of an adapted PATH-Care&#xD;
      intervention with family CGs of persons with ADRD (target N=15). Following the informed&#xD;
      consent process, screening, and enrollment, participants will complete a baseline assessment,&#xD;
      8 PATH-Care sessions with short feedback interviews, tablet-based exercises, and a&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective(s): To adapt the existing PATH intervention as a tool to mitigate negative&#xD;
      emotions and stress experienced by informal CGs of individuals with ADRD, by employing an&#xD;
      evidence-based user-center design protocol and obtaining additional suggestions for program&#xD;
      refinement through an uncontrolled usability study.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Affect as Measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline; at week 10 (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The 20-item self-report Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS-GEN) asks participants to describe to what extent they feel different feelings and emotions on average. Respondents answer on a five-point scale: 1=Very slightly or not at all, 2=A little, 3=Moderately, 4=Quite a bit, 5=Extremely. There are different subscales within this measure with 10 questions measuring positive affect, and 10 measuring negative affect. These have scores ranging from 10-50 with a higher score indicating higher positive affect, and a lower score indicating lower negative affect respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depression as measured by Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline; at week 10 (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The 9-item self-report Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale asks participants about items like sadness, inner tension, sleep, and concentration. Respondents answer on a 7-point scale loosely by: 0=Normal, 2=Slight reduction, 4=Moderate reduction, and 6=Completely unable. These responses are personalized to the question a little more specifically. Scores range from 0-54 with a higher score indicating higher depression.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in caregiver burden as measured by Zarit Burden Interveiw (ZBI-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline; at week 10 (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The 12-item self-report Zarit Burden Interview Scale asks participants &quot;do you feel...?&quot; with responses about caregiver burden like anger, stress, and social life. Respondents answer on a 5-point scale: 0= Never, 1=Rarely, 2=Sometimes, 3=Quite Frequently, 4=Nearly Always. Scores range from 0-48 with a higher score indicating higher burden.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in efficacy and preparedness as measured by the Preparedness Caregiving Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline; at week 10 (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This 8-item likert questions with 1 open-ended question measures efficacy and preparedness for caregiving. Respondents answer the likert questions on a 5-point scale: 0=not at all prepared, 1=not too well prepared, 2=somewhat well prepared, 3=pretty well prepared, and 4=very well prepared. The mean score is calculated with these 8 questions and a higher score indicates higher preparedness. The open-ended question asks, &quot;Is there anything specific you would like to be better prepared for?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in emotion regulatory ability as measured by the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline; at week 10 (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item self-report Emotion Regulation Questionnaire measures cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression measured separately. Respondents answer on a seven-point scale: 1=strongly disagree, 4=neutral, and 7=strongly agree. The six cognitive reappraisal questions are calculated with a mean score and a higher score indicated higher cognitive reappraisal. The four expressive suppression questions are calculated with a mean score and a higher score indicates higher expressive suppression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in positive aspects of caregiving as measured by the Positive Aspects of Caregiving scale (PAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline; at week 10 (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The 9-item self-report scale measures positive aspects of caregiving. Respondents answer on a 5-point scale: 1=disagree a lot, 2=disagree a little, 3=neither agree or disagree, 4=agree a little, and 5=agree a lot. The questions are summed with a range of 9-45 with a higher score indicating more positive caregiving experiences.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility, Acceptability, and Usability of PATH-Care intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 10 (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility, acceptability, and usability will be measured by 6 open-ended questions during the post-intervention assessment. Questions include &quot;What were your overall impressions of the therapy?,&quot; &quot;What would you change about the therapy?,&quot; and &quot;Would you recommend this treatment to people who are caregivers like yourself?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction as measured by Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 10 (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This 3-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire measures the self-reported satisfaction of the intervention. Respondents report levels of satisfaction on a 4-point scale with 4 having &quot;almost all of my needs have been met&quot; &quot;very satisfied&quot; and &quot;yes, definitely&quot; and 1 having &quot;none of my needs have been met&quot;, &quot;quite dissatisfied&quot;, and &quot;no, definitely not&quot;. Scores range from 3-12 with a higher score indicating higher satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usable intervention as measured by the System Usability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 10 (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This 10-item adapted measure of the System Usability Scale will measure usability of the intervention. Respondents rank each question from 1 to 5 based on how much they agree with the statement with 5 being &quot;strongly agree&quot; and 1 being &quot;strongly disagree&quot;. Scores are converted to a 100-point scale with a higher score indicating higher usability.</description>
