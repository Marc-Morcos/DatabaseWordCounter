      This is a single-arm, longitudinal, observational study on the use of wearable sensors and&#xD;
      digital health technology to measure fall frequency and motor, speech, and cognitive function&#xD;
      in patients with PSP over the course of approximately one year. Participants will perform&#xD;
      supervised remote assessments monthly and in-person assessments approximately every 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of using wearable sensors&#xD;
      and digital health technology to remotely monitor patients with possible or probable PSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to measure PSP progression using sensor-derived motor and&#xD;
      tablet-derived speech and cognitive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, 40-50 individuals with possible or probable PSP will be enrolled at 4-5 sites in&#xD;
      the U.S. and followed for one year. During the monitoring period (1 year), a wearable pendant&#xD;
      sensor (PAMSys, BioSensics) will be used to monitor falls and physical activity (step counts)&#xD;
      of all participants during activities of daily living (ADL). On a monthly basis, participants&#xD;
      will have televideo conferences with the sites to perform supervised gait and balance tasks&#xD;
      while wearing 3 LEGSys (BioSensics) sensors. Using a study-supplied tablet, participants will&#xD;
      also perform cognitive tests including fluency, color trails and go-no-go tapping tests.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo more extensive testing every 3 months including the PSPRS, MoCA,&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires and functional rating scales which will be performed remotely&#xD;
      (virtually). Approximately 6 months participants will undergo an in-person PSPRS (to coincide&#xD;
      with their clinic appointments).&#xD;
