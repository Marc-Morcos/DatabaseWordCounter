  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain oscillations are ubiquitous in the human brain and have been implicated in cognitive&#xD;
      and behavioral states defined in precisely tuned neural networks. In neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disorders, neurodegeneration is accompanied by changes in oscillatory activity leading to the&#xD;
      emerging concept of neurological and psychiatric disorders as &quot;oscillopathies&quot;. Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, which accounts for the vast majority of age-related dementias, is characterised by a&#xD;
      prominent disruption of oscillations in the gamma frequency band. The restoration of gamma&#xD;
      oscillations by neural entrainment in animal models of Alzheimer's disease have shown a&#xD;
      remarkable decrease in the pathological burden of amyloid and tau via increased microglial&#xD;
      activity, resulting in a significant increase of cognitive performances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial alternating current brain stimulation (tACS), is a neurophysiological method of&#xD;
      non-invasive modulation of the excitability of the central nervous system that is having an&#xD;
      increasingly numerous spectrum of potential therapeutic applications. Recent studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in modulating the natural frequencies of&#xD;
      cerebral oscillation, underlying multiple cognitive processes such as verbal memory,&#xD;
      perception and working memory. On the basis of these premises, the treatment with gamma tACS&#xD;
      is proposed in patients affected by Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over study, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the modulators of response on cognitive measure to a single stimulation with gamma&#xD;
      tACS on the posterior parietal cortex in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment due to&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

      Subjects will be randomized in two groups, one receiving a single treatment with gamma tACS&#xD;
      (40 Hz) first and the other receiving sham stimulation. After one week the treatments will be&#xD;
      exchanged. Patients will be evaluated with neuropsychological tests and neurophysiological&#xD;
      measures of cholinergic transmission. Modulators of response, including cognitive reserve,&#xD;
      baseline impairment, apo-E genotype, MRI measures of atrophy and connectivity, electric field&#xD;
      modelling, will be considered.&#xD;

    <description>Participants are given a list of 15 unrelated words repeated over five different trials and are asked to repeat. Another list of 15 unrelated words are given and the patient must again repeat the original list of 15 words and then again after 30 minutes.&#xD;

    <description>The Face-Name Associative Memory Test is a cross-modal associative memory test, it includes 20 face-name pairs. The administration procedure starts with the presentation of 20 faces with each name and participants should read the name underneath the faces and try to learn each face-name pair. After 5 minutes, the faces are shown one by one and participants are asked to recall the associated names from 4 different names. The correct number of pairs recalled is recorded.&#xD;
The score ranges from 0 (worse performance) to 20 (best performance).</description>
