          1. Healthy young males or females between the ages of 21 to 45, inclusive (Cohorts 1, 2,&#xD;
             3 and 7; female subjects must not be pregnant or breastfeeding), and healthy elderly&#xD;
             males or females ≥ 65 years of age (Cohorts 4, 5, 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body mass index between 18 kg/m2 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive, and body weight of ≥50 kg&#xD;
             (110 pounds).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female subjects must be surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or&#xD;

             post-menopausal, or willing to use two barrier methods of contraception from initial&#xD;
             screening until one month after taking the last dose of study drug. Barrier methods of&#xD;
             contraception include diaphragm, cervical cap, male condom, female condom, and&#xD;
             spermicidal foam and sponges. Menopausal status declared by females in the young&#xD;
             cohorts will be verified by a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) test at Screening. In&#xD;
             addition, all females must have a negative pregnancy test within 48 hours before&#xD;
             dosing on Day 1 regardless of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male subjects must be willing to inform female partners of their participation in the&#xD;
             study and must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods (vasectomy performed at&#xD;
             least 6 months prior to dosing or use at least one barrier method of birth control).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able to understand the study procedures, voluntarily consent to participate in this&#xD;
             study, and provide written informed consent prior to start of any study-specific&#xD;

             history, vital signs, or physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;

             sitting values obtained at Screening, Day-1, or Day 1 predose. Out-of-range vital&#xD;
             signs may be repeated once during each eligibility assessment (prior to the start of&#xD;
             dosing on Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Marked bradycardia (heart rate ˂45 beats per minute [bpm]) or tachycardia (heart rate&#xD;
             ˃110 bpm) based on supine ECG values obtained at Screening, Day -1, or Day 1 predose.&#xD;
             Out-of-range vital signs may be repeated once at each eligibility assessment (prior to&#xD;
             the start of dosing on Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Current or past history of significant (in the Investigator's judgement)&#xD;
             cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, pulmonary, renal, or liver disease. Stable,&#xD;
             well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemias are allowed (see Exclusion #10).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of hematological disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia) in the immediate family&#xD;

             Other prescription or non-prescription drugs such as antihypertensive or cholesterol&#xD;
             lowering drugs are allowed if, in the Investigator's judgement, they would not&#xD;
             interfere with the test medication or the cognitive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any history of alcohol or drug abuse within the previous year prior to the Screening&#xD;

             positive alcohol result (upon admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. History of allergy to penicillin or sulfonamides, or any other clinically significant&#xD;
             drug allergy that includes symptoms such as shortness of breath, rash, or edema.&#xD;
