    <textblock>
      Today, with the prolongation of human life, the elderly population has increased and the&#xD;
      frequency of diseases seen in old age has increased due to this situation. The most common of&#xD;
      these diseases is Alzheimer's disease. The Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold (PLST) is a&#xD;
      conceptual model for reducing behavioral symptoms in individuals with dementia. In this&#xD;
      study, it is aimed to determine the effect of interventions according to Decreased Stress&#xD;
      Threshold Model on the level of neuropsychiatric symptoms and agitation of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      patient and caregivers care satisfaction and life satisfaction.&#xD;

      Today, with the prolongation of human life, the elderly population has increased and the&#xD;
      frequency of diseases seen in old age has increased due to this situation. The most common of&#xD;
      these diseases is Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disease which causes cognitive decline and various neuropsychiatric behavioral disorders and&#xD;
      disorders in daily living activities. The emergence of these symptoms of Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      leads to an increase in the costs of care provided and a great distress for caregivers. In&#xD;
      the literature, it is recommended to use nonpharmacological approaches as the first choice in&#xD;
      the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms. One of the non-pharmacological&#xD;
      approaches is the interventions according to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold&#xD;
      Model. In this method, taking into account the individuality of the patient, focusing on the&#xD;
      interaction of the Alzheimer's patient with the environment and the rearranging of the&#xD;
      environment for the reduction of cognitive abilities, focuses on creating a less stressful&#xD;
      environment. Since this model uses the steps of the nursing process, home visits are made.&#xD;
      This study will be carried out with Alzheimer's patients and caregivers from Aksaray&#xD;
      University Education and Research Hospital's Home Health Services unit. In this study, it is&#xD;
      aimed to determine the effect of interventions according to Decreased Stress Threshold Model&#xD;
      on the level of neuropsychiatric symptoms and agitation of Alzheimer's patient and caregivers&#xD;
      care satisfaction and life satisfaction.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>The Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold Model</intervention_name>
    <description>PLST is a conceptual model for reducing behavioral symptoms in individuals with dementia. The PLST model provides the foundation for a psychoeducational intervention that assists formal and informal caregivers in understanding behaviors and planning care for individuals with dementia. If the model is to be applied at home, at least three home visits are made in line with the listed principles. While making a diagnosis during the first home visit, a maintenance plan for the problems is created in other home visits and the caregiver is trained to implement the care plan. After the home visits, the process is carried out by providing counseling through telephone calls or face-to-face interviews when necessary.</description>
