    <textblock>
      Advances in modern anesthesiology have significantly reduced the risk of anesthesia compared&#xD;
      to the last century, however, the level of perioperative hospital mortality of planned&#xD;
      operations at the moment is on average about 0.5% (ISOS group, 2016). Weiser et al. (2016)&#xD;
      estimated that more than 313 million adults worldwide are subject to surgery each year. Thus,&#xD;
      the number of deaths may result in several million each year worldwide. However, the study of&#xD;
      the mortality risk is associated with certain difficulties, because over the past half&#xD;
      century, this figure has decreased a hundred times and the study requires studies that&#xD;
      include a large number of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current research focuses on other outcome criteria - postoperative complications. Thus,&#xD;
      anesthetic risk often refers to the risk of postoperative complications. The frequency of&#xD;
      these complications varies in a wide range, ranging from 3 to 18 % (Gawande AA, 1999, Kable&#xD;
      AK, 2002, Malik OS, 2018). The differences in the data are explained by the lack of clear&#xD;
      definitions and differences in the design of studies, but the fact that the development of&#xD;
      postoperative complications increases the risk of death several times (ISOS group, 2016) can&#xD;
      be considered undoubted. However, despite the importance of this issue, in modern literature&#xD;
      there is no clear idea of what is considered a high risk and which of the patients&#xD;
      corresponds to this category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding whether a patient is at high risk is an essential task - it allows you to&#xD;
      obtain meaningful informed consent of the patient, as well as to understand whether to apply&#xD;
      strategies for the prevention of complications (targeted infusion therapy, protective&#xD;
      respiratory support, especially monitoring in the postoperative period, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts at preoperative risk stratification have been made for many decades, some scales&#xD;
      estimate the initial physical status (ASA scale) (Young J, 2015) and predict mortality,&#xD;
      others estimate the risk of specific complications (Lee index, respiratory risk scale, etc.)&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scales including intraoperative and postoperative parameters such as the POSSUM series of&#xD;
      scales (Whiteley MS, 1996) are also being developed. The analysis shows that in routine&#xD;
      clinical practice, these scales are not used very often, due to their limitations:&#xD;
      subjectivity, technical complexity and often - low specificity and sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant diseases are the strongest predictors of postoperative adverse events and annual&#xD;
      mortality. Monk et al. (2005) demonstrated that Charlson's comorbidity score of 3 or more&#xD;
      significantly increased the risk of death. In addition, in most clinical studies, the&#xD;
      ASAclassification of physical status as a kind of comprehensive assessment of patient&#xD;
      comorbidity has repeatedly proved to be one of the strongest independent predictors of&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and mortality, despite the fact that this assessment is based on&#xD;
      subjective perception (Watt J., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main concomitant diseases that are independent predictors of perioperative complications&#xD;
      are diseases of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems (Van Diepen S, 2011). Increasing&#xD;
      age, anemia, obesity, diabetes - these conditions also increase the risk of an adverse&#xD;
      outcome. Diseases of the Central nervous system and neuromuscular diseases significantly&#xD;
      disrupt the function of respiration, can change the level of the Autonomous regulation of the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system, lead to significant cognitive disorders and nutritional deficiency,&#xD;
      which also increases the risk of perioperative complications (Hachenberg T, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, large-scale observational studies conducted in recent years in a number of&#xD;
      countries have not identified comorbidities as independent predictors of postoperative&#xD;
      complications (Malik, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, data on the risk effects of comorbidities are contradictory and may be influenced by&#xD;
      differences in the frequency and structure of these diseases in heterogeneous populations, as&#xD;
      well as in different treatment strategies for cardiovascular, respiratory and other diseases.&#xD;
      The identification of these risk factors is necessary to understand the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      complications and identify potential ways to reduce anesthetic risk, such as the correction&#xD;
      of concomitant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of risk of surgery, of course, depends not only on the presence of comorbidities&#xD;
      and their combinations, but also on the severity of surgical injury (Pearse RM, 2012, ISOS&#xD;
      group, 2017), as well as the level of exposure to drugs for anesthesia and anesthetic&#xD;
      techniques (Malik OS, 2018), therefore, the allocation of risk groups without these factors&#xD;
      is also not appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to assess the frequency and structure of comorbidities in patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery on the abdominal organs and to stratify the risk of postoperative complications by&#xD;
      determining independent&#xD;

      Order of conduct&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The data is registered in the Excel electronic database in a uniform format for all&#xD;
           centers (the form will be sent by the coordinator to all centers participating in the&#xD;
           study prior to the inclusion of patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All centers need to get approval by the local ethics committee before the start of the&#xD;
           study. The study protocol will be registered in Clinicaltrial.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The study includes all patients operated on within one operational day at the discretion&#xD;
           of the center and meeting the inclusion criteria with registration in the questionnaire&#xD;
           of the day of the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All patients could sign informed consent to participate in the study prior to inclusion&#xD;
           in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Before surgery, data on the patient and all studied factors specified in the study&#xD;
           protocol are entered into the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. All patients included in the study are monitored before discharge from the hospital with&#xD;
           registration of the data specified in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Every last day of the working week, all completed cases are sent as a separate Excel file&#xD;
      to the study coordinator by email to trembachnv@mail.ru 7. The originals of the&#xD;
      questionnaires are stored in the centers for the entire study time and for 3 years after its&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. The summary database is formed by the study coordinator and provided to the centers after&#xD;
      the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The sample size was calculated taking into account the fact that at&#xD;
      least 10 cases of postoperative complications per one factor included in the final regression&#xD;
      model are required. Given the wide range of complication rates in previous studies (from 3%&#xD;
      to 20%), we have chosen a lower bound for a more accurate assessment. To include 20 potential&#xD;
      risk factors in the regression model, 200 cases of postoperative complications are required,&#xD;
      which at a frequency of 3% is not less than 7000 people. Taking into account the risk of data&#xD;
      loss, and taking into account as many potential risk factors as possible, the size of the&#xD;
      required sample was increased to 12,000 people, which will also assess the contribution of&#xD;
      comorbidities to certain groups of complications. For validation of predictive models will be&#xD;
      recruited 4,000 additional. The inclusion of the patient in the main and validation group&#xD;
      will be carried out randomly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The character of distribution of studied parameters will be evaluated using the criterion&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov. The continuous data will be presented as the median and interquartile&#xD;
      range for the nonparametric distribution and as the mean and standard deviation for the&#xD;
      parametric distribution. Categorical variables will be presented as the number of patients&#xD;
      and a percentage of the total number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the initial assessment of the Association of the factor with postoperative complications,&#xD;
      a single-factor analysis using the χ2 criterion and the Mann-Whitney test will be carried&#xD;
      out. All variables with a reliable relationship identified in the univariate analysis (p less&#xD;
      than 0.05) will be included in logistic regression if there is no collinearity between them&#xD;
      (correlation coefficient less than 0.25). The logistic regression model will be constructed&#xD;
      using a step-by-step reverse inclusion procedure in which the presence of a complication will&#xD;
      be a dependent variable. Potential predictors will be removed if this exception does not&#xD;
      cause a significant change in the log likelihood ratio. The criterion for excluding the&#xD;
      factor will be set at the significance level of 0.05. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals will also be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting predictive model will be evaluated in the validation group using ROC analysis&#xD;
      and the Hosmer-Lemeshov test.&#xD;
