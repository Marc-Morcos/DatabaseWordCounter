        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitively normal subjects aged 65 to 90 years and prodromal to mild AD subjects aged&#xD;
             50 to 90 years, inclusive at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prodromal to moderate AD subjects: Meet the National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer's&#xD;
             Association (NIA-AA) core clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to&#xD;
             AD, probable AD dementia or AD dementia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0 (cognitively normal) or 0.5&#xD;
             (prodromal to moderate AD) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 10-30 inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have Aβ PET imaging demonstrating Aβ binding based on qualitative visual read at&#xD;
             screening or using an acceptable historical PET scan (cognitively normal subjects will&#xD;
             be assessed with Aβ PET at screening but will not be required to demonstrate Aβ&#xD;
             binding).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A brain MRI consistent with normal cognition or that supports a diagnosis of prodromal&#xD;
             to moderate AD, with no evidence of other significant neurologic pathology. A&#xD;
             previously acquired research MRI within the last 12 months may be used if deemed&#xD;
             acceptable by the investigator and no significant clinically relevant changes have&#xD;
             occurred since the prior MRI was obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has an appropriate study partner capable of participating in CDR&#xD;
             assessment and, if necessary, of accompanying the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For cognitively normal subjects only: History of at least one first degree relative&#xD;
             with diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (self-reported by the potential subject and/or&#xD;
             confirmed by the study partner).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior history of any alcohol or drug abuse within the last 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior participation in other research protocols or clinical care in the last year in&#xD;
             addition to the radiation exposure expected from participation in this clinical study,&#xD;
             such that radiation exposure exceeds the effective dose of 50 millisievert (mSv),&#xD;
             which would be above the acceptable annual limit established by the US Federal&#xD;
             Guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal,&#xD;
             hematological, neoplastic, endocrine, alternative neurological, immunodeficiency,&#xD;
             pulmonary, or other disorder or disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI evidence of cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease, space-occupying lesions,&#xD;
             normal pressure hydrocephalus, or other central nervous system (CNS) disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implants that have not been certified for MRI or history of claustrophobia in MRI,&#xD;
             unless an acceptable previously acquired research MRI is available&#xD;
