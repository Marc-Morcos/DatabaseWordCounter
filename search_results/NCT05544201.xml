  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in ageing population and patients with&#xD;
      age-related neurodegenerative diseases, which severely affect cognition and even lead to&#xD;
      accumulated amyloid-β (Aβ). At present, non-pharmacological interventions for sleep&#xD;
      disturbances in dementia patients are accepted as first line of treatment, of which the&#xD;
      evidence from clinical trials is very limited. Encouraging results from recent studies on&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed moderate positive effects on sleep&#xD;
      quality in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared to tDCS, high-definition&#xD;
      transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS) enables the entrainment of neuronal&#xD;
      activities with optimized focality through injecting small electric current with a specific&#xD;
      frequency and has significant enhancement effects on slow wave activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The investigators aim to 1) investigate and compare the safety, efficacy and&#xD;
      sustainability of 40 Hz HD-tACS and HD-tDCS over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)&#xD;
      in mild neurocognitive disorder due to AD (NCD-AD) patients with sleep disturbances; 2)&#xD;
      examine the relationship between the changes in sleep quality, cognitive function and saliva&#xD;
      Aβ levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Chinese right-handed mild NCD-AD patients with sleep disturbances (aged from 60 to&#xD;
      90 years) will be randomly assigned to a 4-week intervention of either HD-tACS, HD-tDCS, or&#xD;
      sham HD-tCS, with 33 participants per arm. Before intervention, structural magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) data is used to construct individual realistic head model. Comprehensive&#xD;
      assessments, including sleep quality, cognitive performance and saliva Aβ levels will be&#xD;
      conducted at baseline, 4th week, 8th week, 12th week and 24th week. Program adherence and&#xD;
      adverse effects will be monitored throughout intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The primary outcomes will be the changes in sleep quality and memory&#xD;
      performance with modality-driven paradigms (HD-tACS, HD-tDCS, sham HD-tCS), and comparisons&#xD;
      of group differences across different time points. Secondary outcomes will be the changes&#xD;
      objective sleep pattern, global cognition, saliva Aβ levels and quality of life.&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat analysis will be carried out. Changes of efficacy indicators from baseline&#xD;
      to each follow up point will be tested with mixed effect model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This study aims to investigate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of HD-tACS&#xD;
      and HD-tDCS over left DLPFC for sleep disturbances and cognitive dysfunction in mild NCD-AD&#xD;
      patients. It wills also test the program adherence, tolerability and adverse effects of this&#xD;
      innovative neurotechonology. Information will be helpful for in-depth understanding the&#xD;
      relationship of &quot;sleep disturbances-amyloid deposition&quot; and guiding the further studies of&#xD;
      sleep medicine and neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;

    <measure>Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a 19-item questionnaire that includes seven areas of subjective sleep quality and patterns in adults over the last month including the following components: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, SDs, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction (Buysse et al., 1988). Each item in the scale is scored from 0 to 3 scale (0 = no difficulty; 3 = severe difficulty). The scores are added to yield a global score ranging from 0 to 21 (0 = no difficulty; 21 = severe difficulties in all areas). This scale has good reliability and validity psychometrics and is widely used in research: Cronbach's alpha (0.77 to 0.83), sensitivity (89.6%), specificity (86.5%)(Buysse et al., 1988). Greater score of PSQI indicates worse sleep quality.</description>

    <description>Word-list learning test (WLLT), consisting of sixteen semantically non-associated words, is presented consecutively over three free trials of immediate recall, a 20-min delayed recall (to prevent recency effects) (Lu et al., 2018). The raw numbers of words recalled are used to assess the memory function.</description>
