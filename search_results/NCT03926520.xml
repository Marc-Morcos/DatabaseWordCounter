    <textblock>
      This study will explore the efficacy of ECT treatments plus usual care (ECT+UC), relative to&#xD;
      a placebo simulated ECT plus usual care (S-ECT+UC) in reducing severe agitation in patients&#xD;
      with moderate to severe dementia including Alzheimer's Disease, Vascular dementia,&#xD;
      Frontotemporal dementia, and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. The study will also determine the&#xD;
      tolerability/safety outcomes of ECT+UC relative to S-ECT+UC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single blind, randomized, Simulated-ECT (S-ECT) controlled trial of&#xD;
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The purpose is to determine the efficacy and safety of ECT&#xD;
      for severe agitation in patients with moderate to severe dementia including Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease, Vascular dementia, Frontotemporal dementia, and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, while&#xD;
      also examining the durability of the acute treatment effect in an exploratory maintenance&#xD;
      naturalistic design. The investigators will study only inpatients with severe agitation and&#xD;
      moderate to severe dementia, associated with high care costs and poor quality of life, who&#xD;
      typically have already failed prior trials of psychotropic medications. The first aim is to&#xD;
      compare the relative efficacy of up to 9 ECT treatments plus usual care (ECT+UC) versus&#xD;
      Simulated ECT (S-ECT+UC) in reducing severe agitation in 200 participants with moderate to&#xD;
      severe dementia including Alzheimer's Disease, Vascular dementia, Frontotemporal dementia,&#xD;
      and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. The second aim is to compare the relative tolerability/safety&#xD;
      outcomes of ECT+UC versus S-ECT+UC in the same group of participants. The exploratory aim is&#xD;
      to understand the stability of agitation reduction (CMAI) and global functioning (Clinical&#xD;
      Global Impression-Severity [CGI-S]) with assessments at 1,3, and 6 months following the&#xD;
      randomized phase, and then for a fourth visit 12 months after the randomized phase.&#xD;
      Establishing safety and efficacy of ECT for severe agitation in dementias provides an&#xD;
      opportunity to decrease long-term care placement, decrease the risk of mortality, decrease&#xD;
      caregiver burden, and enhance quality of life for patients and their caregivers.&#xD;

    <measure>CMAI total score</measure>
    <time_frame>The CMAI will be collected through study completion, about 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CMAI measures the efficacy of ECT+UC in reducing severe agitation in AD subjects than S-ECT. The CMAI is a 29-item scale with each item ranging from 1-7 in frequency with 7 being the highest and therefore worst outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change Scale (ADCS-CGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>The ADCS-CGIC will be collected for one month</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS-CGIC gives a discrete score that ranges from 1-7 with 7 being the worst outcome.</description>

    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Clinician Version (NPI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>The NPI-C will be collected for one month</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI-C is an improved version of the NPI composed of several domains of which we will use Agitation and Aggression, as well as their sum. The higher the frequency and/or severity within each domain, the worse the condition of the patient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Agitation Scale (PAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The PAS will be collected for one month</time_frame>
    <description>The PAS assesses four behavioral domains. Each domain has an intensity score ranging from 0-4 with 4 being the worst outcome.</description>

    <description>Stimulus method of delivery will be RUL electrode placement, and ultra-brief (UB) pulse width (0.25-0.37ms). At the first ECT session, seizure threshold (ST) will be determined by titration with the empirical dose titration method and subsequent treatments will be approximately 6 times the ST. Following other NIMH sponsored multicenter ECT studies (PRIDE, U01 MH055495), stimulus settings will be adjusted as needed during the ECT course based on seizure quality and treatment efficacy. Participants will be administered anesthesia.</description>

    <description>The participant is brought to the ECT suite for the length a session would normally take (approximately 2 hours). While in the ECT suite, conducting gel will be placed on the scalp of the S-ECT subjects to parallel the ECT procedures in the ECT active group. An IV will be placed to provide PRN medication and fluids as needed. IV placement will also provide a method for study staff to assess physical interference and subject resistance to treatment. Participants will not be administered anesthesia.</description>
