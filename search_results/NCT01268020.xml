  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The underlying goal of this study is to assess [18F]-FMH3 PET imaging as a tool to evaluate&#xD;
      the activity of the H3 receptor in the brain of Alzheimer Disease (AD) research participants&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10 subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD) and 8 healthy control (HC)subjects will&#xD;
      be recruited to participate in this study. All subjects will undergo written informed consent&#xD;
      and a screening evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline&#xD;
      physical and neurological evaluation and baseline cognitive evaluations. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to undergo a bolus injection of [18F]-FMH3. Subjects will undergo serial PET imaging&#xD;
      scans and plasma sampling for measurement of [18F]-FMH3 in plasma (both protein bound and&#xD;
      free) over a period of up to 8 hours. The primary imaging outcome measure will be the brain&#xD;
      regional distribution volumes expressed as a brain tissue to plasma ratio of the radioligand,&#xD;
      [18F]-FMH3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 2 weeks following the initial imaging visit, subjects may be asked to return for a&#xD;
      second injection and scanning procedure to evaluate the reproducibility of the imaging&#xD;
      measure using this procedure. Subjects may decline to participate in the second scan.&#xD;
