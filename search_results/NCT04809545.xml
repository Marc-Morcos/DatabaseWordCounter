  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last few decades, insights into the impact of the sonic environment on persons have&#xD;
      grown to include not only the adverse effects of extensive mechanical noise but also the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of a well-designed sonic environment. People with dementia, however,&#xD;
      perceive and understand the sonic environment differently. The most obvious difference is&#xD;
      that the meanings they may give to the sounds they notice due to changing mental&#xD;
      associations. However, also at an earlier perceptual stage, attention focusing and gating may&#xD;
      be affected, reducing their ability to analyze a complex auditory scene. Behaviour associated&#xD;
      with the appraisal of the sound environment may change with the emergence of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the effect size of a carefully tuned personalized&#xD;
      sonic environment (delivered via AcustiCare) on agitation and distress (NPI and PAS), night&#xD;
      sleep and stress (Via wristband) and on quality of life (QUALIDEM) in a population of older&#xD;
      adults with dementia and behavioural symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown the positive effect of natural and non-natural soundscape on people with&#xD;
      severe or profound intellectual disabilities (Andringa &amp; van den Bosch, 2013). Sound plays a&#xD;
      role in generating a feeling of safety, in influencing the mood, and triggering a specific&#xD;
      action. Bringing sound with this purpose, as targeted to the current activity can improve the&#xD;
      behaviour. There is substantial research on the effect of noise (unwanted sound) on people's&#xD;
      health and well-being. The health outcomes vary, but include cardiovascular disease, sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, and annoyance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study in people with dementia by the Belgian investigators in this study (Devos&#xD;
      et al., 2019), they observed positive staff outcome measures, reflecting the value of the&#xD;
      soundscape in improving their ability to provide care to people with dementia. They did not&#xD;
      directly assess the benefits to residents in that study. There were no harms documented in&#xD;
      the study, and if residents reacted not well to specific sound, the sound was removed from&#xD;
      the soundscape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to build upon the previous research and evaluate the effect of a&#xD;
      personalized soundscape on the well-being and behaviour of persons with dementia. In the&#xD;
      soundscapes, we use only recognizable sounds, sounds that give persons with dementia a&#xD;
      feeling of 'safety' or sounds that focus on the orientation (in time, place). We try to add a&#xD;
      recognizable (safe, orientating) sound through the soundscape system. This soundscape&#xD;
      supports the environment and makes the environment feel safer and more 'clear' for residents&#xD;
      with dementia. In the previous research through co-design process with staff and family&#xD;
      member the sounds were chosen (Devos et al, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the existing studies in the field of the acoustic environment in health care are&#xD;
      descriptive, and there is a need for a more rigorous evaluation of interventions. By using a&#xD;
      pilot Randomized Control Trial (RCT) design, we will be able to establish the effect size of&#xD;
      soundscape on outcomes of interest in this population of people with dementia. These results&#xD;
      will support evidence-based practices by healthcare providers, architects, engineers and&#xD;
      designers in implementing environmental health factors and designing better care facilities&#xD;
      for people with dementia in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is thus to determine the effect size of a carefully tuned&#xD;
      personalized sonic environment (delivered via AcustiCare) on agitation and distress (NPI and&#xD;
      PAS), night sleep and stress (Via wristband) and on quality of life (QUALIDEM).&#xD;
