      The purpose of this study was to determine whether a low dose an opiate pain medication is&#xD;
      effective for the treatment of discomfort in patients with advanced dementia. The study&#xD;
      medication was also known as Lortab and contained both a narcotic pain medication and&#xD;
      acetaminophen (the same pain medication as contained in Tylenol). This study was an&#xD;
      eight-week long clinical trial for discomfort among veterans with advanced dementia who were&#xD;
      admitted to a Nursing Home Care Unit (NHCU) at the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the Low-Dose Opiate Therapy for Discomfort in Dementia&#xD;
      (L-DOT) project was to determine whether low-dose opiates are effective and well tolerated&#xD;
      for the treatment of pain (as manifest by discomfort) in patients with advanced dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN: This study was a two-week double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      crossover trial of low-dose hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Lortab) for discomfort among veterans&#xD;
      with a dementia, followed by six weeks of open-label therapy for patients who tolerated&#xD;
      treatment during the first two weeks (eight weeks total treatment on study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY: After consent, patients over age 55 with dementia residing in a nursing home&#xD;
      care unit (or at home who receive care) at Tuscaloosa VAMC who demonstrate significant&#xD;
      discomfort (as measured by the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia - PAINAD) were randomized&#xD;
      to one of two groups, using a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, crossover&#xD;
      design. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either hydrocodone/acetaminophen&#xD;
      2.5mg/250mg q8hrs scheduled with placebo q8hrs PRN or placebo q8hrs scheduled with&#xD;
      hydrocodone/acetaminophen 2.5mg/250mg q8hrs PRN. After one week's treatment, patients were&#xD;
      crossed over to the other (opposite) regimen, for a total of two weeks of blinded treatment.&#xD;
      Patients who tolerated treatment with hydrocodone/acetaminophen were eligible for a six-week,&#xD;
      open-label continuation phase. The primary outcome measure was pain/discomfort. Preliminary&#xD;
      sample size calculations indicated that 42 patients (48 patients accounting for dropouts)&#xD;
      would be needed to be enrolled over three years to detect a difference between treatments&#xD;
      with power of .80 and two-tailed alpha of .05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE: There is evidence that pain is both under recognized and undertreated in long&#xD;
      term care settings. This study hoped to make a significant contribution to the evidence base&#xD;
      for a common and problematic situation among veterans with advanced dementia. Advances in&#xD;
      pain and symptom control are central to the improvement of palliative care intervention for&#xD;
      dementia patients. Low-dose opiates are the logical next category of analgesics to consider,&#xD;
      but have been rarely studied for this purpose in this population.&#xD;

          <description>This is a fully crossed study, each participant serves as his own control. Phase A: Participants are randomized to either A1 for 1 week then A2 for 1 week OR A2 for 1 week then A1 for one week. A1: hydrocodone/acetaminophen 2.5/167 mg per 5 ml liquid TID, with liquid placebo available PRN. A2: liquid placebo TID with hydrocodone/acetaminophen 2.5/167 mg per 5 ml liquid PRN.&#xD;
Phase B: If tolerated study medication during Phase A (i.e., the closed label, double-blind phase of the trial) then enter a six-week, open-label phase. Participants judged as responders during Phase A continue the same dose of study medication. Otherwise, moved to a higher dose (hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/500mg TID or the most appropriate formulary alternative). Participant can also receive up to 2 PRN administrations at the same dose levels as listed above, but not to exceed 2.5g of acetaminophen.</description>
