  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involves repeated doses of LY3303560 given by injection for 25 weeks. The study&#xD;
      will examine how safe repeated doses of LY3303560 are, whether they cause side effects in&#xD;
      participants with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's Disease, and how LY3303560 is&#xD;
      handled by the body and acts in the body. This study will last up to 64 weeks, not including&#xD;
      screening. Screening is required within 90 days prior to the start of the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or mild-to-moderate AD&#xD;
             based on National Institute of Aging and Alzheimer's Association diagnostic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants: women not of child-bearing potential may participate, and include&#xD;

             of consciousness within the last 5 years or any seizure; prior electroencephalogram&#xD;

             pacemaker&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of intracranial haemorrhage, cerebrovascular aneurysm, or arteriovenous&#xD;

             therapy for less than 4 weeks, or have less than 4 weeks of stable therapy on these&#xD;
             treatments by time of randomisation (including less than 4 weeks since stopping AChEIs&#xD;
             and/or memantine); or have received medications that affect the central nervous&#xD;
             system, except treatments for AD, for less than 4 weeks at a stable dose&#xD;

          -  Are currently using or intend to use drugs known to significantly prolong the QT&#xD;
             interval, or who have a known risk factor for Torsades de Pointes. A participant will&#xD;
             not be excluded if they have been using stable medication that is known to potentially&#xD;
             cause significant prolongation of the QT interval, but does not present with any&#xD;
             clinically significant prolongation of the QT interval at screening, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
