  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to quantify the brain distribution of the nicotinic receptors in&#xD;
      human volunteers and their alterations in patients suffering from neurological diseases such&#xD;
      as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases and familial epilepsy. This will be done using Postron&#xD;
      Emission Tomography (PET) and a new radiotracer of the nicotinic receptors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PET is a non -invasive technique that allow to study, in vivo in human, the neurotransmission&#xD;
      system. Thanks to the development of radiotracers that are selective for the binding site of&#xD;
      the neurotransmitter, several system have been studied such as the dopaminergic, GABAergic&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the in vivo study of the cholinergic system, was hampered the lack of suitable&#xD;
      radiotracer. The cholinergic system is an important neurotransmitter system in human brain&#xD;
      which exact rule remains unclear. It is involved in cognition, and memory and it is altered&#xD;
      early in several neurodegeneratives diseases such as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nicotinic receptors are one target of the cholinergic neurotransmission (together with&#xD;
      muscarinic receptors), that are of importance since postmortem studies have showed their&#xD;
      early alteration in neurodegeneratives diseases. Moreover, as they are located mostly on&#xD;
      presynaptic part of the cholinergic terminations, their labelling can be of great interest&#xD;
      for the study of the integrity of the cholinergic fibres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-mortem studies have shown a reduction of the nicotinic receptors density in Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease in temporal cortex and hippocampus. Similarly, in Parkinson's diseases, nicotinic&#xD;
      receptor density have been shown to be reduced in fronto-temporal cortex and in&#xD;
      pedoculo-pontin nuclei. Recently, point mutation on nicotinic receptor sub-units (alpha4 or&#xD;
      beta2) have been objectived in a familial epilepsy: the Autosomic Dominant Noctural Frontal&#xD;
      Lobe Epilepsy (ADNFLE). Nicotinic receptor are also involved in tobacco addiction, as they&#xD;
      are the main brain target of the nicotine from the cigarette smoking. Human post-mortem&#xD;
      studies and animal models suggest that nicotinic receptor density is increased in chronic&#xD;
      smoker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in vivo study of these receptors will bring new insight in the understanding of the&#xD;
      physiopathology of nicotinic receptor in several neurodegeneratives diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radioligand that will be used is the2- F-A-85380 labelled with fluorin-18, a fluoro&#xD;
      derivative of the A85380 (Abbott compound). The 2-F-A-85380 present a high affinity and high&#xD;
      selectivity for the alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor subtype, which is the major nicotinic&#xD;
      receptor subtype in the brain. Radiolabelling, with fluorin-18 (half-life=110 min) performed&#xD;
      in our laboratory, allow produciton of a high specific activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This compound has been studied extensively in rodent and in monkey using PET. The low&#xD;
      toxicity of this compound allow its use as a radiotracer in human.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject between 18 and 85 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history and physical examination, psychological assessment, and blood&#xD;
      and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in the study participate in one of the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 : Quantification in normal non-smoker and smokers subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two catheters (small plastic tubes) are placed into veins in the subject's arms for injecting&#xD;
      [18F]FA85380 and for collecting blood samples during the scan. A third catheter is placed&#xD;
      into a wrist artery to obtain arterial blood during the scan. With the catheters in place,&#xD;
      the subject lies down on the scanner bed with his or her head placed in a special mask that&#xD;
      limits movement during the brain scan. The scan begins with an initial transmission scan to&#xD;
      measure tissue attenuation for about 15 minutes, after which the [18F]FA85380 is injected and&#xD;
      the actual PET scan starts. The entire procedure takes about 4 hours, including 2.5 hours of&#xD;
      continuous scanning sessions, during which the subject is required to lie still. The second&#xD;
      scan period start after one hour rest period where subjects can relax out of the scanner, and&#xD;
      last 30 minutes. They are monitored throughout the procedure. Vital signs are measured and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram is taken before and after injection of the tracer. At the end of the&#xD;
      scanning, additional blood and urine samples are collected. Subjects are asked to urinate&#xD;
      after each scanning session to lessen the radioactivity in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 Parkinson disease :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PET scan using [18F]FA85380 is the same as in Part 1. A second PET procedure using&#xD;
      [18F]FDOPA is performed the day after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 Alzheimer disease This part of the study is the same as Part 1, except that no&#xD;
      arterial catheter is placed. A second PET procedure is performed using [18F]FDG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 4 Epilepsy ADNFLE This part of the study is the same as Part 3.&#xD;
