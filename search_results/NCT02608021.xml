  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a study to validate Neurotrack's visual paired comparison task, aimed&#xD;
      at early detection and monitoring of memory impairment. The investigators will determine&#xD;
      whether the novel task developed by Neurotrack is associated with markers of brain pathology&#xD;
      associated with very early Alzheimer's disease. The elderly subjects studied will be&#xD;
      cognitively normal (CN) or have amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). For the current&#xD;
      study, the primary brain pathology parameters will be derived from MRI scans. Data from this&#xD;
      study will be correlated with data from a parallel study designed to validate a larger group&#xD;
      of new cognitive tasks by correlating test performance with a broader array of biomarkers of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Neurotrack test has the potential to dramatically alter the current methods used for&#xD;
      detecting cognitive deficits. Patients and research subjects could be screened for medial&#xD;
      temporal lobe (MTL) impairment using inexpensive, widely available, safe, and non-invasive&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be elderly individuals who are participating in ongoing research at the NYU&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease Center (ADC) and who have received the standard ADC clinical evaluation&#xD;
      within the past year, including a medical-neurological evaluation, neuro-psychological&#xD;
      assessment and structural neuroimaging (MRI). As part of the current study, all subjects will&#xD;
      receive both the Neurotrack Visual Paired-Comparison (VPC) Task and MRI scans. The current&#xD;
      protocol strictly for a research study and there will be no &quot;standard care&quot; provided.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to come in for two separate sessions. The first session will&#xD;
      involve screening to confirm eligibility and administration of the cognitive testing&#xD;
      procedures, while the second session will involve the MRI protocol.&#xD;

    <description>Eye fixation is defined as a point of gaze continually remaining within 1 degree of visual angle for a period of 100 milliseconds or more. Investigators will analyze the fixations that occur within 2 designated areas of interest (AOIs): the area of the novel image and the area of the familiar image.</description>

        Individuals will be recruited from among participants at the NYU Alzheimer's Disease Center&#xD;
        ADC, at the affiliated Center for Brain Health (CBH), and from other ongoing NYU research&#xD;
        studies of the Center for Cognitive Neurology (CCN) that are affiliated with the ADC and&#xD;
        for which participants receive the standard ADC research diagnostic assessment (the ADC&#xD;
        Clinical Evaluation).&#xD;
