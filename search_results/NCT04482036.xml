  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether it is possible and useful for&#xD;
      caregivers to report behavioral or psychological symptoms of people with mild memory problems&#xD;
      or Alzheimer's disease through a smartphone mobile application. The investigators believe&#xD;
      that monitoring these symptoms and having a tool, like a mobile application, can provide&#xD;
      quicker accessibility to the patient's clinical care team, which could improve care for&#xD;
      patients and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These types of symptoms found in patients with mild memory problems or Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      are any type of psychiatric symptoms or abnormal behaviors one might develop as the result of&#xD;
      these brain illnesses. Examples of psychological and behavioral symptoms are depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, insomnia, irritability, agitation, and hallucinations. These symptoms differ from&#xD;
      regular psychiatric symptoms, because they are caused by mild memory problems or Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD). These symptoms can cause a lot of distress for patients and caregivers, and can&#xD;
      lead to greater use of healthcare services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a part of this research study the patient and caregiver will undergo randomization, &quot;like&#xD;
      flipping a coin&quot;, to assign the patient and caregiver to one of two research study groups.&#xD;
      The patient and the partnered caregiver will join the same group. The group will either&#xD;
      receive: 1) three in-person assessments on symptoms and behaviors that the patient may&#xD;
      experience and a mobile application that will send surveys to the caregiver in order to rate&#xD;
      the presence, severity and stress caused by these symptoms and behaviors; or 2) three&#xD;
      in-person assessments on symptoms and behaviors that the patient may experience and no mobile&#xD;
      application. The outcomes of these surveys and assessments will then be shared with the&#xD;
      patient's clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the caregiver is assigned to the group that receives the mobile application they will&#xD;
      receive the surveys either weekly or monthly. After each month of completing the surveys, the&#xD;
      frequency will change. Depending on feedback from the first 10 participants, the&#xD;
      investigators may modify the survey rate to happen more than weekly.&#xD;

    <measure>Feasibility of the BrainCare Notes (BCN) app - Caregiver Completion Rate of the Neuropsychiatric Interview Questionnaire (NPI-Q) at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Calculated at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of the BrainCare Notes (BCN) app will be measured by the number of completed Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) surveys that were initiated from scheduled BCN app prompts divided by the total number of scheduled BCN prompts sent over a 3 month span. Caregivers will be prompted via the BCN app to complete the NPI-Q app at different intervals (e.g. daily, weekly).&#xD;
The NPI-Q measures Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) and is completed by a caregiver. There are 12 domains that focus on a different and specific BPSD (e.g. depression, hallucinations). Symptom severity scores for each of the symptom domains range between 0-not present, 1 - mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe. The summation of all symptom severity scores have a range of a min score of 0 and max score of 36. A higher number indicates worse symptom severity.</description>

    <description>Feasibility of the BrainCare Notes (BCN) app will be measured by averaging participants answers to the following likert style, survey burden question for the BCN app, &quot;How burdensome was completion of the prior survey? (Answer options: not at all burdensome - 1, mildly burdensome - 2, moderately burdensome - 3, or extremely burdensome - 4)&quot;.&#xD;
Participants are prompted to answer the survey burden question after completion of each BCN app prompted survey. Using the associated number with each likert answer, all survey burden question results will be averaged at the time of 3 months.</description>

    <description>The System Usability Scale (SUS) will be used to assess usability of the BrainCare Notes (BCN) app at 3 months. The SUS is a ten-item attitude Likert scale that provides a global view of subjective assessments of usability. John Brooke developed and validated the SUS in 1986.&#xD;
The 10 items cover topics of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. The SUS items use a 5-point likert scale, with the answer &quot;strongly disagree&quot; being represented by a &quot;1&quot; and &quot;strongly agree&quot; by a &quot;5&quot;.</description>

    <description>Change in Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) will be calculated by subtracting the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) scores at 3 months from the NPI-Q scores at baseline. The NPI-Q is a questionnaire administered by a research team member and completed by a caregiver who cares for a person with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia. There are 12 domains that focus on a different and specific BPSD (e.g. depression, hallucinations).&#xD;
Symptom severity scores for each of the symptom domain range between 0-not present, 1 - mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe. The summation of all symptom severity scores have a range of a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 36, where the higher the number indicates worse symptom severity.</description>
