  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several previous studies have assessed acetylcholine (Ach) and acetylcholinesterase activity&#xD;
      (AchE-a) levels in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      Ach level was significantly decreased in AD patients, and correlated positively with dementia&#xD;
      score and MMSE (1, 2). Two studies have demonstrated positive correlations between CSF AchE-a&#xD;
      and CSF Tau, phosphorylated-Tau (P-Tau) and AB 1-42 peptide (3,4). ChEIs (cholinesterase&#xD;
      inhibitors) have been approved for the treatment of AD but only 20 to 30 % of patients are&#xD;
      responders (5). Any consistent data allow the clinician to predict the response to the&#xD;
      treatment. The link between basal cholinergic status and ChEIs efficiency has never been&#xD;
      done. Even if, there is a wild research in AD treatment, ChEIs or treatment acting on the Ach&#xD;
      pathways will remain a long time valuable treatment particularly in moderate AD in which&#xD;
      disease modifying therapies did not show any efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators's objective is to prospectively explore the predicting value of CSF Ach and&#xD;
      AchE-a levels on ChEIs response in AD patients.&#xD;

      Strategy: Within the framework of the usual management, the investigators propose the&#xD;
      protocol to patients who had an assay of the CSF biomarkers with a CSF AD biological profile&#xD;
      before the introduction of an IChEs and having accepted Their CSF will stocked in our&#xD;
      biobank. Patients will only have additional neuropsychological assessments. The rest of the&#xD;
      care comes under the current care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantification of ACh in the CSF will be performed in tandem mass spectrometry after&#xD;
      separation by liquid chromatography (LC-MS / MS). AChE activity will be determined by&#xD;
      colorimetric determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators's objective is to prospectively explore the predicting value of CSF Ach and&#xD;
      AchE-a levels on ChEIs response in AD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation criteria will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference of the mean value of the ACh level and AChE activity in the CSF between the&#xD;
           responder and non-respondier groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Responder&quot; patients are defined by an improvement of at least 4 points on the ADAS-Cog&#xD;
           (cognitive part) ADAS-Cog after 6 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Non-responders&quot; are defined as aggravation, lack of improvement or improvement &lt;4&#xD;
           points on the ADAS-Cog scale.&#xD;
