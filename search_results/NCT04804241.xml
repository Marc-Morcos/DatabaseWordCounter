  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development of novel disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains of&#xD;
      paramount importance. This study will be a Phase II randomized clinical trial testing&#xD;
      Senicapoc in patients with mild or prodromal AD. This will be a small Proof of Mechanism&#xD;
      study to prove biological activity and target engagement in humans with early AD. The&#xD;
      investigators will study up to 55 patients over 52 weeks, with primary outcomes being&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores and blood and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of neuroinflammation. This pilot study will provide an&#xD;
      estimate of treatment effect size on cognitive trajectory, daily function, and brain atrophy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study up to 55 patients (3:1 active treatment with 10 mg/day&#xD;
      maintenance dose: placebo) over 52 weeks in either the Sacramento or East Bay locations the&#xD;
      University of California Davis Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), with cognitive&#xD;
      outcomes, blood, and CSF markers of neuroinflammation. This pilot study will provide an&#xD;
      estimate of treatment effect size on cognitive trajectory, daily function, and brain atrophy.&#xD;
      The trial will last 1 year (52 weeks on 10 mg/day of active drug or placebo) with primary&#xD;
      efficacy measures at baseline, week 26, and week 52. Additional safety monitoring visits will&#xD;
      occur at weeks 4, 12, and 36 including physical exams, measurement of blood pressure, vital&#xD;
      signs, safety labs, electrocardiogram recordings, collection of Adverse Events and&#xD;
      Concomitant Medications. The study will culminate with a visit at 78 weeks (26 weeks after&#xD;
      last dose, allowing full wash-out from the central nervous system (CNS)) to test if the&#xD;
      previously treated and untreated groups show any differences, as would be expected if&#xD;
      Senicapoc treatment for 1 year was disease-modifying. All participants will be required to&#xD;
      participate in either the CSF Sub-study or the Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET)&#xD;
      Sub-study. All participants will be required to participate in the Cognitive Event Related&#xD;
      Potential (ERP) Sub-study.&#xD;

    <description>The CSRT is widely used to identify mild dementia and measure associative learning and memory. It involves a study phase where subjects identify pictured items in response to category cures. This is followed by a free recall period and then a cued recall period where category cues are presented to the subjects. The raw score for the CSRT is 0 to 48 (16 items with 3 recall trials). The combined scores when combining the Free plus Cued Recall trials is 0 to 96. The higher the score, the less cognitive impairment and the better the outcome.</description>

             mild AD dementia. Diagnoses are made by a comprehensive case conference review for all&#xD;
             participants in the ADRC longitudinal cohort and all CADC referrals, resulting in a&#xD;
             consensus diagnosis made according to current research criteria. For patients referred&#xD;
             from other clinics, the case will be reviewed by a study physician and&#xD;
             neuropsychologist and only patients who satisfy criteria for probable AD (McKhann et&#xD;

             LP. Safety will be determined by the participant's Primary Care Provider and study PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For those who take antiplatelet therapy intermittently (e.g. aspirin as needed for&#xD;
             pain), the investigators will exclude any doses within 48 hours of the LP or more than&#xD;
