      This study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program&#xD;
      for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage&#xD;
      agitation/aggression. The Investigators will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver&#xD;
      program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and&#xD;
      discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use. The results will help in expanding access to&#xD;
      and delivery of empirically supported behavioral health services for caregivers and people&#xD;
      with dementia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more&#xD;
      than 5 million Americans in 2014. With aging of the population it is projected that 8.4&#xD;
      million people will be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs&#xD;
      attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than 1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and&#xD;
      Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) (anxiety, agitation, depression) are common and&#xD;
      often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs,&#xD;
      discomfort, or frustration. BPSD are disturbing and frequently lead to caregivers seeking&#xD;
      medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more&#xD;
      than doubles mortality risk; however, many caregivers are willing to accept those risks. The&#xD;
      Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics&#xD;
      Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD.&#xD;
      STAR-Caregivers is an efficacious first-line behavioral treatment, endorsed by the&#xD;
      Administration on Aging, that involves caregiver training to manage BPSD. However, the&#xD;
      program has not been implemented widely - partly due to the cost of the programs, difficulty&#xD;
      conducting outreach, and modality of training (in person with written materials). Adequate&#xD;
      caregiver training and commensurate reduction in caregiver burden are the mediators&#xD;
      (mechanisms) the Investigators will engage in this Stage III trial to reduce BPSD and&#xD;
      discontinue antipsychotic medication use by PWD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STAR-Caregivers program is an education, training, and support intervention demonstrated&#xD;
      efficacious in reducing BPSD. The original program involved 8 face-to-face, in-home training&#xD;
      sessions and 4 follow-up phone calls. The condensed version involves 4 in-home sessions with&#xD;
      2 phone follow-ups.18 Neither of these is feasible from a payer perspective. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to test a self-directed, remote version called STAR-virtual training&#xD;
      and follow-up (STAR-VTF) that leverages secure email within the member portal at Kaiser&#xD;
      Permanente Washington to improve access to training, fidelity to the STAR principles, and to&#xD;
      lower the cost of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a Stage III trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      STAR-VTF in which (a) caregiver training materials are delivered electronically and learning&#xD;
      is self-directed, (b) caregivers have one orientation phone visit with a social worker and&#xD;
      (c) where caregivers receive ongoing support from a social worker via telephone and secure&#xD;
      messaging in the web-based member portal. Investigators will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF&#xD;
      group to an attention control group (mailed material, links to websites, and generic secure&#xD;
      messages).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of conducting caregiver outreach, training,&#xD;
      and support via social workers including: (1) willingness of caregivers to interact primarily&#xD;
      through secure messaging (contact rates); and (2) willingness of caregivers to complete&#xD;
      self-directed training (training completion rates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective&#xD;
      including: (1) average time spent per home-visit (including preparation and travel time); (2)&#xD;
      average time per month spent responding to caregiver emails and coordinating care with&#xD;
      primary care physicians; and (3 differences in face-to-face primary care, urgent care, and&#xD;
      emergency department visit rates by PWD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower&#xD;
      levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group;&#xD;
      and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of antipsychotic medication use&#xD;
      at 6 months compared to control. Secondary outcomes are: caregiver depression and caregiver&#xD;
      self-efficacy. The investigators propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 per arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training&#xD;
      program with remote support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure&#xD;
      changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after caregiver training. Kaiser Permanente is&#xD;
      an ideal setting because investigators have access to the complete electronic health record&#xD;
      (EHR), prescription medication use, health care use, and demographic data. The investigators&#xD;
      will be able to identify and enroll participants in real-time using an automated data &quot;troll&quot;&#xD;
      as investigators have done previously. This study will be an important step in expanding&#xD;
      access to training and support in a format that could be implemented within integrated&#xD;
      delivery systems with capitated payments (i.e., Accountable Care Organizations). Growing use&#xD;
      of EHR portals in these organizations will further increase demand for web-based care&#xD;
      management/support. Demand will also increase as today's near-retirees, familiar with&#xD;
      web-based applications, develop ADRD. Kaiser Permanente has pioneered such efforts and is the&#xD;
      lead site in the Mental Health Research Network (MHRN). Findings from this study will inform&#xD;
      a future multi-site pragmatic trial across the 13 health systems and 12 million enrollees in&#xD;
      the MHRN.&#xD;

Participants will be 100 Person-with-Dementia-Caregiver dyads in which the person with dementia lives at home and recently filled a new prescription for antipsychotic medication. The experimental intervention will combine three elements:&#xD;
self-directed learning in which the caregiver will receive training materials delivered electronically through a web-based learning portal;&#xD;
one orientation phone visit with a coach;&#xD;
ongoing support from the coach via telephone and secure messaging in the web-portal.&#xD;
Participants will complete self-report assessments at baseline, 8-weeks post-enrollment, and 6 months post-enrollment. Automated medication and primary care utilization data will be collected throughout the 6 month study period.</description>

    <description>One 60 minute baseline orientation phone visit with a coach to get verbal consent for participation in the study. Controls will receive usual care from their primary care provider and/or psychiatrist. We will give participants an information package from the Alzheimer's Association including a list of resources. To assist with retention, and to measure responses to secure messages, we will send a template secure message to control dyads once per month in which we remind participants to contact their primary care provider if they have any issues with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Dyads in the attention control may receive information and training from their primary care provider and the Alzheimer's Association. This &quot;attention control&quot; is proposed to assess the additional impact of STAR-VTF above treatment as usual. Investigators do not intend to track non-study training receipt in the control arm.</description>
