Cogstate is a brief, computerized, neuropsychological battery to evaluate cognitive impairments in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). CogState assesses attention and memory functions - including Information processing speed, Visual attention, Working memory and Visual learning. Cogstate scores are measured on a linear scale (with no maximum score). A reduction in scores compared to baseline signifies an improvement in cognitive functions.&#xD;
The Cogstate battery will be administered at Screening and each week for 12 weeks.&#xD;

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by a chronic brain glucose deficit. White matter glucose deterioration is also evident in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and specific to limbic fascicles. We will quantify the change in regional brain glucose uptake for gray matter and white matter tracts using PET imaging and the F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) radiotracer. PET maps will be registered to Magnetic Resonance (MR) anatomical images and corrected for partial volume effect. Standard uptake value ratios (SUVr) will be calculated using the cerebellum as a reference region.&#xD;
FDG-PET scans will be performed at Screening and Week 12.&#xD;

    <description>Change from Screening to Week 12 in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Mild Cognitive Impairment Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-MCI ADL)&#xD;
The 23-item ADCS-MCI-ADL Scale has good test-retest reliability, will be utilized to assess performance functioning in MCI patients (Galasko et al., 1997; Douglas Galasko et al., 2006; Pedrosa et al., 2010). The ADCS-ADL includes 18 items from traditional basic ADL scales and 5 items from instrumental activities of daily living scales (IADL) The possible range of total scores for the ADL Scale is 0-53 and higher scores indicate better functioning. The internal reliability was .91( Galasko et al., 1997; Douglas Galasko et al., 2006; Pedrosa et al., 2010).&#xD;
The ADCS-MCI ADL will be performed at Screening and Week 12.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Screening to Week 12 in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB)&#xD;
The CDR scale is a clinician-rated dementia staging system that tracks the progression of cognitive impairment in 6 categories (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care). Each category is scored on a 5-point scale in which None = 0, Questionable = 0.5, Mild = 1, Moderate = 2, and Severe = 3. The global CDR score is established by clinical scoring rules and has values of 0 (no dementia), 0.5, (questionable dementia), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), and 3 (severe dementia). The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) is obtained by adding the ratings in each of the 6 categories and ranges from 0 to 18 with higher scores indicative of greater impairment.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Goal Attainment Scale (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Goal Attainment Scale (GAS)&#xD;
The achievement of each goal is rated on a 5-point attainment scale (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2) to allow standardized scoring of personalized outcomes. A participant's overall goal attainment is quantified using a formula that takes into account the number of goals that have been set, and the extent to which they are correlated with each other. For each identified goal area, the caregiver will be asked to give a detailed description of the patient's current (baseline) status and goal status, which will be recorded at the -1 and 0 levels on the 5-point scale, respectively. The remaining levels of the scale will then be set: somewhat better than the goal (+1), much better than the goal (+2), and much worse than the goal (-2).&#xD;

    <description>Change from Screening to Week 12 in activity metrics (time spent lying, sitting, standing, stepping, upright, in walking bouts, in context specific walking bouts; number of steps, and sit-to-stand transitions) as measured by the activPAL monitor. Physical activity will be measured in real time using the activPal accelerometer worn on the patient's thigh. Total activity counts per minute (higher activity counts = more activity) and number of steps taken will be derived from data. Types of activity (e.g., sitting versus standing) are determined through activPAL's proprietary algorithms. Patients will be equipped with the activPAL and activity metrics will be measured prior to each EMACC assessment. Data will be measured at Screening, Week 1, Week 3, Week 6, Week 9 and Week 12.&#xD;

    <description>The Multidimensional Psychological Questionnaire (MPsQ) questionnaires have been designed to specifically measure patient personality characteristics associated with the placebo response. The MPsQ questionnaires are self-reported, and each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).&#xD;
MPsQs will be completed by the patient and separate MPsQs will be completed by the study partner at screening.&#xD;
MPsQs will be completed by the patient and separate MPsQs will be completed by the study partner prior to investigational product administration.&#xD;
