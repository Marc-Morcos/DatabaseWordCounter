  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among elderly patients. By its&#xD;
      prevalence and its medical and social consequences, AD represents a dual challenge to public&#xD;
      health and society. The elderly want to stay in their homes even when their lives are altered&#xD;
      by a chronic progressive disease. Their caregivers claim in turn a support at home. But this&#xD;
      desire is questioned because of the characteristics of the disease, e.g. the altered&#xD;
      relational function by the cognitive impairment and the behavioural disorders associated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatients non-drug therapies represent a potential support that adapts to patient with an&#xD;
      AD or mixed dementia, especially in their milder forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a weekly rehabilitation's intervention&#xD;
      at home and its acceptability by both the patient and the caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of its efficiency in terms of autonomy will be the next step.&#xD;

      The protocol is based on weekly rehabilitation's intervention at home. All home visits and&#xD;
      assessments of the patient and his caregiver will be made by the rehabilitation's therapist&#xD;
      himself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve weekly interventions at home are planed. The first five are needed to define a&#xD;
      realistic and achievable goal of treatment which is accepted by the dyad and the therapist.&#xD;
      The following seven interventions will achieve this goal by rehabilitation's intervention&#xD;
      (e.g. occupational therapy, psychomotor approach).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four filmed sessions for dyad's assessment are planned (at inclusion, at weeks 5 and 12 after&#xD;
      inclusion and 3 months after the last intervention).&#xD;
