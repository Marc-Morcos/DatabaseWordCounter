  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multiple dose, parallel group study will assess the monoamine oxidase in the&#xD;
      brain by in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) and safety of RO4602522 in patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer disease and in healthy volunteers. Patients and volunteers will receive multiple&#xD;
      doses of RO4602522 and up to three injections of C11-L-deprenyl-D2 used in the PET.&#xD;
