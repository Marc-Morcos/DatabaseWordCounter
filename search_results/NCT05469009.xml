  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of administering standard&#xD;
      of care monthly Aduhelm (Aducanumab) infusion therapy in combination with opening the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier with the Exablate Model 4000 Type 2 device in patients with mild&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of BBBO&#xD;
      (blood-brain barrier opening) using the Exablate Model 4000 Type 2 in the setting of standard&#xD;
      aducanumab therapy among patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD) with confirmed β-amyloid, who are eligible for aducanumab infusion therapy, and&#xD;
      to also evaluate the safety of the BBO procedure through patient examination (neurological&#xD;
      and cognitive/behavioral) and MRI assessments during the treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study is to determine the effect of BBBO in patients with&#xD;
      MCI or mild AD treated with aducanumab on brain β-amyloid plaque measured by amyloid positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET), as well as to assess the clinical impact of BBBO with standard&#xD;
      aducanumab therapy, if any, as assessed with ADAS Cog 11 and MMSE over time following BBBO.&#xD;
