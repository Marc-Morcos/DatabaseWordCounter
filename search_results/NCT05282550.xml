  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of trazodone on sleep, hippocampal-dependent memory and hippocampal&#xD;
      excitability. The investigators hypothesize that trazodone will improve total sleep time and&#xD;
      proportion of time in Slow Wave Sleep (SWS).&#xD;

      The REST trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study of trazodone&#xD;
      (50 mg at bedtime) in participants with Amnestic Mild Cognitive impairment (aMCI) and sleep&#xD;
      complaints. The investigators will randomize 100 subjects and administer trazodone and&#xD;
      placebo for 4 weeks each with a 4-week washout period in between. A 4-week washout period is&#xD;
      more than sufficient due to trazodone's elimination half-life of 10-12 hours. The crossover&#xD;
      design will facilitate recruitment and enable the use of the subjects as a control without&#xD;
      requiring a parallel placebo arm.&#xD;
