    <textblock>
      Background: Management of patients with Alzheimer's disease associated with behavioral&#xD;
      disturbances is difficult especially in those with agitation/aggression and insomnia and&#xD;
      nighttime behaviors. No treatment has shown any efficacy to control these disturbances and&#xD;
      psychotropics drugs, i.e. sedatives and hypnotics have numerous adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Assess the effect of bright light therapy on behavioral disturbances of patients&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's disease, especially the effect on agitation/aggression and insomnia and&#xD;
      nighttime behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Multicenter non pharmacological intervention trial, controlled, randomized,&#xD;
      open, two-arm design : control group and intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centres : Rehabilitation and long term-care units of 4 geriatric hospital wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: 120 patients admitted in geriatric hospital wards (30 by centre), with probable&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease according to DSM-IV diagnosis criteria and agitation/aggression&#xD;
      (associated or not with insomnia or nighttime behaviors) according to the Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      inventory, nurse scale (NPI-nurse).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments: Intervention group: patients will participate in a program of bright light&#xD;
      therapy realised during a one-hour sessions of occupational therapy,. These sessions will be&#xD;
      realised for groups of 6 patients and will be done every week day, at late morning, for 4&#xD;
      consecutive weeks). During the session, patients will be exposed to 10000 lux-bright light.&#xD;
      Patients of control group will participate in a program of occupational therapy of same&#xD;
      duration and rhythm, realised in standard light conditions (about 300 lux).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Patients with be assessed on 3 occasions: inclusion, two and four weeks after the&#xD;
      beginning of the programs. Assessment will comprise ; NPI-nurse scale and Cohen-Mansfield&#xD;
      scale for behaviour disturbances, wrist actimetry for sleep and nighttime behaviours (total&#xD;
      sleep length, nocturnal wake episodes and nocturnal motor agitation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Judgment criteria: Principal: changes in the agitation/aggression item of NPI-nurse scale.&#xD;
      Secondary: changes of the nightime behaviours item of NPI-nurse scale, the Cohen-Mansfield,&#xD;
      total sleep duration and numbers of nocturnal wake episodes measured by wrist actimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: Changes in agitation/aggression scores od the two groups will be compared by Mann&#xD;
      and Whitney test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and perspectives; If bright light exposure is efficient, professional&#xD;
      caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients might apply this cheap and non pharmacological&#xD;
      approach to improve behaviour and sleep of these patients. This study might contribute to&#xD;
      better define the place of a non invasive and promising technique, wrist actigraphy, to&#xD;
      assess sleep and behaviour disturbances in psychogeriatric patients&#xD;

      Our hypothesis is that bright light can help improve behavior and sleep in patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease with agitation type of behavior disorders. This hypothesis has been built&#xD;
      on the notion that morning exposure to bright light can reduce the synchronization of&#xD;
      circadian rhythms observed in patients with this disease, and the preliminary study data on&#xD;
      low numbers and supporting this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Primary objectives: To study the effect of treatment with bright light to improve&#xD;
      patient behavior disorders Alzheimer's disease, including its effect on agitation /&#xD;
      aggression (score obtained in item agitation / aggression of NPI scale-nurse).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: (1) To study the effect of treatment with bright light to improve&#xD;
      patient behavior disorders Alzheimer's disease, including its effect on sleep disorders&#xD;
      (score obtained in item nocturnal sleep-behavior NPI -nurse, scale score of Cohen-Mansfield)&#xD;
      ; (2) To study the effect of treatment with bright light treatment on cognitive function in&#xD;
      patients with Alzheimer's disease (MMSE score of the scale). (3)To examine the interest of&#xD;
      the wrist actigraphy to assess motor behavior and sleep in Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN The primary endpoint is the change over time of the score obtained in item&#xD;
      agitation / aggression of the NPI-nurse level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change over time the score for item-night sleep behavior NPI-nurse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change over time in the Cohen-Mansfield scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evolution over time of total sleep time determined by wrist actigraphy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes over time in the number of episodes of nocturnal restlessness determined by&#xD;
           wrist actigraphy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of data from the wrist actigraphy in the group without interference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change over time the scale score MMSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Non-pharmacological intervention, randomized, open, multicenter, parallel group&#xD;
      (intervention group and control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the research is 24 months. The study will be conducted among hospital&#xD;
      geriatric participants. Each center will equip a room to make light therapy: installing a&#xD;
      ceiling, provision of furniture to complete the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation of the subjects included in the search includes a visit inclusion and 5&#xD;
      visits spaced one week to assess the behavior, sleep and vis-à-vis tolerance of exposure to&#xD;
      bright light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables recorded: Some variables concerning the inclusion criteria and description of&#xD;
      patients and will be measured at baseline demographics, Alzheimer criteria NINCDS ADRDA,&#xD;
      severity of dementia, scale Observation-based nocturnal Sleep Inventory (ONSI) Negative to&#xD;
      screen for sleep apnea, MMSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of behavioral disorders by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-nurse) and the&#xD;
      Cohen-Mansfield scale will be performed before the initiation of treatment (end of S0) at the&#xD;
      end of S2 and at the end of S4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep duration and amplitude of motor activity will be assessed by wrist actigraphy. Tthe&#xD;
      wrist actigraphy has experienced a significant development for the assessment of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periods of wakefulness / sleep, will be studied using an actimeter the Vivago device (STI&#xD;
      International) which is in the form of a wristwatch worn on the wrist of the non-dominant&#xD;
      person and contains an accelerometer. The activity meter measures and records the full range&#xD;
      of motion achieved for 60 consecutive seconds and transmits the measured value every minute&#xD;
      radio frequency to a base connected to a computer that records real-time values. A computer&#xD;
      application to detect with good reliability sleep periods based on the analysis of movements&#xD;
      and their amplitude and has been validated by laboratory studies in healthy people of all&#xD;
      ages. This same device was also used to study the circadian rhythms in patients with dementia&#xD;
      and non-dementia in nursing homes, so it seems quite usable in demented patients. This system&#xD;
      collects the total sleep time, and periods of revival / night activity. For cons, the use of&#xD;
      this device to record and quantify motor agitation is a new approach that has never been&#xD;
      developed known. This exploratory approach will require several experimental treatments of&#xD;
      data to identify the most relevant parameters in the context of the analysis of the range of&#xD;
      motion. Schematically, the study will focus on the amplitude schedule of movements, but also&#xD;
      on the frequency of movement exceeding a certain threshold amplitude. Finally, the variation&#xD;
      in the test more than inter-individual differences will be studied in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment compliance by bright light will be assessed by the presence of the occupational&#xD;
      therapy sessions and the actual duration of patient's presence during exposure to bright&#xD;
      light recorded at each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not require laboratory test or imaging study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be centralized and organized by the Pitie-Salpetriere URC-Charles Foix.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by center. For each center, each patient is assigned a&#xD;
      randomization number by randoweb® and therefore a treatment, when it will be considered&#xD;
      eligible in the study. The randomization will be balanced by blocks within each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description of how to use the device Intervention group In the intervention group,&#xD;
      will be organized a occupational therapy sessions program group of 6 during which the bright&#xD;
      light will be administered. These sessions will take place 5 times a week for 4 consecutive&#xD;
      weeks. They will be organized in the late morning (10h30 - 12h) for a duration of 1:30, and&#xD;
      led by a teacher specially recruited for the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session lasts 1h30 and will be conducted in a room prepared for this purpose. It will&#xD;
      include three ceiling light therapy Elecolight® QUEBEC (including 10,000 lux lamps) placed&#xD;
      above the center of a rectangular table with 6 seats, about 50/60 cm (central device) or 80&#xD;
      cm (on both side of the central device) above the table plane. So patients sat around the&#xD;
      table to make occupational therapy activities while receiving bright light. The arrangement&#xD;
      will ensure that the lamp will be at a distance of 60-80 cm from the face of patients. The&#xD;
      light output power in areas where patients will sit will be measured with a light meter to&#xD;
      check the adequacy of the provision. This arrangement will allow patients to receive the&#xD;
      illumination in &quot;green&quot; requirements while achieving a group activity. The occupational&#xD;
      therapy activities will be chosen to be performed on the table: drawing, dominos, cards, etc&#xD;
      ... Given the particularities of the patients studied (patients with Alzheimer's disease with&#xD;
      behavioral problems), this mode of administration seems preferable to the conventional method&#xD;
      (patient to sit still in front of the light box), which would likely be encumbered with a&#xD;
      high failure rate with these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group Patients in the control group will benefit from occupational therapy sessions&#xD;
      program in same group as those in the intervention group, except the lighting conditions to&#xD;
      be normal conditions, that is to say an intensity of about 50 lux. They will be conducted by&#xD;
      specially recruited for the project educator in a comparable local, early afternoon and&#xD;
      during the same weeks as the intervention group. Indeed, the control group's program will&#xD;
      begin at the same time as the intervention group. The nature of occupational therapy sessions&#xD;
      offered to patients in this group are similar to those made during the sessions in the&#xD;
      intervention group. This point seems important because it allows a certain degree of&#xD;
      adjustment of the environment between the intervention and control, while minimizing the&#xD;
      management of differences, patients do not benefit all group sessions in usual care .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected duration of participation of people, and description of the timing and duration of&#xD;
      all periods of research The duration of a patient's participation in the research will be 5&#xD;
      weeks: S0, S1, S2, S3 and S4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tours are designated as follows: V0: evaluation at the end of the first week without&#xD;
      treatment (S0); V1: at the end of the first week of treatment (Week 1); V2, V3, V4, at the&#xD;
      end of the corresponding weeks of treatment (Week 2 to Week 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be 6 visits. Their timing and contents are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of screening include seeking eligibility criteria and patient information and&#xD;
      relatives by presenting the information note.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit Vi is the inclusion visit: obtaining the consent; The doctor will sign the&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other 5 visits are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V0: Initial evaluation with behavior assessment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then 4 visits (V1 to V4) weekly during treatment (performed at the end of each treatment&#xD;
           week): V1, V2, V3, V4: search for adverse events; V2, V4: behavioral assessment by a&#xD;
           psychologist; V4: collection of end of study information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The behavioral assessment by a psychologist will be made initially (V0) and then at V2 and V4&#xD;
      visits (VF or when stopping before the end of the study), employing specific rating scales&#xD;
      including NPI -nurse and scale Cohen-Mansfield, who are not practiced in the context of the&#xD;
      assumption usual care. The patient's cognitive functions controlled while checking the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, will also be re-evaluated using the MMSE scale during this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctor will perform recruited on a first time screening of patients, with an assessment&#xD;
      of their behavior disorders and sleep, within the framework defined by the criteria of&#xD;
      inclusion and non-inclusion of the study.&#xD;
