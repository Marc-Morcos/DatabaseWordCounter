    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess feasibility, acceptability, and safety of providing&#xD;
      tDCS to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) patients with apathy and to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of tDCS for ADRD-related symptoms, with a primary focus on apathy.&#xD;

    <description>Anode and cathode electrodes will be placed over the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortexes, respectively, with the use of the Omni-Lateral-Electrode system. Caregivers will set up and administer tDCS for participants with ADRD at home. tDCS will be applied for 30 min at an intensity of 2mA, with 30 s ramping up and down. All sessions will be remotely supervised by trained research staff.</description>
