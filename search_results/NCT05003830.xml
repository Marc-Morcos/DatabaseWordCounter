  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment, and its diagnosis&#xD;
      requires a comprehensive analysis of the results of medical history, neuropsychological&#xD;
      evaluation, imaging and laboratory tests. Among them, it has been widely recognized that&#xD;
      amyloid PET imaging is used in the early diagnosis of AD, tau protein PET imaging is used in&#xD;
      the assessment of the progression of AD, and the glucose metabolism PET imaging is used in&#xD;
      the assessment of nerve damage. MRI can provide structure, blood perfusion, neural network&#xD;
      connection damage and other information through multi-sequence scans. With the help of the&#xD;
      PET/MR multi-modal imaging platform and multi-probe imaging technology, it can provide more&#xD;
      sensitive and accurate imaging information for early diagnosis and disease assessment of AD,&#xD;
      and provide a basis for clinical treatment decision-making.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is a common neurodegenerative disease. The incidence of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD) in people over 65 years old is close to 5%, which brings a heavy burden to&#xD;
      society. Relying only on medical history and neuropsychological evaluation, the early&#xD;
      diagnosis and differential diagnosis of AD are difficult, and further imaging and laboratory&#xD;
      tests are needed. This project will use PET/MRI, the most advanced imaging platform, to&#xD;
      design a prospective clinical research program, combined with multi-sequence MRI and&#xD;
      multi-probe PET imaging, to evaluate suspected or diagnosed AD patients. Through&#xD;
      multi-parameter analysis of the structure MRI, function MRI (3D ASL, BOLD, DTI), metabolism&#xD;
      PET (18F-FDG) , AÎ² (11C-PIB) and tau (18F-PM-PBB3) PET, combined with clinical information,&#xD;
      to evaluate the value of multi-modal imaging for early diagnosis and differential diagnosis&#xD;
      of AD, to assist the clinic in the adjustment of early intervention measures and treatment&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;

    <description>18F-FDG, 11C-PIB and 18F-PM-PBB3 injection are radiopharmaceuticals used for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. 18F-FDG dose is about 3.7-5.4 MBq/kg (0.1 -0.15 mCi/kg), and used in the assessment of brain glucose metabolism. 11C-PIB dose is about 5-10mCi, and used in the assessment of amyloid deposition. 18F-PM-PBB3 dose is about 5-10mCi, and used in the assessment of tau deposition. Use PET/MR equipment for simultaneous PET and MR collection.</description>
