  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine if the ReCODE treatment has a measurable impact on&#xD;
      the typical progression of neurocognitive decline observed in patients with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease (AD) and patients who are exhibiting Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). MCI is often a&#xD;
      precursor to an AD diagnosis. For this study, there will be no distinction made between&#xD;
      participants who have been diagnosed with AD and those who show signs of MCI.&#xD;
