  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been associated with an about 2-fold increase in risk of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients with AD have been reported to have reduced insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity. It may be hypothesized that, compared to insulin sensitive subjects otherwise&#xD;
      similar in general health and body habitus, insulin resistant subjects are more likely to&#xD;
      have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indicators of incipient AD pathology, abnormalities in CSF&#xD;
      peptides related to insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis, and possibly other metabolites&#xD;
      that are associated with a risk of AD. The objective of this study is to examine the relation&#xD;
      of insulin resistance and the concentrations of CSF biomarkers. The results of this study may&#xD;
      be useful in the detection of the subjects who are at risk for cognitive decline and AD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been associated with an approximately 2-fold increase in risk of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients with AD have been reported to have reduced insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, and to have insulin concentrations that are elevated in plasma and decreased in&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cognitively normal individuals with insulin resistance are thus of&#xD;
      interest in our effort to gain an understanding of the antecedents of this problem. It may be&#xD;
      hypothesized that, compared to insulin sensitive subjects otherwise similar in general health&#xD;
      and body habitus, insulin resistant subjects are more likely to have CSF indicators of&#xD;
      incipient Alzheimer pathology, abnormalities in CSF peptides related to insulin signaling and&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis, and possibly other metabolites that are associated with a risk of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to 1) assess the concentrations of biomarkers of Alzheimer pathology in&#xD;
      the CSF of cognitively normal men with and without insulin resistance, and 2) assess the&#xD;
      concentrations of other CSF biomarkers of potential relevance to insulin resistance and AD in&#xD;
      the CSF of cognitively normal men with and without insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects with eligibility will have had an oral glucose tolerance test performed within&#xD;
      the past 3 months that revealed a normal fasting blood level and normal glucose tolerance. In&#xD;
      addition, they will have had no history of significant cognitive disorders, no prior&#xD;
      diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and will not be receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic.&#xD;
      Eligibility for inclusion in the insulin-resistant group will be defined by scores on the&#xD;
      Matsuda Index; non-insulin resistant controls will have normal values on the Matsuda Index.&#xD;
      An effort will be made to ensure that both groups (i.e., those with insulin resistance and&#xD;
      those without insulin resistance) will be similar in age, weight, BMI, and Apo E4 genotype&#xD;
      (APOE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will be performed on a single visit. The subjects will undergo a Mini-Mental&#xD;
      Status Examination (MMSE) performed by a qualified examiner. In addition, a blood sample will&#xD;
      be obtained for measurements of basic blood chemistry (electrolytes, creatinine, glucose,&#xD;
      total protein, and albumin), hematology, thyroid function, metabolic function (e.g. fasting&#xD;
      plasma glucose and insulin levels) and for proteomic analysis. The APOE genotype will be&#xD;
      determined from the blood samples, if it has not been assessed earlier. A lumbar puncture&#xD;
      will be performed to obtain CSF samples that will be used to determine concentrations of&#xD;
      biomarkers of AD pathology and to find out new biomarkers that may reflect AD pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All materials will be used according to national ethical guidelines for Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice. Analyses of the CSF for levels of beta-Amyloid biomarkers, total tau and&#xD;
      phosphorylated tau will be done using a sandwich ELISA. Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      provided for each analyte, comparing the 2 groups of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will provide written informed consent. Blood and CSF samples will be&#xD;
      analysed also by collaborators in other European countries. Before analysis and sending data&#xD;
      and blood/CSF samples to partners of the project, all clinical information and sample&#xD;
      information will be made anonymous (coded data). Personal information, i.e., name and&#xD;
      personal identity number, is removed from data/samples, and separate codes are given to them&#xD;
      before delivering them to other partners for the purposes of the project. Methods for&#xD;
      database maintenance and data delivery will be used that have proved to be functional in&#xD;
      previous research projects. A formal description of the different data formats, access&#xD;
      routines and tools for basic processing will be created at the start of the project.&#xD;
