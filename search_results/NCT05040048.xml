      The AETIONOMY project will generate a refined taxonomy and testable mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      derived stratification of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the AETIONOMY clinical study is to test in real clinical samples the&#xD;
      validity of the hypothesized underlying pathogenic mechanisms of AD and PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although not fully understood, the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases results from&#xD;
      the complex interplay between several biological pathways such as neuronal excitotoxicity,&#xD;
      oxidative stress, protein miss-folding and aggregation, neuroinflammation, apoptosis etc. It&#xD;
      is thus likely that the maps generated by the AETIONOMY project will comprise several&#xD;
      distinct biological hypotheses and subgroups of patients defined by 1 or more of these&#xD;
      hypotheses. The Consortium has insufficient resources to validate all these hypotheses.&#xD;
      Although it is anticipated that the AETIONOMY Project will provide novelty in the&#xD;
      investigators' understanding of neurodegenerative diseases, it is expected that previously&#xD;
      known biological pathways will come out from the data mining approach, e.g. mitochondrial&#xD;
      pathway for PD or beta-amyloid aggregation for AD. AETIONOMY project will take advantage of&#xD;
      these previously known pathways that will be considered as internal controls. One or two&#xD;
      novel pathogenic pathways will be tested in parallel. Overall, this strategy will allow&#xD;
      validating two hypotheses for each neurodegenerative disease (AD and PD). As it cannot be&#xD;
      predicted what hypotheses will precisely rise from the data mining, the approach must be&#xD;
      adaptative. However, it is possible to anticipate which population, clinical data, brain&#xD;
      imaging procedure, and which biological samples will have to be applied for their validation.&#xD;
      The AETIONOMY clinical study thus aims at assembling a standardized clinical, brain imaging,&#xD;
      and biological collection from AD patients, PD patients and healthy controls to validate the&#xD;
      model proposed by the AETIONOMY project. The Consortium will identify potential pathogenic&#xD;
      pathways (established and novel) involved in AD and PD and will deliver surrogate markers&#xD;
      which serve as readouts of the involved pathways. The model will be considered validated if&#xD;
      the selected makers allow subject stratification in the AETIONOMY clinical study according to&#xD;
      what has been postulated in the model. Additional correlation between biomarker expression&#xD;
      and brain imaging will be performed when available. A transversal cohort will be recruited&#xD;
      from 4 sites in Europe (France, Germany, Spain, and Sweden), including AD and PD patients,&#xD;
      individuals at risk of AD and PD, and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 655 subjects will be recruited. Subjects will have a single study visit with&#xD;
      clinical assessments, biological sampling, brain imaging (AD group only). Standardized&#xD;
      procedures will be used for biological sampling as well as for brain image acquisition.&#xD;
