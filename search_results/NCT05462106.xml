             time in the past unless there is firm evidence that the subject received placebo only&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. Previous treatment with any investigational and/or marketed passive immunotherapy&#xD;
             against AD within 6 months before screening or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer,&#xD;

         21. Ongoing treatment with any approved anti-amyloid passive immunotherapy for Alzheimer's&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;

             antipsychotics; γ-aminobutyric acid agonists (eg, gabapentin); or stimulants (eg,&#xD;
             methylphenidate, modafinil). Stable doses of atypical antipsychotics or&#xD;
             benzodiazepines are only allowed if this is not considered to influence the safety and&#xD;
