  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence indicates that inflammation is prominent both in the blood and central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. These data suggest that systemic&#xD;
      inflammation plays a crucial role in the cause and effects of AD neuropathology. Capitalizing&#xD;
      on the experience from a previous clinical trial with thalidomide, here, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that modulating both systemic and CNS inflammation via the pleiotropic&#xD;
      immunomodulator lenalidomide is a putative therapeutic intervention for AD if administered at&#xD;
      a proper time window during the course of the disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no approved treatments to treat the neuroinflammatory aspects of AD.&#xD;
      While inflammation is pervasive to many neurological disorders, no clinical trial has yet&#xD;
      demonstrated the efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents for AD. Interestingly, chronic&#xD;
      peripheral low-grade inflammation is associated with aging and increases the risk for disease&#xD;
      and mortality, including AD. Accumulating evidence indicates that nuclear factor-kappa B,&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukins (e.g. IL-1beta, IL-2, and IL-6), and&#xD;
      chemokines (e.g. IL-8) are found elevated both in the blood and central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      of AD patients. These data confirm that inflammation plays a central role in the cause and&#xD;
      effect of AD neuropathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunomodulator, anti-cancer agent lenalidomide is one of the very few pleiotropic agents&#xD;
      that both lowers the expression of TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, and increases the expression of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-10), to modulate both innate and adaptive immune&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current project the investigators aim to test the central hypothesis that lenalidomide&#xD;
      reduces inflammatory and AD-associated pathological biomarkers, and improves cognition. For&#xD;
      this, the investigators designed an 18-month, Phase II, double-blind, randomized, two-armed,&#xD;
      parallel group, placebo controlled, and proof-of-mechanism clinical study in early&#xD;
      symptomatic AD subjects (i.e. amnestic mild cognitive impairment; aMCI). The effects of&#xD;
      lenalidomide treatment will be assessed after 12 months of treatment and 6 months washout&#xD;
      (month 18).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  In order to be eligible for this study, subjects must meet the following inclusion&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Male or female outpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. At least 50 years of age, but less than 90 (89 at time of screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Females must be surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, oophorectomy, or&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) or postmenopausal for 2 years (no women at risk of pregnancy will&#xD;
                  be accepted in this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Must have been diagnosed with amnestic MCI based on the most recent NIA-AA&#xD;
                  criteria (Albert et al., 2011), i.e. at both the screening and baseline visits&#xD;
                  (visits 1 and 2) have a documented Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score between&#xD;
                  22-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. CT or MRI scan of the brain obtained during the course of the dementia must be&#xD;
                  consistent with the diagnosis and show no evidence of significant focal lesions&#xD;
                  or of pathology which could contribute to dementia. If neither a CT nor an MRI&#xD;
                  scan is available from the past 12 months, a CT scan fulfilling the requirements&#xD;
                  must be obtained before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Vision and hearing must be sufficient to comply with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Be able to take oral medications.&#xD;

                  it is stable for at least 90 days before the Baseline (Week 00) and is expected&#xD;
                  to remain on a stable dose for the remainder of the study period; or have&#xD;
                  demonstrated intolerance to or lack of efficacy from these medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Must have a collateral informant/study partner who has significant direct contact&#xD;
                  with the patient at least 10 hours per week and who is willing to accompany the&#xD;
                  patient to all clinic visits and to be present during all telephone&#xD;
                  visits/interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. If the patient has a legally authorized representative (LAR), the LAR must review&#xD;
                  and sign the informed consent form. If the patient does not have an LAR, the&#xD;
                  patient must appear able to provide informed consent and must review and sign the&#xD;

                  defined above) must sign the informed consent form. If the LAR and the patient's&#xD;
                  informant /study partner is the same individual, he/she should sign under both&#xD;
                  designations.&#xD;

                  Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
              15. Medical records must document evidence of amnestic MCI with 1 of the following:&#xD;
