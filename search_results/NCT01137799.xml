    <textblock>
      This study in patients with stable schizophrenia will investigate the effect of JNJ-39393406&#xD;
      on Event Related Potentials (Auditory Evoked Potential [AEP] P50, AEP P300 and Mismatch&#xD;
      Negativity [MMN]) after single dose administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), four-way-crossover trial&#xD;
      (participants may receive different interventions sequentially during the trial) in patients&#xD;
      with stable schizophrenia. The four-way-crossover treatment phase will consist of four&#xD;
      blinded treatment periods separated by a wash out period (the period allowed for the entire&#xD;
      administered drug to be eliminated from the body) of 6 to 14 days. The study duration for&#xD;
      each patient will be approximately 12 weeks. Each patient enrolled will receive 3 (out of 5)&#xD;
      dose levels of JNJ-39393406 and one dose of placebo. Part A of the study will include smoking&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia and will precede part B which will include non-smoking patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia. Safety evaluations include adverse event monitoring, vital signs and&#xD;
      clinical laboratory tests. The study drug will be given as a single dose on Day 1 of each&#xD;
      treatment period as a kind of liquid formulation with 240 mL non-carbonated water between&#xD;
      7:00 AM and 10:30 AM. Before dosing patients will be given a standard breakfast. The proposed&#xD;
      dose levels for this study (Part A and Part B) will range from 10 to 200 mg.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A known history of schizophrenia of at least 12 months by the referring psychiatrist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DSM-IV criteria for Schizophrenia (including all subtypes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable treatment for at least 3 months (minor changes are acceptable upon confirmation&#xD;
             by the sponsor representative)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs,&#xD;
             and 12-lead ECG performed at screening. If there are abnormalities, they must be&#xD;
             consistent with the underlying illness in the study population&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically stable on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If&#xD;
             the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the&#xD;
             normal reference ranges, the subject may be included only if the investigator judges&#xD;
             the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be&#xD;
             appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be&#xD;
             recorded in the subject source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI between 18 and 35 kg/m² inclusive (BMI = weight/height²)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the pharmacogenomic component of this study subjects must have signed a separate&#xD;
             written informed consent indicating willingness to participate in Part 1 genetic&#xD;
             testing (mandatory), and indicate either consent or refusal for Part 2 DNA storage.&#xD;
             Subject participation in the genetic testing component of the study (Part 1) is&#xD;
             mandatory. Participation in the DNA storage component (Part 2) is voluntary and&#xD;
             refusal to participate will not result in ineligibility for the main part of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A DSM-IV axis I diagnosis other than schizophrenia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for clinical chemistry, hematology or&#xD;
             urinalysis at screening or admission. It is expected that laboratory values will&#xD;
             generally be within the normal range for the laboratory, though minor deviations,&#xD;
             which are not considered to be of clinical significance to the investigator, are&#xD;
             acceptable. Values of ALT/AST &lt; 2 fold the upper limit of normal will be allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal physical examination, vital signs or 12 lead ECG at&#xD;
             screening. Minor deviations in ECG, which are not considered to be of clinical&#xD;
             significance to the investigator, are acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTcb &gt;470ms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A DSM-IV diagnosis of substance dependence within 6 months prior to screening&#xD;
             evaluation (caffeine dependence is not exclusionary. Patients with a positive drug&#xD;
             screen at screening may be included provided use does not lead to a DSM-IV diagnosis&#xD;
             of substance dependence and patients consents to abstain from illegal drugs within 3&#xD;
             days prior to Day -1 and at any time during the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment-resistant subjects (failure to respond to two different antipsychotic drugs&#xD;
             in the past)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PANSS scores &gt; 70&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suicidal risk (assessed by the investigator such as, prior attempts to suicide,&#xD;
             command hallucinations and / or hopelessness)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of clozapine within 3 months before screening until follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of more than two antipsychotic drugs within 3 months before dosing until follow up&#xD;
