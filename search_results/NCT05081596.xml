  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of Problem Adaptation Therapy for Pain&#xD;
      (PATH-Pain) on cognitive functioning, depression and pain-related disability in 100 older&#xD;
      adults with cognitive impairment, chronic pain, and depression. The study will test if&#xD;
      PATH-Pain has better cognitive, affective, and functional outcomes than Attention Control&#xD;
      Usual Care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Randomized Control Trial to target cognition in older adults with MCI or Early AD,&#xD;
      depression, and chronic pain with a psychotherapeutic intervention in primary care. This&#xD;
      project will study the efficacy of 8 in-office acute treatment sessions (first 8 weeks) and 6&#xD;
      telephone delivered sessions (3 individual and 3 group) in the following months (from 9-36&#xD;
      weeks) of PATH- Pain vs. an equal number of sessions consisting of Attention Control Usual&#xD;
      Care in improving cognitive, affective, and functional outcomes. Each therapy session will&#xD;
      last approximately 50 minutes. Assessments will be conducted at study entry and weeks 5, 9&#xD;
      (end of acute treatment; includes assessment of cognitive functioning), 24, 36 (end of&#xD;
      follow-up treatment; includes assessment of cognitive functioning) and 52 (includes&#xD;
      assessments of cognitive functioning) after randomization. This is an efficacy trial, but by&#xD;
      being delivered by certified mental health clinicians, it has a strong &quot;real-world&quot; focus.&#xD;

    <description>Problem Adaptation Therapy-PAIN (PATH-PAIN) is an emotion regulation intervention aimes to reduce stress and decrease depression and disability.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Attention Control Usual Care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Usual Care involves the continued medical attention and treatment provided by the subject's physician and other medical professionals in primary care. This may include medical intervention or referrals to specialists to address issues of depression, pain or memory difficulties. Subjects will also be asked to meet with a study research assistant for structured interviews and educational sessions consisting of general questions regarding health habits and other non-medical topics unrelated to cognitive impairment, pain, and depression. Additionally, subjects will receive an educational booklet on pain and depression.</description>

    <description>The goals of PATH-Pain are to: 1) Teach problem solving skills to reduce negative emotions, by using emotion regulation and problem- solving strategies to overcome these difficulties. 2) Use compensatory strategies and environmental adaptation tools (notes, checklists, calendars, etc.) to avoid limitations resulting from memory problems, help improve emotion regulation, and create an easier environment to live in. If found helpful and participant agrees, a tablet application called WellPATH will be used to help the subject with emotion regulation techniques. The tablet will be given at the beginning of treatment and will be returned at the end of treatment. 3) Invite caregiver participation, when appropriate.&#xD;
Subjects in the PATH-PAIN group will receive 8 weekly sessions (first 8 weeks) with a study therapist and 6 monthly phone sessions (3 individual and 3 group) for 9-36 weeks. Each session will last approximately 50 minutes.</description>
