  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will randomly be placed into one of four groups and experience one of the four&#xD;
      following conditions: (1) a placebo light that provides a 40 hertz (Hz) flicker (rhythmic&#xD;
      light [RL]); (2) a placebo light with a random flicker (placebo condition for rhythmic&#xD;
      light); (3) a light source that will stimulate the circadian system and provides a 40 Hz&#xD;
      flicker (RL); or (4) a light source that will stimulate the circadian system and provides a&#xD;
      random flicker (placebo condition for rhythmic light). Following a baseline week,&#xD;
      participants will experience his/her assigned lighting condition for two hours in the morning&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. After a 4-week washout period, a final round of assessments will be obtained.&#xD;
      Study assessments (except for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment) will be collected at the end of each week, for a total of 8 assessments.&#xD;

      The tailored lighting intervention used to promote circadian entrainment will provide high&#xD;
      circadian stimulation during the day produced by narrowband blue light peaking at 470&#xD;
      nanometers (nm). A comparison lighting intervention (i.e., placebo lighting), a narrowband&#xD;
      red light peaking at 630 nm, will be used as a control. Both the red and the blue light&#xD;
      devices will also provide either the 40 hertz (Hz) flicker (RL) or the random flicker&#xD;
      (placebo RL). For the random flicker (placebo RL), the duty cycle will be delivered with a&#xD;
      random interval determined by a Poisson process with an average interval of 40 hertz (Hz).&#xD;

    <description>Participants view a serial visual display of letters and math problems. They are asked to hold the letters in memory while simultaneously determining if the simple math problems are correct (e.g., 7+5=13). Math performance is measured in percent correct and verbal performance is assessed by calculating Accuracy and Reaction Time (RT).</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a tool that can be used to measure sleep quality in clinical populations, composed of 19 items that generate 7 component scores (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction). Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, with higher score indicates worse sleep quality</description>

    <description>The Dementia Quality of Life Instrument (DQoL) measures self-esteem, positive affect/humor, negative affect, feelings of belonging, and sense of aesthetics.The DQoL consists of 29 items, grouped into 5 subscales according to domain. Subjects are instructed to answer using a 5-point response scale (score from 1-5), either verbally or through use of a visual scale. Scores for each subscale are Self-esteem (4-20), Positive Affect/Humor (6-30), Absence of Negative Affect (11-55), Feelings of Belonging (3-15), Sense of Aesthetics (5-25); however, subscale scores are not summed for a total score. A higher number indicates greater quality of life.</description>
