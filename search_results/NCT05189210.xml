  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is being conducted by the Sponsor to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      GV1001 (0.56 mg and 1.12 mg) administered subcutaneously as a treatment for mild to moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies using in vivo and in vitro AD models have shown that GV1001&#xD;
      inhibits neurotoxicity, apoptosis, and the production of reactive oxygen species induced by&#xD;
      amyloid beta (Aβ) in neural stem cells by mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human&#xD;
      telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). In nonclinical studies, using both mild (early&#xD;
      stage) and severe (late stage) AD mouse models, GV1001 was shown to improve cognitive&#xD;
      function and memory, as well as significantly reduce the amount of Aβ and tau proteins. The&#xD;
      multifunctional effect of GV1001 makes it a promising therapeutic option for the treatment&#xD;
      for AD. In a completed Phase 2 study conducted in Korea, GV1001 showed significant&#xD;
      improvement in change from baseline of Severe Impairment Battery score at Week 24 and&#xD;
      demonstrated a clinically acceptable safety profile in patients with moderate to severe AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2&#xD;
      study in participants with mild to moderate AD. The study will consist of a screening visit&#xD;
      (up to 60 days prior to first dose), a 52-week double-blind treatment period, and an&#xD;
      end-of-study (EOS) visit 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive GV1001 0.56 mg, GV1001 1.12 mg, or placebo&#xD;
      (normal saline) every week for 4 weeks beginning on Day 1 (of Week 1) followed by every 2&#xD;
      weeks through Week 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization, eligibility of potential participants will be confirmed through an&#xD;
      adjudication process in which screening data (eg, MMSE, magnetic resonance imaging/computed&#xD;
      tomography [MRI/CT] scans) obtained to evaluate AD status are reviewed by a central&#xD;
      independent adjudicator. The central independent adjudicator will review the scoring sheet&#xD;
      completed by the Investigator prior to randomization and provide an independent assessment of&#xD;
      the participant's eligibility and may request exclusion of a participant from entry into the&#xD;
      study. A central independent reader will review MRI and/or CT scans to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
      Investigators must not randomize a participant prior to receipt of this independent&#xD;
      confirmation of the participant's eligibility. Results from Aβ positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) scan or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination performed within the 2 years prior to&#xD;
      screening will also be used to confirm eligibility. If no Aβ PET scan or CSF examination&#xD;
      results are available, participants will undergo an Aβ PET scan at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant discontinues treatment prematurely, the participant will be asked to&#xD;
      continue with the scheduled study visits until the EOS visit. If a participant discontinues&#xD;
      the study prematurely (except for those who withdraw their consent), the participant will be&#xD;
      asked to come for an early termination (ET) visit for efficacy scale and safety assessments.&#xD;
      These assessments are the same as those scheduled at the primary endpoint (PE) visit at Week&#xD;
      52. If the ET visit takes place within 4 weeks after a completed protocol scheduled visit&#xD;
      with efficacy assessments, efficacy scale assessments are not required at the ET visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For an individual participant, the maximum duration of study participation is approximately&#xD;
      14.5 months, including an up to 60-day screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review to evaluate safety data will be&#xD;
      performed when at least 90 participants (50%) have either completed Week 26 or have&#xD;
      discontinued the study. The DSMB may recommend early stopping of the study for safety&#xD;
      reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluations will be performed at baseline, Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52&#xD;
      using the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale [ADAS-cog11]),&#xD;
      assessment of activities of daily living (ie, Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily&#xD;
      Living Questionnaire [A-IADL-Q]), and global ratings of dementia (ie, Clinical Dementia&#xD;
      Rating-Sum of Boxes [CDR-SB], Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI], Mini-Mental State Examination&#xD;
      [MMSE], Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change - Plus Family Input [CIBIC-Plus],&#xD;
      and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease [QoL-AD]). The ADAS-cog11 scale will be evaluated&#xD;
      by a central independent reader for each visit. At the visits where several efficacy&#xD;
      assessments are administered, every effort should be made to perform the efficacy evaluations&#xD;
      in the same order at each visit (ADAS-cog11, A-IADL-Q, CDR-SB, NPI, MMSE, CIBIC-Plus, and&#xD;
      QoL-AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring for AEs, laboratory evaluations,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and vital signs measurements. Suicidal ideation and&#xD;
      behavior will be assessed using the C-SSRS. Blood and CSF samples will be collected to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of GV1001 on analysis of biomarkers of AD. Blood&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) consists of 2 parts, a cognitive subscale and a behavioral subscale. The 11-item cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) of the ADAS instrument will be used in this study. The ADAS-cog11 is a widely accepted performance-based assessment of cognition used in clinical studies for the treatment of participants with AD.&#xD;
The ADAS-cog11 (score range) consists of word recall (0-10) and word recognition memory tests (0-12), object and finger naming (0-5), commands (0-5), constructional praxis (0-5), ideational praxis (0-5), orientation (0-8), remembering test instructions (0-5), spoken language ability (0-5), comprehension of spoken language (0-5) and word finding difficulty (0-5). The maximum possible total score is 70, with a higher ADAS-cog11 score indicating worse cognitive function.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in A-IADL-Q score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of cognitively complex &quot;instrumental activities of daily living&quot; (IADLs), such as managing personal finances, using mobile phones, or even doing grocery shopping, is related to quality of life, caregiver burden, and resource utilization and is a relevant area to assess in AD clinical trials. There are various well validated IADL scales, but some are outdated as they do not assess current daily tasks.&#xD;
The Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q) is an adaptive and computerized questionnaire designed to assess impairments IADL in patients with cognitive decline due to mild dementia. The questionnaire is completed by a caregiver and consists of 70 items in 7 categories (time needed 20-25 minutes).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in CDR-SB score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a 5-point global rating scale used to characterize 6 domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to AD and related dementias: memory, orientation, judgment &amp; problem solving, community affairs, home &amp; hobbies, and personal care. The information needed to make each rating is obtained through a semi-structured interview of the participant and a reliable informant or collateral source (eg, family member). The CDR rater should be trained to administer the semi-structured interview and should be blinded to results of other assessments.&#xD;
For each domain, a rating is assigned to quantify the severity of impairment/dementia (0=no impairment; 0.5=very mild impairment; 1=mild impairment; 2=moderate impairment; and 3=severe impairment). The sum of the ratings for the 6 domains is the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in NPI score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI is a validated informant-based interview that assesses behavioral symptoms of dementia. It covers 12 domains.&#xD;
The NPI is administered to the participant's caregiver and includes an integrated caregiver distress measure. For each domain, abnormal behavior is noted to be absent (score=0) or present. If present, the frequency (rarely=1, sometimes=2, often=3, and very often=4), severity (mild=1, moderate=2, and severe=3), and associated caregiver distress (0=not at all, 1=minimally, 2=mildly, 3=moderately, 4=severely, and 5=very severely or extremely) are to be rated.&#xD;
The product of frequency and severity (maxi.=12) is calculated for each domain. A total NPI was the sum of the frequency and severity products (maxi. =144). A higher NPI score indicates a greater degree of behavioral disturbances.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in MMSE score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a brief test of cognitive function, defined as the sum of 11 items: orientation in time and place, registration, attention and concentration, recall, naming 2 objects, repetition, 3-stage command, reading, writing and copying. Scores range from 0 to 30; higher scores indicate better cognitive function.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in CIBIC-Plus score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The CIBIC-Plus is used as a measure of global clinical status. It is an independent, semi-structured medical interview that is used to assess changes in the participant's condition during a clinical study. An independent, experienced, and properly trained rater will provide a global impression of the participant's condition based on separate interviews with the participant and caregiver.&#xD;
The rater is not to elicit caregiver's opinion of the participant's condition but only factual information about the study participant's functioning.&#xD;
The change from baseline in CIBIC-Plus is rated on a 7-point scale: 1=markedly improved, 2=moderately improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=moderately worse, and 7=markedly worse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in QoL-AD score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The QoL-AD includes the participant's and caregiver's appraisal of the participant's physical condition, mood, interpersonal relationships, ability to participate in meaningful activities, financial situation, and an overall assessment of self as a whole and life quality as a whole. It seems to be reliable and valid for individuals with MMSE scores greater than 10. The measure has 13 items, rated on a 4-point scale (poor, fair, good, excellent), with &quot;l&quot; being poor and &quot;4&quot; being excellent. Total scores range from 13 to 52. Separate scores are calculated for participant and caregiver reports.</description>
