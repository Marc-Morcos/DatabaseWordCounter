  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Alzheimer's and Blood Glucose Levels Study is researching the differences in blood&#xD;
      glucose levels between people with and without Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease with the aim of early detection of Alzheimer's Disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data from participants already using&#xD;
      CGMs to better understand the relationship between Alzheimer's Disease and blood glucose&#xD;
      levels. This study will use the &quot; Endobits Companion &quot; app for data collection. The Endobits&#xD;
      Companion app is freely available for Android and iOS mobile devices, and was designed to&#xD;
      keep track of patients diabetes management through a journal and relay this information with&#xD;
      their CGM readings to their caring physician.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will use continuous glucose monitors for the period of the study. The primary outcome is to determine the difference in mean values, variability, and other patterns in blood glucose levels between the case and control groups. As there is no intervention in this study, the difference between the case and control group will be measured over the entire study period.</description>
