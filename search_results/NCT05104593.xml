    <textblock>
      The CAREPATH will conduct Technical Validation and Usability (TVU) study by involving ≥ 45&#xD;
      target end users (16 patients with MCI or mild dementia with their informal caregivers and 16&#xD;
      healthcare professionals from various disciplines) and Clinical Investigation (CI) study&#xD;
      involving ≥ 200 patients (≥ 100 users to pilot the CAREPATH platform and ≥ 100 patients as&#xD;
      reference cases). Both of these pilot studies will be coordinated in four European countries&#xD;
      (Spain, Romania, Germany and UK) with diverse health and social care systems, ICT&#xD;
      landscape/digital maturity of healthcare provision and dementia national programs, which will&#xD;
      allow for strengthening the evidence base on health outcomes and efficiency gains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAREPATH outcomes can be summarized as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An Integrated Care Platform that jointly addresses multimorbidity, dementia and&#xD;
           diminished intrinsic capacity and optimally manages healthcare interventions for its&#xD;
           users (patients, informal caregiver, healthcare providers, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Technical Validation and Usability (TVU) study involving over 45 users and Clinical&#xD;
           Investigation (CI) involving over 200 patients that will be conducted in four European&#xD;
           countries (Spain, Romania, Germany and UK) during two years and mobilizing the other&#xD;
           necessary actors, such as caregivers and healthcare professionals, for the validation of&#xD;
           healthcare interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dementia / Multimorbidity Guidelines that will be conceived for best healthcare&#xD;
           delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Health Economics Impact Assessment for healthcare cost effectiveness and care provision&#xD;
           equalities. The incremental cost-effectiveness and the incremental cost-utility ratio&#xD;
           would allow revealing the incremental cost (or the potential savings) per unit of&#xD;
           benefit of switching from usual care to CAREPATH-an integrated patient-centred approach-&#xD;
           in multimorbid elderly patients with dementia, and therefore, to determinate whether the&#xD;
           CAREPATH approach would be considered as a cost-effective alternative.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Usability study In order to ensure that the CAREPATH system is well-usable by its main&#xD;
      target user groups namely patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or mild dementia,&#xD;
      their informal caregivers and health care professionals in charge of caring for this patient&#xD;
      group, a usability evaluation of the platform will be conducted as part of the Technical&#xD;
      Validation and Usability (TVU) study described in chapter 1.3.6 of the proposal (IEC TR&#xD;
      62366-2: 2016-04 Medical devices - Part 2: Guidance on the application of usability&#xD;
      engineering to medical devices). It will be carried out at the end of the main development&#xD;
      phase to investigate usability issues and its results will serve as input for the (re-)design&#xD;
      of the platform before the clinical investigation starts. Implementation of good usability of&#xD;
      a medical device such as the CAREPATH platform is also enforced by the usability engineering&#xD;
      process required now in the development of a medical devices by the new Medical Device&#xD;
      Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745) (Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European parliament&#xD;
      and of the council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC,&#xD;
      Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and repealing Council Directives&#xD;
      90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC) which originates in the concern that increasing complexity and&#xD;
      interactivity of medical devices bears a high risk of errors in handling if poorly designed&#xD;
      causing harm to patients. Therefore, usability and safety are seen as interrelated and in the&#xD;
      CAREPATH usability study possible hazardous situations will also be taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Clinical Investigation with a Medical Device class IIa After finishing the TVU, a Clinical&#xD;
      Investigation will be conducted in order to validate the technological system CAREPATH for&#xD;
      multimorbid elderly patients with MCI up to mild dementia (see Work Package 5 of the complete&#xD;
      proposal). This version of CAREPATH will include the modifications made by engineers in the&#xD;
      system after the analysis of the TVU phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective will be to analyze the reduction in healthcare appointments and the&#xD;
      hypothesis is that CAREPATH will improve Quality of Life (QoL) of these patients through a&#xD;
      multicomponent approach based on the 5 following principles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establishment of disease and treatment burden, by considering how a person's health&#xD;
           problems affect their day-to-day life, their mental health and their wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Formulation of patient goals, values and priorities&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Communicating to patients and caregivers the benefits, risks and costs of treatments and&#xD;
           medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Provision of an individualised care plan.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization will be performed centrally using a computerized system that uses stratified block randomization. After screening, patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (CAREPATH or control). Patients will be randomized in a CAREPATH to control ratio of 1:1. Randomization to intervention allocation will be stratified by sex, associated comorbidity and geographic region. Stratification factors will ensure balance of these factors across intervention arms and facilitate unbiased estimate of intervention effect in subgroups.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The study is to be conducted in a simple-blind manner to minimize potential bias from investigators. It is not possible to conduct a double-blind study, because patients will know if they are using CAREPATH or not. In each site, two different investigators will be involved in the study. The first one will be responsible of initial assessments, randomization and management during follow-up. The investigator responsible of follow-up assessments for outcomes will be blinded to the assignment group in order to reduce the treatment effect bias.</masking_description>

    <description>The intervention tested will be the CAREPATH system. CAREPATH consists of an integrated, patient-centred, flexible and modular system that will provide a viable solution for the improvement of the management of multimorbid elderly patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment or mild dementia, with the help of clinicians. CAREPATH will act on patients and their informal caregivers, and its main objective is to empower multimorbid patients with MCI or mild dementia to manage their health condition together with their informal caregiver by providing assistance and reinforcement to follow their individual care plans, so independence and quality of life will increase for both of them. The intervention will provide a personalized care plan and activities proposal (treatment, activities proposal, lifestyle changes, referrals etc.) to patients and caregivers, considering the various sources of patient data available through the CAREPATH platform, and with the help of clinicians.</description>
