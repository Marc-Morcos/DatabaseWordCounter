      This is an open-label study without randomisation. All eligible patients will receive two&#xD;
      administrations of the investigational imaging agent [18F]PI-2620 at a radioactive dose of&#xD;
      185 MBq, one with high specific activity (≤ 5 µg tracer mass dose), another one with low&#xD;
      specific activity (40-50 µg tracer mass dose).&#xD;

      This is an open-label, single center study to visually assess and quantitatively compare&#xD;
      brain PET images obtained after application of [18F]PI-2620 with different specific&#xD;
      activities: 1) High specific activity (low mass dose): 185 MBq containing a maximum mass dose&#xD;
      of ≤5 μg in up to 10 mL and 2) Low specific activity (high mass dose): 185 MBq containing a&#xD;
      maximum mass dose of 40-50 μg in up to 10 mL).&#xD;
