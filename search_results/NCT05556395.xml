    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of why some individuals who have&#xD;
      suffered a stroke experience post-stroke cognitive decline. Specifically this study is&#xD;
      testing whether global disruption of the blood-brain barrier detected at the time of the&#xD;
      stroke is informative about the risk of post-stroke cognitive decline over the next 3 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is well known that ischemic stroke is a risk factor for developing dementia. Prior studies&#xD;
      have shown that after a stroke, there can be a change in the trajectory of cognitive&#xD;
      performance with acceleration of decline. The mechanism of this phenomenon has not been&#xD;
      established. It is known that vascular changes in the brain, referred to as cerebral small&#xD;
      vessel disease, are associated with cognitive decline and dementia. Cerebral small vessel&#xD;
      disease is readily seen on MRI scans of the brain, and the larger the burden of these&#xD;
      findings, the higher the risk of cognitive deficits. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier&#xD;
      has been implicated in the development of the changes seen on MRI. Acute stroke has been&#xD;
      shown to disrupt the blood-brain barrier, even in parts of the brain not directly affect by&#xD;
      the stroke. The investigators hypothesize that when there is diffuse blood-brain barrier&#xD;
      disruption in response to an acute stroke it sets off a cascade of changes in the brain that&#xD;
      lead to post-stroke cognitive decline.&#xD;
