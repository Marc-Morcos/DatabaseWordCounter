  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer´s disease is a devastating illness that effects the patients as well as their&#xD;
      family members. Its prevalence increases exponentially and the burden on the healthcare&#xD;
      system is enormous. AD neuropathology begins 15-20 years before the occurrence of cognitive&#xD;
      symptoms, which ranges from preclinical stage to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia.&#xD;
      Prodromal AD is an early stage of the disease which is characterized by positive biomarkers&#xD;
      and MCI. To this day, there is no medication that can cure or halt the progression of the&#xD;
      disease and most studies focus on finding reversible risk factors and changing their&#xD;
      influence. Several aetiologies have been proposed, like the deposition of amyloid and tau&#xD;
      proteins, neuroinflammation and cerebral ischemia due to cerebrovascular factors. The Amyloid&#xD;
      deposition, which serves as the biological marker of AD, was originally thought to be the&#xD;
      main cause of the disease, however, recent data suggests that it is not the cause and that it&#xD;
      might actually has a protective role. On the other hand, it is known today that vascular&#xD;
      changes with related tissue ischemia and neuroinflammation have a crucial role in the&#xD;
      development of AD in many patients. These pathologies, ischemia &amp; neuroinflammation, can be&#xD;
      improved by the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). The goal of this study is to explore&#xD;
      the potential beneficial effect of HBOT on prodromal AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer disease is characterised by cognitive, mental and functional disability that is&#xD;
      expected to progress until the patient is fully dependent on others for activities of daily&#xD;
      living. The pathology begins many years until the cognitive symptoms appear. Prodromal&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease is a state where a person has mild cognitive impairment and Amyloid&#xD;
      deposition, which is seen on brain Amyloid PET or in lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there has been neither a cure nor a therapy that can significantly halt or relieve&#xD;
      symptoms for most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study offers a new biological therapeutic approach aimed to induce neuroplasticity and&#xD;
      improve neurological and cognitive functions. Pre -clinical as well as clinical data indicate&#xD;
      that HBOT can be beneficial for those patients who suffer from MCI due to Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      and also to patients with cerebral vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBOT is a well-known treatment used in clinical practice for other indications and is&#xD;
      considered to be safe with relative rare mild and reversible side effect .The study is&#xD;
      designed as a prospective, randomized, sham controlled double blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled up to a total of 100 subjects, age 60-85, diagnosed with MCI and&#xD;
      positive Amyloid PET and vascular changes on brain MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to the two study groups at a ratio of 6:6 (in clusters&#xD;
      of 6 patients). The HBOT/sham treatment includes 60 daily sessions of 90 minutes each, five&#xD;
      days per week. After the treatment period, there will be a maintenance period of HBOT/sham&#xD;
      sessions twice a week for 6 months. All assessments with be done on baseline, after the&#xD;
      treatment period and after the maintenance period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint includes improvement in cognitive scores in neurocognitive evaluations&#xD;
      (Neurotrax). Secondary and tertiary endpoints include changes in cognitive, physiological,&#xD;
      physical, imaging, lab tests and self report questionaires.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Eligible candidates will be randomized with equal probability to the HBOT and sham interventions. Randomization will be performed using a computer software based on patients' code.&#xD;
Since the HBOT chamber can hold six subjects, the randomization will be done in clusters of six patients. After randomization, when a cluster of six subjects from one of the arms will be filled, the intervention for that cluster will begin.&#xD;
Three study technicians will be the only unblinded staff who have the key for the group assignment of each subject. They will exclusively activate the HBOT/sham protocol during session times. All subjects and other clinic staff will remain blinded to the group assignments.</masking_description>
