  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares different music therapy (MT) experiences and their impact on memory and&#xD;
      language in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 12-month study will assess the role of common experiences involving familiar music and&#xD;
      other pleasant events (blinded control) to benefit cognition and measure the quality of life&#xD;
      for people with Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following screening, all participants will meet with a licensed music therapist at the first&#xD;
      study visit. Thereafter, each group will have an individualized schedule of follow-up&#xD;
      telephone calls and visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for the study and participation in the study intervention can be completed&#xD;
      in-person or from your home, if you do not live in the area.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interested participants and their study partner will be enrolled after an evaluation to&#xD;
      determine cognitive impairment or mild dementia. The evaluation, either in person or remote,&#xD;
      will include cognitive testing, clinical and neurological evaluation, a review medical&#xD;
      records and medical history and an examination as deemed necessary by a dementia physician.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will undergo baseline testing including linguistic analyses and will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of 3 intervention groups. Participants and their study partners will&#xD;
      be contacted at least once every three months for cognitive testing and medical review.&#xD;
      Contact with the music therapy team will occur up to twice per week but not less than once&#xD;
      per month, for the first six months study enrollment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, controlled 6 months (24 week) trial to assess the benefits of Homebased MT through Supervised, Supported Singing (H3S) vs control condition receiving attention (AtCon) in persons with ADRD or its prodrome (MCI). A randomized sub group will receive both the H3S and Individualized Music therapy (IMT) during for the same interval. Randomization to H3S, IMT, AtCon will be 2 to 1 to 2, with stratification of disease severity to insure equal representation across arms.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Daily singing of &quot;song of kin&quot;. The song of kin will be derived from an assessment session and evaluation inclusive of an interview under the supervision of Dr. Joanne Loewy and her team at the Louis Armstrong Center for Music and Medicine (LACMM). The interview will include the participant and their study partner who will assist in identifying musical preferences and relevant cultural experiences. A recording of prescribed song protocols will be provided. Participants and study partners will be directed to plan a minimum of 1 hour a day in which the participant will sing along with the study partner-administered song of kin. A diary will be provided to the study partner to record the time of day, amount of time spent and comments on the activity. Study staff will contact the members of this group to confirm compliance with the activity.</description>

    <description>The attention control (AtCon) will meet with the LACMM team for an interview in which they will be asked about music preferences and music experiences. They will answer any questions from participant and caregiver about music experiences. Study staff will contact the members of this group at the same schedule as the H3S group to assess music activity engagement. This will measure unplanned exposure and minimize &quot;drop-in&quot; music activity which could contaminate the control condition.</description>
