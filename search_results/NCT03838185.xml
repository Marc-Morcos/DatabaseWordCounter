      This Phase I clinical study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-design study to thoroughly assess the safety profile and PK properties of J147 in&#xD;
      healthy subjects and to perform a preliminary assessment of the effect of food on safety and&#xD;
      PK parameters of J147. The study will include single ascending dose (SAD) in healthy young&#xD;
      and elderly subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 64 subjects may be included in the study, with an additional 24 to be added&#xD;
      depending on the emerging data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six cohorts of 8 healthy young male subjects and 2 cohorts of 8 healthy elderly male and&#xD;
      female subjects are planned. Depending on emerging safety, tolerability and PK data, 2&#xD;
      additional cohorts of 8 healthy young male subjects in each cohort and 1 additional cohort of&#xD;
      8 elderly male and female subjects may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive a single dose of J147 orally and 2&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to receive a matching dose of placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cohorts will consist of 2 sentinel subjects of whom 1 subject will receive J147 and 1&#xD;
      subject will receive matching placebo. The remaining 6 subjects of whom 5 subjects will&#xD;
      receive J147 and 1 subject will receive matching placebo will be dosed at least 24 hours&#xD;
      following the sentinel subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy elderly subjects will receive doses that have been found to be safe in healthy young&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will receive a single dose of J147 or placebo in a fasted state. The dose levels are planned to be administered in ascending order. Progression to the next dose level, and dose selection, will be based on all available safety and tolerability data up to at least 48 hours post-dose and available PK data (up to at least 24 hours post-dose) from a minimum of 6 subjects (J147 n â‰¥4) in the preceding dose cohort. Healthy elderly subjects will receive doses that have been found to be safe in healthy young subjects.</intervention_model_description>
