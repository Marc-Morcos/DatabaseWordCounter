      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with lecanemab is&#xD;
      superior to placebo on change from baseline of the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite&#xD;
      5 (PACC5) at 216 weeks of treatment (A45 Trial) and to determine whether treatment with&#xD;
      lecanemab is superior to placebo in reducing brain amyloid accumulation as measured by&#xD;
      amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) at 216 weeks of treatment (A3 Trial).&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Any immunological disease which is not adequately controlled, or which requires&#xD;
             treatment with immunoglobulins, systemic monoclonal antibodies (or derivatives of&#xD;
             monoclonal antibodies), systemic immunosuppressants, or plasmapheresis during the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Bleeding disorder that is not under adequate control (including a platelet count&#xD;
             &lt;50,000 or international normalized ratio [INR] &gt;1.5) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Results of laboratory tests conducted during screening that are outside the following&#xD;
             limits:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  acid [MMA]) indicate that it is not physiologically significant&#xD;
&#xD;

             malignant neoplasms but who have had at least 3 years of documented uninterrupted&#xD;
             remission before screening need not be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Known or suspected history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence within 2 years&#xD;
             before screening or a positive urine drug test at screening. Participants who test&#xD;
             positive for benzodiazepines, opioids, or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in urine drug&#xD;
             testing need not be excluded unless in the clinical opinion of the investigator this&#xD;
             is due to potential drug abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Taking prohibited medications&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Participation in a clinical study involving:&#xD;

                  active anti-amyloid vaccine) at any time, unless it can be documented that the&#xD;
                  participant was randomized to placebo or never received study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any immunoglobulin therapy, or vaccine within 6 months before Screening, unless&#xD;
                  it can be documented that the participant was randomized to placebo or never&#xD;
                  received study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lecanemab&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any new chemical entities or investigational drug for AD within 6 months before&#xD;
                  screening unless it can be documented that the participant received only placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any other investigational medication or device study in the 8 weeks or 5&#xD;
                  half-lives (whichever is longer) of the medication before randomization unless it&#xD;
                  can be documented that the participant was in a placebo treatment arm&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Planned surgery during the pre-randomization phase or within 3 months of&#xD;
             randomization, which requires general anesthesia&#xD;
