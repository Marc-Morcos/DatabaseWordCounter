  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ylang-Ylang (Cananga Odorata) essential oil has been postulated to have calming effect, which&#xD;
      may improve BPSD in persons with dementia. This study aims to examine dementia-related&#xD;
      behavioural changes using established assessment tools and brain derived neurotropic factor&#xD;
      (BDNF) in persons with BPSD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) refers to the spectrum of&#xD;
      non-cognitive and non-neurological symptoms of dementia, such as agitation, psychosis,&#xD;
      depression and apathy. Ylang-Ylang (Cananga Odorata) essential oil is postulated to have&#xD;
      calming effect, which may improve BPSD in persons with dementia. Thus, this study aims to&#xD;
      examine dementia-related behavioural changes using established assessment tools and brain&#xD;
      derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) in persons with BPSD. A pre-post quasi-experimental pilot&#xD;
      study will be conducted over a two-month period in nursing homes with persons with dementia.&#xD;
      Approximately 30 persons with dementia are expected to participate in this study. During the&#xD;
      pre-intervention phase, water will be diffused using a diffuser in a common area of the&#xD;
      nursing homes. During the intervention phase, Ylang-Ylang essential oil will be diffused&#xD;
      using the identical diffuser over the same common area. Both water and essential oil will be&#xD;
      diffused twice a day, each for a duration of 20 min during the respective phases. Observation&#xD;
      and documentation of behavioural symptoms will be taken using validated instruments during&#xD;
      the pre- and post-intervention phases. In addition, 10 mL of blood will also be collected at&#xD;
      pre and post intervention for biochemical analyses.If Ylang-ylang essential oil were found to&#xD;
      be beneficial based on the laboratory and observational findings, it can be possibly used as&#xD;
      an alternative approach in managing BPSD.&#xD;
