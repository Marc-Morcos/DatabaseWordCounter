  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to examine the effect of a 5-month period supervised exercise intervention&#xD;
      on brain, cognition, OMICs, Molecular Markers and functional status in older people at risk&#xD;
      of mild cognitive impairment. Secondarily, the effect of this intervention on antioxidant&#xD;
      capacity, lipid metabolism and glucose, physical health (functional capacity, blood pressure,&#xD;
      body composition) and mental (quality of life and depression) will be studied, as well as&#xD;
      other factors risk (genetic and biological) for the development of Alzheimer. A total of 100&#xD;
      people aged between 65 and 75 years old at risk of mild cognitive impairment will be randomly&#xD;
      distributed in the supervised exercise intervention group (n = 50) and control group (n =&#xD;
      50). The design will include a 5-month intervention with measurements at pre and post&#xD;
      intervention and a third measurement (retest) after 3 months of completion. The&#xD;
      multicomponent supervised exercise program will include aerobic, strength, cognitive and&#xD;
      coordinative-agility-balance works, and progression will be established in different load&#xD;
      parameters (frequency, volume, intensity, density). Therefore, randomized controlled studies&#xD;
      are needed to know the specific effect of dose-response considering the various dimensions in&#xD;
      parallel such as neuroimaging, cognitive status and OMICS. This will allow us to understand&#xD;
      from a comprehensive perspective the causes and mechanisms underlying the response. This&#xD;
      project will significantly increase scientific knowledge about the role of exercise on brain&#xD;
      as a therapeutic measure in people at risk of mild cognitive impairment from a&#xD;
      multidimensional perspective. The project will have a significant impact at social and&#xD;
      economic level by transferring the study findings to social and health setting by means of&#xD;
      agents and networks provided for the project.&#xD;

    <description>The telomere length will be measured by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) following the method previusly described. Briefly, the DNA from the cell fraction of the blood will be extracted with the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's specifications. The DNA concentration of the sample, as well as its integrity, will be confirmed in a NanoDrop 2000. For the RT-qPCR the telomeric sequence will be amplified as well as a single copy gene sequence to normalize. Calibration curves will be made with serial dilutions of known concentration of both the gene sequence as well as an oligo specially designed to contain 114 copies of the TTAGGG telomeric sequence. The RT-qPCR will be carried out with 20 ng of DNA using myScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (ROCHE). The PCR conditions are: 10 min at 95 ° C, followed by 40 cycles of 95 ° C for 15 sec and 60 ° C for 1 min, followed by the corresponding dissociation curve.</description>

    <description>All subjects performed a graded exercise test on a treadmill (Lode Valiant, Groningen, Netherlands) until exhaustion. Specifically, a modified Bruce protocol previously used in a similar sample and designed for a geriatric population. Participants were asked if they had ever walking on a treadmill and instructed of the incremental test. If necessary, we familiarized them with the treadmill by walking slowly until the initial protocol speed was achieved. Before start, subjects were instructed not to talk during the test because this is known to affect the breathing and gas exchange. Participants began walking to 2.7 km/h at 0% inclination grade, every 2 minutes the speed or/and inclination were increased according the modified Bruce protocol. VO2peak was considered as the highest observed value of oxygen consumption obtained in the last three intervals of 10 seconds.</description>

    <description>5 months of supervised physical exercise program. The individualized and progressive Health periodization model will be applied establishing an initial individualizing period, as well as identifying any need or adaptation to apply during the exercise program. The physical exercise program will be applied in a period of progressive increase whose initial objective will be to reach the volume and intensity established by the international recommendations of physical activity (http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/) for this population. Briefly, a volume of 150 min/week of moderate-vigorous physical activity (60% -85% reserve heart rate) spread over a maximum of 5 days and including force work 2-3 days/week. The training load will progressively increase with a wave and flexible periodization.</description>

    <description>The methodology will be multicomponent, including aerobic, strength, coordination-cognitive and balance-agility. The physical exercise sessions will be designed in such a way that they work the dimensions but being attractive and motivating for the participants. Each session will include 10 minutes of warm-up with smooth running and mobility exercises; 35-40 minutes of aerobic, strength, coordination-cognitive and balance-agility progressively developed; and 10 minutes back to calm at low intensity with stretching exercises. Nutritional intervention will not be included. For quality purposes, we will use small groups (10-15 pers). After each session participants will be asked about their subjective perception of the effort and the intensity will be controlled by heart rate monitors.</description>
