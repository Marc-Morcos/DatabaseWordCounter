  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive brain disease. It is the most common&#xD;
      form of dementia and the major cause of functional dependence in the elderly. Since there is&#xD;
      currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, a growing number of scientists pointed out the&#xD;
      interest to use non-pharmacological alternative therapeutic approaches in order to slow down&#xD;
      the decline of physical and cognitive resources and improve quality of life of patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. Several narrative and meta-analytical reviews suggest that regular&#xD;
      practice of physical activity delays the occurrence of cognitive decline and slows down&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease progress when compared with sedentary people. Despite the growing&#xD;
      interest of the scientific community for the positive effects of chronic exercise on mental&#xD;
      health and cognitive functions, the clinical reality of this phenomenon remains to be clearly&#xD;
      established, more particularly in aged people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases.The&#xD;
      first aim of this research project is to test if chronic exercise reduces and even&#xD;
      compensates for a cognitive decline in both patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (i.e., no dementia) and aging people with no pathology of central nervous system. The second&#xD;
      aim of this research project is to examine whether an increasing of cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      induced by chronic exercise can explain this positive effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several epidemiologic studies conducted in North America and in Europe have shown that the&#xD;
      regular practice of physical activity, in opposition to a sedentary life, is associated with&#xD;
      a reduced risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. These results have been&#xD;
      strengthened by cross-sectional and interventional studies, which have shown that physical&#xD;
      activity slows down the decline of cognitive functions typically observed in normal and&#xD;
      pathological aging and retards the onset of dementia. The positive effects of chronic&#xD;
      exercise on cerebral and cognitive ageing are now recognised by scientists and clinicians;&#xD;
      however, the mechanisms underlying these effects in humans are poorly understood and there is&#xD;
      a real need for randomised controlled trial (RCT) on this topic. The objective of this&#xD;
      research project is to understand the compensatory mechanisms that may account for the&#xD;
      positive effects of regular physical activity on pathological and non-pathological cerebral&#xD;
      ageing in human and in particular in people presenting prodromal AD. All participants will be&#xD;
      separated into six groups corresponding to the combination of two independent variables: the&#xD;
      population type (aged people without any neurological disease vs. prodromal Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease participants) and the type of physical activity program they will follow during six&#xD;
      months (aerobic and strength exercise program, stretching and balance program, or maintaining&#xD;
      sedentary life style). Cognitive performance, cardiovascular health, brain integrity and&#xD;
      cerebral functioning will be assessed at two or three different times: before the onset of&#xD;
      the training program (pre-test), at the end of the training period (post-test 1) and six&#xD;
      months after the end of the training program (post-test 2).&#xD;
