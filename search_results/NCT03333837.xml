  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a progressive decline in cognition that impairs a person's ability to perform&#xD;
      activities of daily living. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, the most&#xD;
      common neurodegenerative disease in older adults, and the 6th leading cause of death in the&#xD;
      US. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (apathy, depression, anxiety) and altered gait and balance are&#xD;
      prominent secondary symptoms of Alzheimer's disease that increase medical costs and decrease&#xD;
      quality of life for both the person with dementia and their caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a report from the Secretariat (Executive Board, 134th Session, December 20th, 2013), the&#xD;
      World Health Organization identified a need to integrate evidence-based palliative care&#xD;
      services into the continuum of care for serious chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. However, two recent NIH workshops identified major gaps in the evidence supporting&#xD;
      the wider use of non-pharmacologic activities to ameliorate secondary symptoms of chronic&#xD;
      disease. Arts-based activities were identified as particularly understudied for symptom&#xD;
      management, given growing evidence that various arts-based activities can improve quality of&#xD;
      life, relieve symptoms, and reduce reliance on medications. It is important that these&#xD;
      benefits can be achieved without adding medications. Dance is an arts-based activity that can&#xD;
      improve quality of life, decrease symptoms of depression, and improve balance in healthy&#xD;
      older adults, those with Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, dance is a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological intervention that simultaneously addresses two sets of prominent&#xD;
      secondary symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: 1) gait and balance and 2) neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms. However, the mechanisms through which dance exerts these effects are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot data from the investigators' laboratory suggest that participating in a group&#xD;
      improvisational movement class twice weekly improved balance and connectivity in&#xD;
      motor-related brain regions, as well as improving mood and connectivity in brain regions&#xD;
      associated with social engagement. Improvisation is the ability to create new gestures and&#xD;
      movements spontaneously. Improvisation can be a part of many different art forms. However,&#xD;
      improvisational movement can also be practiced as a specific dance form. The objective in&#xD;
      improvisational movement is that choreographed movement is replaced by a cue or prompt that&#xD;
      allows the possibility for multiple responses. This unique form of dance is especially&#xD;
      well-suited for people with dementia because it: 1) does not rely heavily on memory of&#xD;
      repeated movements; 2) can be seamlessly adapted to include sitting, standing, or moving&#xD;
      around the room; 3) is cognitively challenging; and 4) fosters a social, playful atmosphere.&#xD;
      Participants seemed to benefit from both the social nature of the class and the movement.&#xD;
      Therefore, the overall aim of this proposal is to experimentally determine the independent&#xD;
      and combined effects of dance movement and social engagement on quality of life in people&#xD;
      with early stage dementia, and test the neural mechanisms of these effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish this goal, the investigators will use a 2x2 factorial design and randomize 120&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults adjudicated as having early-stage dementia of the presumed&#xD;
      Alzheimer's type to one of four 3-month interventions: 1) Dance Group, 2) Non-group Dance, 3)&#xD;
      Social Group, or 4) No Contact Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not hypothesized that dance affects the underlying disease course, and therefore no&#xD;
      improvement is expected in cognition.&#xD;

    <description>The eSPPB is a brief test of global mobility function with excellent test-retest and inter-examiner reliability; is sensitive to change; is safe, and is a robust predictor of future physical disability and death. To avoid ceiling effects, investigators will use an expanded version (eSPPB) that increases the difficulty of the standing balance task by asking participants to hold postures for 30 instead of 10 seconds, adds a one-leg stand, and adds a narrow walk. The resulting score is normally distributed, continuous, and shows greater sensitivity to change. Dementia patients have lower scores on the SPPB so a favorable outcome for this outcome measure would be a significantly higher score post treatment. The eSPPB is scored as a continuous measure with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 3.0 where 3 is the best possible outcome.</description>

    <description>The Dance Group will participate in 1-hour group improvisational dance lessons 2x/week for 12 weeks. Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.</description>

    <description>The Non-group dance intervention is designed to capture the same dance movement and auditory stimuli as the group class without social interaction. Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.</description>

Games that may be used include 'Balderdash', 'Wise and Otherwise', 'Charades', 'Pictionary', and 'Tell Me A Story' cards. These games will also use the same core strategies as the dance group. Games will be varied within an hour-long session to incorporate pacing and variability into the social group, akin to the dance group. The social group will occur 2x/week for 1 hour each time and be led by the same instructors who lead the Dance Group, to control for effects of personality of the group leader.</description>

    <description>Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem.</description>

    <description>The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise.</description>

    <intervention_name>Social Group</intervention_name>
    <description>The social group will consist of improvisational party games to foster curiosity and playfulness, use imagery, and encourage non-judgment. Games that may be used include 'Balderdash', 'Wise and Otherwise', 'Charades', 'Pictionary', and 'Tell Me A Story' cards. These games will also use the same core strategies as the dance group. Games will be varied within an hour-long session to incorporate pacing and variability into the social group, akin to the dance group. The social group will occur 2x/week for 1 hour each time and be led by the same instructors who lead the Dance Group, to control for effects of personality of the group leader.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>All Persons With Dementia (PWDs) were enrolled with one caregiver each. There was never a time when one was enrolled without the other, so these two people are represented in the participant flow as a dyad.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were enrolled in dyads consisting of one person with dementia (PWD) and one caregiver (CG). Participant flow section includes numbers as dyad since both were considered enrolled. Elsewhere in the record, numbers include either participants with dementia or caregivers as indicated in baseline analysis population description and in outcome titles or descriptions.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Dance Group</title>
          <description>The Dance Group will participate in 1-hour group improvisational dance lessons 2x/week for 12 weeks. Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.&#xD;
Dance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Non-group Dance</title>
          <description>The Non-group dance intervention is designed to capture the same dance movement and auditory stimuli as the group class without social interaction. Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.&#xD;
Non-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise.</description>

          <title>Dance Group</title>
          <description>The Dance Group will participate in 1-hour group improvisational dance lessons 2x/week for 12 weeks. Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.&#xD;
Dance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem.</description>

        <group group_id="B2">
          <title>Non-group Dance</title>
          <description>The Non-group dance intervention is designed to capture the same dance movement and auditory stimuli as the group class without social interaction. Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.&#xD;
Non-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise.</description>

        <description>Self-reported quality of life in the person with dementia is the primary outcome and will be measured using the QOL-AD . The QOL-AD is validated for use in people with Mini Mental State Exam scores as low as 10.The QOL_AD contains 13 items.Points are assigned to each item as follows: poor = 1, fair = 2, good = 3, excellent = 4.The total score is the sum of all 13 item (range 13- 52) higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>

            <title>Dance Group</title>
            <description>The Dance Group will participate in 1-hour group improvisational dance lessons 2x/week for 12 weeks. Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.&#xD;
Dance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem.</description>

            <title>Non-group Dance</title>
            <description>The Non-group dance intervention is designed to capture the same dance movement and auditory stimuli as the group class without social interaction. Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.&#xD;
Non-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise.</description>

Games that may be used include 'Balderdash', 'Wise and Otherwise', 'Charades', 'Pictionary', and 'Tell Me A Story' cards. These games will also use the same core strategies as the dance group. Games will be varied within an hour-long session to incorporate pacing and variability into the social group, akin to the dance group. The social group will occur 2x/week for 1 hour each time and be led by the same instructors who lead the Dance Group, to control for effects of personality of the group leader.&#xD;

            <description>The Dance Group will participate in 1-hour group improvisational dance lessons 2x/week for 12 weeks. Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.&#xD;
Dance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem.</description>

            <title>Non-group Dance</title>
            <description>The Non-group dance intervention is designed to capture the same dance movement and auditory stimuli as the group class without social interaction. Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.&#xD;
Non-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise.</description>

Games that may be used include 'Balderdash', 'Wise and Otherwise', 'Charades', 'Pictionary', and 'Tell Me A Story' cards. These games will also use the same core strategies as the dance group. Games will be varied within an hour-long session to incorporate pacing and variability into the social group, akin to the dance group.

Games that may be used include 'Balderdash', 'Wise and Otherwise', 'Charades', 'Pictionary', and 'Tell Me A Story' cards. These games will also use the same core strategies as the dance group. Games will be varied within an hour-long session to incorporate pacing and variability into the social group, akin to the dance group. The social group will occur 2x/week for 1 hour each time and be led by the same instructors who lead the Dance Group, to control for effects of personality of the group leader.&#xD;

            <description>The Dance Group will participate in 1-hour group improvisational dance lessons 2x/week for 12 weeks. Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.&#xD;
Dance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem.</description>

            <title>Non-group Dance</title>
            <description>The Non-group dance intervention is designed to capture the same dance movement and auditory stimuli as the group class without social interaction. Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.&#xD;
Non-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise.</description>

        <description>Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (FAB) measures balance using 10 different performance-based tests (scored 0 worst - 4 best), including; standing with feet together and eyes closed, standing on a foam pad with eyes closed, walking while turning the head from side to side rhythmically, functional standing reach, turning around to the left and right, stepping up and over a 6-inch box, standing on one leg, and a test for postural reaction. The scale goes from 0-40 with 40 being the best outcome and a cutoff of &lt;=25 for risk of falls.</description>

            <title>Dance Group</title>
            <description>The Dance Group will participate in 1-hour group improvisational dance lessons 2x/week for 12 weeks. Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.&#xD;
Dance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem.</description>

            <title>Non-group Dance</title>
            <description>The Non-group dance intervention is designed to capture the same dance movement and auditory stimuli as the group class without social interaction. Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.&#xD;
Non-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise.</description>

            <description>The social group will consist of improvisational party games to foster curiosity and playfulness, use imagery, and encourage non-judgment. Games that may be used include 'Balderdash', 'Wise and Otherwise', 'Charades', 'Pictionary', and 'Tell Me A Story' cards. These games will also use the same core strategies as the dance group. Games will be varied within an hour-long session to incorporate pacing and variability into the social group, akin to the dance group.

        <title>Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q)</title>
        <description>The NPI is a reliable and valid structured interview designed to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms in person with dementia through a structured interview with the caregiver. The NPI includes questions about 12 domains of symptoms: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression, anxiety, elation/ euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor activity, sleep, and eating. For each, symptom severity is scored on a scale of 0-4, with 4 being the worst outcome and caregiver distress is scored on a scale from 0-5, with 5 being the worst outcome. The sum of all 12 domains is calculated. Severity scores are reported here with a range from 0-36 with a higher score reflecting greater symptom severity.</description>

            <description>The Dance Group will participate in 1-hour group improvisational dance lessons 2x/week for 12 weeks. Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.&#xD;
Dance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem.</description>

            <title>Non-group Dance</title>
            <description>The Non-group dance intervention is designed to capture the same dance movement and auditory stimuli as the group class without social interaction. Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.&#xD;
Non-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise.</description>

        <title>Geriatric Depression Scale</title>
        <description>The person with dementia will be asked to complete a screening tool for assessing depression. This test has 15 yes/no questions with a yes receiving 1 point for a depressive answer. A total score is calculated and will be on a scale from 0-15 with 0-4 indicating no depression, 5-10 suggestive of a mild depression, and 11+ suggestive of severe depression.</description>

            <description>The Dance Group will participate in 1-hour group improvisational dance lessons 2x/week for 12 weeks. Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.&#xD;
Dance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem.</description>

Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.&#xD;
Non-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise.</description>

            <description>The Dance Group will participate in 1-hour group improvisational dance lessons 2x/week for 12 weeks. Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.&#xD;
Dance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem.</description>

            <title>Non-group Dance</title>
            <description>The Non-group dance intervention is designed to capture the same dance movement and auditory stimuli as the group class without social interaction. Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.&#xD;
Non-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise.</description>

        <description>The eSPPB is a brief test of global mobility function with excellent test-retest and inter-examiner reliability; is sensitive to change; is safe, and is a robust predictor of future physical disability and death. To avoid ceiling effects, investigators will use an expanded version (eSPPB) that increases the difficulty of the standing balance task by asking participants to hold postures for 30 instead of 10 seconds, adds a one-leg stand, and adds a narrow walk. The resulting score is normally distributed, continuous, and shows greater sensitivity to change. Dementia patients have lower scores on the SPPB so a favorable outcome for this outcome measure would be a significantly higher score post treatment. The eSPPB is scored as a continuous measure with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 3.0 where 3 is the best possible outcome.</description>

        <description>Center of pressure displacement (area of the 95% confidence ellipse) using an AccuSway forceplate. Center of pressure displacement is one way to characterize postural sway. Increased postural sway is correlated with decreased balance in older adults and increased fall risk. Center of pressure displacement was measured using the area of the 95% confidence ellipse using an AccuSway forceplate. Higher numbers indicate greater levels of postural sway.</description>

            <description>The Dance Group will participate in 1-hour group improvisational dance lessons 2x/week for 12 weeks. Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.&#xD;
Dance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem.</description>

            <title>Non-group Dance</title>
            <description>The Non-group dance intervention is designed to capture the same dance movement and auditory stimuli as the group class without social interaction. Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.&#xD;
Non-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise.</description>

Games that may be used include 'Balderdash', 'Wise and Otherwise', 'Charades', 'Pictionary', and 'Tell Me A Story' cards. These games will also use the same core strategies as the dance group. Games will be varied within an hour-long session to incorporate pacing and variability into the social group, akin to the dance group.

          <description>The social group will consist of improvisational party games to foster curiosity and playfulness, use imagery, and encourage non-judgment. Games that may be used include 'Balderdash', 'Wise and Otherwise', 'Charades', 'Pictionary', and 'Tell Me A Story' cards. These games will also use the same core strategies as the dance group. Games will be varied within an hour-long session to incorporate pacing and variability into the social group, akin to the dance group. The social group will occur 2x/week for 1 hour each time and be led by the same instructors who lead the Dance Group, to control for effects of personality of the group leader.&#xD;

          <description>A No Contact condition captures the condition of no added social contact and no added dance movement. Participants randomized to the No Contact condition will be asked to continue their current disease management and lifestyle for 12 weeks&#xD;
No Contact: The condition of not receiving an intervention can have ethical implications and reduce retention rates. Therefore, these participants will be invited to join in a weekly community improvisational dance class after they complete the study, for as many sessions as they would like.</description>
