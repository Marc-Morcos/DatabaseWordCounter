      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of seltorexant versus placebo on the&#xD;
      sum of Agitation and Aggression domain scores (A plus A) of the Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Inventory-Clinician rating (NPI-C) in participants with probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD)&#xD;
      with clinically significant agitation/aggression.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician Rating (NPI-C) Agitation and Aggression (A plus A) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI-12 is a measure of psychobehavioral disturbances assessing the frequency and severity of disturbances in 12 domains, based on a caregiver interview. Frequency for each domain is rated on a 4-point scale (from 1=rarely to 4=very often) and severity on a 3-point scale (from 1=mild to 3=severe), with the score for each domain being the product of the frequency and severity scores, such that each domain is scored from 1 to 12. The NPI-12 total score is the sum of the 12 domain scores, ranging from 0 (best) to 144 (worst). NPI-C is an instrument developed on the basis of original NPI that gives a score based on product of frequency and severity ratings of 12 symptom domains that can then be summed to a total score. Five domains will be measured in the study with NPI-C: Delusions, Hallucinations, Agitation, Aggression, Dysphoria, and will include both caregiver and participant interviews. Higher scores on the NPI-C are associated with a greater clinical severity of symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Total Cohen-mansfield Agitation Inventory-Community Version (CMAI-C) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The CMAI-C is a 37-item scale that measures the ability of a drug to reduce overall frequency of agitation symptoms, including aggressive behaviors. Individual items are rated on a scale of 1 (never) to 7 (several times per hour) in which a score of 7 represents the most frequent for each item assessed. The total score is a sum of all categories that ranges form 37-259, where higher score indicates greater severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Sleep Disorder Inventory (SDI) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>SDI is based on a caregiver interview and an expanded version of one item of the NPI-12. It describes the frequency, severity, and caregiver burden of sleep-disturbed behaviors during a period prior to its administration. The SDI total score ranges from 0-12 where higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Plasma Concentrations of Seltorexant and its Metabolite</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15 and Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples will be analyzed to measure concentrations of seltorexant and its metabolite using a validated, specific, and sensitive Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) method.</description>
