      To establish a cutoff value using a ratio of CSF tau to Aβ42 (tau/Aβ42) for distinguishing&#xD;
      patients wth mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) from health elderly control subjects.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a cutoff can be found that has at least 80% sensitivity&#xD;
      and 60% specificity.&#xD;

      This study will enroll 50 AD subjects, 50 normal controls and approximately 20 subjects with&#xD;
      non-AD dementia. There will be 2 visits (up to 30 days apart), and a telephone follow-up&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol does not include treatment of subjects. Lumbar puncture and phlebotomy are&#xD;
      routine clinical tasks and are associated with a low level of risk. All adverse events will&#xD;
      be documented and reviewed by the PI.&#xD;

                  Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA)&#xD;
                  criteria, and&#xD;

                  Revision (DSM IV TR) criteria for AD.&#xD;

          -  Must have an MMSE score ≥ 15 and ≤ 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a clear history of cognitive and functional decline over at least one year&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject has a Rosen modified Hachinski Ischemia Score &gt; 4.&#xD;

             that, in the judgment of the investigator, a subject's participation in the trial&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated within the last two months in a clinical trial of a novel&#xD;
             therapeutic agent (e.g. bapineuzumab) or has ever been in a clinical trial of an AD&#xD;
