      The study will use a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of two interventions&#xD;
      (visual arts and music) for individuals with dementia, focusing on dementia of the&#xD;
      Alzheimer's type (DAT). Interventions will be run for 10 weeks in dementia day centers and/or&#xD;
      retirement residences. Participants will be tested before and after the intervention on a&#xD;
      battery of cognitive, affective, and behavioural measures. They will be compared to a&#xD;
      waitlist control group who don't receive the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our research is twofold: treatment of symptoms and improved quality of life&#xD;
      during disease progression in dementia. For the primary aim, the investigators are examining&#xD;
      the potential of arts interventions on declining functions in dementia (memory, mood, and&#xD;
      behavior) to investigate potential treatment effects. Secondly, quality of life will be&#xD;
      measured, with the aim of looking beyond disease progression to contribute to an overall&#xD;
      positive patient experience. Research has indicated the need for non-pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments to be used as a first line of action against dementia symptoms and development.&#xD;
      While, in best practice, pharmacological treatments should be used as a second-line approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Music intervention dropped prior to study initiation.&#xD;

      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older adults age 65 and older, both males and females, with normal or corrected vision and&#xD;
      hearing. Participants will require a diagnosis of dementia, with no other known comorbid&#xD;
      cognitive or neurological impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual arts intervention group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Music intervention group&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Waitlist control group (receiving the intervention after the completion of both testing&#xD;
           sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mixed 2x3 analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each construct, with within-subject factor of&#xD;
           time (pre-intervention and post-intervention) and between-subject factor of group&#xD;
           (visual arts, music, control).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test for confounding effects of background factors (socioeconomic status, education&#xD;
           level, gender, activity participation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mediation analyses for effects of mood on cognition and behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a randomized controlled trial assessing three groups of dementia&#xD;
      patients: a visual art group, a music group, and a non-art waitlist control group. Randomized&#xD;
      control trials are needed in dementia research because few experimental studies exist to&#xD;
      support that training has a causal influence on dementia related decline. Older adults with&#xD;
      dementia will be allocated to either a visual art group, music group, or waitlist control&#xD;
      group. Using two arts forms enables us to have active control groups to examine the&#xD;
      specificity of observed effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address inconsistencies and methodological issues in existing results, the current study&#xD;
      will use rigorous experimental control, such as allocation concealment, adequate sample size,&#xD;
      and tester blinding. Based on a power calculation using effect sizes from previous studies,&#xD;
      each group will have sixty participants for an adequately powered sample. Participants will&#xD;
      be recruited by contacting activity administrators at dementia retirement residences and day&#xD;
      programs. Attention has and will be taken to prevent attrition, such as tailoring&#xD;
      interventions towards participants' needs and capacities, and by involving families and&#xD;
      caregivers in the research. Furthermore, the intervention and assessments will be conducted&#xD;
      at the participant's respective care facility. Currently, the investigators have an&#xD;
      established partnership with day dementia programs in the Toronto area, and will be&#xD;
      negotiating agreements to work with other senior retirement residences and day programs.&#xD;
      Recruiting from multiple locations and randomly assigning participants to experimental or&#xD;
      control groups will help with generalizability of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following previous studies, the art interventions will take place over ten weeks (one hour&#xD;
      per day, two days per week). The visual art course will be a drawing course focusing on basic&#xD;
      visual art concepts (such as shape and contrast) and the music course will be a singing and&#xD;
      instrumental course focusing on basic music concepts (such as rhythm and melody). Defining&#xD;
      training elements will delineate the specific effects of different activities on cognition, a&#xD;
      poorly explored area in previous studies. The visual arts and music courses will be taught by&#xD;
      the study's graduate student investigators (Annalise D'Souza and Katherine Matthews). Both&#xD;
      teachers have experience and accreditations in their respective art.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after both courses, all participants (wait-list control group included) will&#xD;
      complete multiple assessment tasks. Data will be analyzed using mixed analyses of variance to&#xD;
      compare performance for each participant at both testing sessions, and between groups. The&#xD;
      pre-tests will occur one to two weeks before the beginning of the arts courses, and the&#xD;
      post-tests will occur during the two weeks after the art courses are finished. Testing will&#xD;
      occur over a two day period, for one hour per day to accommodate participants attention span&#xD;
      and cognitive load. All tasks have been selected for their reliability, validity, and their&#xD;
      suitability to the population at hand. To investigate specific influences of each art,&#xD;
      separate visual and auditory/verbal tests will be used for each measure. Testing and courses&#xD;
      will begin in early 2015, and will be run multiple times at different locations to reach the&#xD;
      targeted sample size, with expected start dates in April, September, and January. Participant&#xD;
      recruitment for these courses will begin in April and continue until December. Based on&#xD;
      previous discussions with dementia day programs, and the attrition and admission rates of&#xD;
      these programs, attaining sixty participants per group by December will be possible if the&#xD;
      investigators continue recruiting from multiple day programs and retirement residences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants' involvement in the study is completely voluntary and the participant and&#xD;
      their caregiver (if substitute consent is required) may choose to stop their participation at&#xD;
      any time. In the event the participant withdraws from the study all associated collected data&#xD;
      will be immediately destroyed wherever possible. All information the participant supplies&#xD;
      during the study will be held in confidence. Confidentiality will be provided to the fullest&#xD;
      extent possible by law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictions are outlined in the hypotheses below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual art and music training will offset some of the decline in cognitive functions&#xD;
           (working memory, long-term memory, selective attention, dual-tasking, and task&#xD;
           switching).&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Effects of visual art will be greater on visual measures of cognition and effects of&#xD;
           music will be greater on auditory measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Visual art and music training will improve mood and lessen problematic behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visual art and music training will improve overall quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mood will mediate some of the changes in cognition and behaviour&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study focuses on non-pharmacological art interventions for persons with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Arts interventions will be designed and&#xD;
      implemented to investigate the effects of arts training on disease symptomology and overall&#xD;
      quality of life for persons with dementia. Dementia can be characterized by declining&#xD;
      cognitive functions, accompanied by a loss of daily functioning (DSM-IV, 2000), with a range&#xD;
      of cognitive, behavioural, and psychological deficits for different types of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a randomized controlled trial to test efficacy of two arts interventions.&#xD;
      Arts and dementia experts will guide intervention design to ensure that programs are powerful&#xD;
      and controlled. With the aims of reliability and applicability, interventions will be created&#xD;
      that can be tested by future researchers and applied by real-world practitioners. Effects&#xD;
      will be evaluated with a broad range of measures (affective, cognitive, and behavioural. The&#xD;
      proposed study is significant for two reasons. First, it addresses a repeatedly highlighted&#xD;
      need for non-pharmacological interventions in treating dementia. Second, it looks beyond&#xD;
      disease treatment alone by looking to also improve overall quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological interventions offer great potential for mental improvement, but further&#xD;
      experimental research is needed before efficacy is established. A large evidence base&#xD;
      demonstrates a cognitive benefit of arts on healthy older adults. It is uncertain however,&#xD;
      whether such findings also apply to individuals with dementia. A few preliminary studies&#xD;
      indicate similar benefits can be found, but not all studies have reported cognitive&#xD;
      improvements following arts interventions in this patient population. In addition,&#xD;
      prospective studies indicate a link between dementia and cognitively stimulating activities&#xD;
      such as the arts. For example, it has been supported that older adults who participate in&#xD;
      more stimulating activities also display fewer incidences of dementia and Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research suggests that non-pharmacological treatments should be used as a first line of&#xD;
      action against dementia, while pharmacological treatments should serve as a second-line&#xD;
      approach. While non-pharmacological treatments have indicated remedial effects, there is a&#xD;
      need for reliably conducted experiments to establish efficacy. Art recreation is easy to&#xD;
      administer, inexpensive and non-time consuming. Unlike the majority of current&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments, it is a noninvasive and pleasurable activity, and maintains the&#xD;
      personhood of the individual with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Music intervention dropped prior to study initiation, due to insufficient participant&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;
