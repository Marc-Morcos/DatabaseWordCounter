      treatment as usual and a control message.150 participants will be recruited from three UW&#xD;

      This clinical trial record represents Aim 3 of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias&#xD;
      (ADRD) Prevention Messaging to Increase Smoking Cessation Attempts in Older Adult Smokers.&#xD;
      The objective of this research is to develop and test a readily translatable Stage 1&#xD;
      motivational intervention for smoking cessation in older adults consisting of 1) a novel&#xD;
      patient-informed motivational message promoting smoking cessation and 2) clear access routes&#xD;
      to evidence-based treatments for smoking cessation within a healthcare setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: Develop motivational interventions that include motivational and access messages&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: Evaluate motivational intervention content using an online survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: Examine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a new OSMI in real-world&#xD;
           clinical settings compared to treatment as usual and a control message&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview. Aim 3 will use a pre-post design to assess feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of one novel OSMI (identified in Aim 2) presented in a 1st clinic, one control&#xD;
      motivational message with a standard health-and Evidenced-Based Smoking Treatment (EBST)&#xD;
      access-related content (i.e., &quot;Quitting smoking is the best thing you can do for your health.&#xD;
      Call 1-800-QUIT-NOW for help.&quot;) in a 2nd clinic, and a 3rd clinic serving as a&#xD;
      no-intervention control. The motivational interventions will be delivered via multiple routes&#xD;
      at both treatment clinics (i.e., mailer, in-clinic poster, and telephone calls from UW-CTRI&#xD;
      staff) to ensure maximum saturation. These delivery routes are consistent with chronic care&#xD;
      approaches to treatment currently implemented in UW-Health clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. Patients from three UW-Health primary care clinics (N=150) who are ages 50-80,&#xD;
      report being a current smoker at their clinic visit (confirmed via EHR), and do not hold a&#xD;
      current diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (confirmed via EHR), will be&#xD;
      eligible to participate. Each wave of data collection will be conducted separately, allowing,&#xD;
      but not requiring, participants to be in multiple waves within their clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting/Recruitment. UW-Health is an integrated health system caring for more than 600,000&#xD;
      patients each year at seven hospitals and 86 clinics (26 Primary Care Clinics serving&#xD;
      adults). The three UW-Health clinics selected will be chosen based on maximum representation&#xD;
      of older adult smokers and prioritized subgroups (African-Americans, women, those with&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidities, and low socioeconomic status (SES) smokers). Potentially eligible&#xD;
      participants will be identified via an EHR registry at the beginning of each wave. Prior to&#xD;
      wave 1, potential participants will be sent an &quot;opt-out letter&quot; informing them of potential&#xD;
      upcoming calls from University of Wisconsin - Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention&#xD;
      (UW-CTRI) staff to discuss their smoking beliefs and behaviors over the next 6 months. If&#xD;
      they do not want to receive these calls, they can call a provided number and let staff know&#xD;
      that they do not want to be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and Assessments. The study will include three separate waves: Wave 1 (baseline;&#xD;
      months 1-3), Wave 2 (intervention implementation; months 4-6), and Wave 3 (follow-up; months&#xD;
      7-9). During Wave 1, 25 participants from each of the three clinics will provide informed&#xD;
      consent and complete a telephone assessment (lasting ~25 minutes) 4-6 days after their&#xD;
      primary care visit. Wave 2 telephone assessments will occur 4-6 days after intervention&#xD;
      exposure. Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs assessed include: perceived severity (e.g.,&#xD;
      impact of smoking on ADRD/cancer/stroke/etc. risk; personal risk for&#xD;
      ADRD/cancer/stroke/etc.), perceived benefits (i.e., efficacy of EBSTs; impact of quitting on&#xD;
      ADRD/cancer/stroke risk), perceived barriers (i.e., knowledge of how to access EBSTs in&#xD;
      healthcare setting), and self-efficacy (i.e., confidence in ability to quit in the next 30&#xD;
      days). At the end of each wave, an EHR review of eligible patients who had primary care&#xD;
      visits during that wave will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses. This study will evaluate feasibility and preliminary effects of the OSMI and inform&#xD;
      power analyses for a future R01 application. Preliminary effectiveness will be evaluated by&#xD;
      descriptively comparing primary (1) and secondary (2) outcomes longitudinally (Wave 1 vs. 2)&#xD;
      within clinics, as well as cross-sectionally comparing Wave 2 data across clinic sites&#xD;
      (Intervention Message Clinic vs. Control Message Clinic; Intervention Message Clinic vs.&#xD;
      Control Clinic (treatment as usual (TAU)); TAU vs. Control Message Clinic). Feasibility&#xD;
      during Wave 2 will be assessed via receipt and comprehension of messages. The HBM outcomes&#xD;
      will be compared longitudinally (Wave 1 vs. 2) within clinics to identify potential&#xD;
      mechanisms of action for the interventions and identify potential changes to the&#xD;
      interventions prior to a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT). The EHR data will be&#xD;
      critically evaluated to determine what available EHR data are markers of response to&#xD;
      motivational interventions, which will inform the use of EHR data in a larger R01&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) domains&#xD;
      preliminarily assessed will include (1) Reach: patient rate of intervention receipt including&#xD;
      what delivery modality (i.e., mailer, poster, call), how often it was seen/received&#xD;
      recollection, and comprehension of motivational and access message; (2) Efficacy on&#xD;
      smoking-cessation related beliefs and intentions (i.e., motivation to quit, quit attempts,&#xD;
      and use of EBSTs in the healthcare setting); and (3) Maintenance: duration of Wave 3 to&#xD;
      assess the duration of potential impact of the intervention to guide whether the duration of&#xD;
      exposure (3 months) will need to be modified in future studies for optimized effectiveness.&#xD;
