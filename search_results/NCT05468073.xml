    <textblock>
      Study aims at evaluating the therapeutic efficacy and safety of low-dose IL-2&#xD;
      immunomodulatory treatment in patients with early AD, in a phase II, randomized, double&#xD;
      blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial. Patients with AD at early stage will be&#xD;
      recruited and randomized (2:1) in each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the rate of decline assessed through CDR change at 18 months between&#xD;
      the placebo group and the treated patients.&#xD;

      This study aims to investigate the immunomodulatory therapeutic potential and safety of&#xD;
      low-dose (ld) IL-2 in a randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative diagnosis criteria based on clinical and CSF biomarkers have been established to&#xD;
      avoid risks of misdiagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment consist of 21 cures of subcutaneous injections of either placebo or low-dose&#xD;
      (5MIU/day) IL-2 (PROLEUKIN ®). Patients will receive 5 consecutive injections during the&#xD;
      induction phase which will be followed by a week break. During the maintenance phase a total&#xD;
      of 16 injections will be administered weekly. Total duration of treatment for each patient is&#xD;
      anticipated to be 18 weeks. Patients will be followed-up for 18 months after the first&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion, in addition to the clinical evaluation, a hybrid PET/MRI (using [18F]-DPA-714)&#xD;
      scan will be performed. After randomized patients successfully complete the treatment phases,&#xD;
      they will be followed-up through 3 clinical and 1 neuroimaging visits to assess cogitive and&#xD;
      functional decline. Clinical visits are scheduled at 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment&#xD;
      induction. Another hybrid PET/MRI (using [18F]-DPA-714) scan will be performed at 19 months&#xD;
      following induction.&#xD;
