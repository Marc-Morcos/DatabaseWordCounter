      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of aducanumab over 100 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment after a wash-out period imposed by discontinuation of feeder studies in&#xD;
      participants who had previously received aducanumab (i.e. previously treated participants) or&#xD;
      who had previously received placebo (i.e. treatment-naïve participants).&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, life-threatening event, requires inpatient hospitalization, significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Has one informant/care partner who, in the Investigator's opinion, has frequent and&#xD;
