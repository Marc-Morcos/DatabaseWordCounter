    <textblock>
      This investigation is designed to study how the brain functions when it is performing&#xD;
      explicit memory tasks, and furthermore how the brain systems supporting performance on these&#xD;
      tests change as a function of aging. Implicit memory tasks may be distinguished from explicit&#xD;
      memory tests in that explicit memory characterizes the directed or intentional recollection&#xD;
      of previously learned information or events. In contrast, implicit (or nonconscious) memory&#xD;
      is expressed in the facilitation of performance on some task or judgment on a stimulus owing&#xD;
      to a prior presentation of that stimulus, without any necessary conscious awareness of the&#xD;
      prior presentation. The investigators propose to use functional Magnetic resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) to measure brain activity during the performance of carefully designed explicit memory&#xD;
      tasks. Comparison of brain activity during the different test conditions will provide&#xD;
      information about the brain areas that are involved in mediating specific aspects of&#xD;
      performance. Both older and younger individuals will be tested in order to understand age&#xD;
      related changes in the brain activity. In order to examine the interactions between&#xD;
      participants' differential levels of amyloid burden and their performance on cognitive tasks&#xD;
      and fMRI neural activation, the investigators also propose PET imaging of older participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The basic approach to measuring the brain activity associated with a given cognitive process&#xD;
      (or processes) is as follows: It is known that increases in brain neuronal activity are&#xD;
      associated with local increases in energy metabolism. Under normal circumstances, increases&#xD;
      in brain metabolism lead to local changes in blood oxygenation in venules and larger veins.&#xD;
      This change in blood oxygenation can be detected imaging methods which are sensitive to the&#xD;
      differences in magnetic state between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate benefit of this research is to better understand how changes in both performance&#xD;
      and the brain organization underlying that performance are affected by aging.&#xD;

        Subjects will be recruited from ads placed in local newspapers and notices posted in the&#xD;
        vicinity of Columbia University, the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, and in local&#xD;
        senior centers that provide written consent for notice placement. We will also utilize a&#xD;
        market mailing approach. Letters will be sent to appropriately aged potential subjects&#xD;
        randomly selected from commercial lists. Additional elderly subjects will be recruited from&#xD;
        the Sergievsky Joint Database. Informed consent will be elicited from all subjects.&#xD;
