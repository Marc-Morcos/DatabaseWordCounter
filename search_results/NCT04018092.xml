  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this multi-site double blinded randomized sham-controlled Phase II clinical trial&#xD;
      is to test a novel, relatively low cost, low risk, and potentially high impact therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention in older adults who are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. The&#xD;
      intervention involves transcranial and intranasal delivery of near infrared (NIR) light via&#xD;
      light emitting diodes, aka photobiomodulation. The overall hypothesis, based on animal and&#xD;
      pilot studies, is that exposure to NIR stimulation will have beneficial effects on brain&#xD;
      health via influence on mitochondrial function as measured by changes in 31P MRS-based&#xD;
      markers of ATP, neural network changes in functional connectivity (rs-fMRI), and improved&#xD;
      cognitive performance. To test this hypothesis, 168 older adults with subjective cognitive&#xD;
      complaints, and a first-degree family history of Alzheimer's disease will be randomized to&#xD;
      sham or real treatment groups. Neuromiaging and ocgnitive outcome measures will be obtained,&#xD;
      before and after a 12-week intervention involving transcranial and intranasal NIR-PBM. The&#xD;
      intervention protocol will involve &quot;lab&quot; and &quot;home&quot; sessions, and a 3 month post-intervention&#xD;
      follow-up. This trial will determine: 1) whether NIR stimulation, relative to sham, improves&#xD;
      performance on memory and executive tasks sensitive to hippocampal and frontal brain function&#xD;
      in older adults with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease; 2) whether NIR stimulation,&#xD;
      relative to sham, enhances brain function and connectivity measured by changes in MRS&#xD;
      phosphorous ATP and resting state functional connectivity; and 3) how differences in&#xD;
      demographic, neuroimaging, and Alzheimer-related risk factors influence the brain response to&#xD;
      NIR stimulation versus sham in older adults with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
      Results will provide key insights into whether this novel NIR intervention can enhance&#xD;
      cognition in older adults with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and will provide the&#xD;
      necessary data for a future Phase III randomized clinical trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This multi-site randomized sham controlled trial proposes to test a novel, non-invasive, low&#xD;
      risk and low cost brain stimulation approach for enhancing cognition and brain health in&#xD;
      cognitively normal older adults who are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. The&#xD;
      intervention involves transcranial and intranasal delivery of near-infrared light (NIR;&#xD;
      808-904 nm) via light emitting diodes placed on the scalp or intranasally using a dosing that&#xD;
      resulted in positive effects in our pilot studies. We plan to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      targeted NIR stimulation will have positive effects on brain health via influence on&#xD;
      mitochondrial function as measured by changes in Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)-based&#xD;
      markers of ATP, neural network changes as indexed by changes in functional connectivity based&#xD;
      on resting state-fMRI, and improved cognitive performance. We plan to randomize 168 older&#xD;
      adults, ages 65-89 years, to Active or Sham intervention conditions. To be included,&#xD;
      participants must have subjective cognitive complaints, based on an index of Subjective&#xD;
      Cognitive Impairment (SCI), and a family history of Alzheimer's disease in a first degree&#xD;
      relative. Performance on standardized neuropsychological measures must be unimpaired&#xD;
      psychometricallyl. The intervention itself will last for 12 weeks and include lab sessions&#xD;
      (16 total) and daily at home sessions. In the lab, both transcranial and intranasal delivery&#xD;
      of NIR light will be delivered using Medx and Vielight stimulation technologies, whereas the&#xD;
      daily at home sessions will involve intranasal stimulation only. The sham and active&#xD;
      conditions are identical in all respects except that sham devices will not deliver NIR&#xD;
      stimulation. The primary outcome is an episodic memory measure involving spatial navigation&#xD;
      that is linked to hippocampal function, sensitive to MCI and Alzheimer's disease, and an&#xD;
      analogue to the Morris Water maze. Secondary outcomes include executive function task and&#xD;
      neuroimaging indicators of ATP function (31-P MRS) and connectivity changes based on rs-fMRI.&#xD;
      Exploratory outcomes include 'traditional' neuropsychological measures that are used&#xD;
      clinically, along with measures and indices (e.g., APOE-4 status)that might potentially&#xD;
      mediate or moderate study outcome. Assessments will occur at baseline (Month 1), after 12&#xD;
      weeks of intervention (Month 4), and 3 month post intervention (Month 7). Imaging outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed only at baseline and at Month 4. Our primary aim is focused on cognition and&#xD;
      will test whether NIR intervention, relative to sham, will produce pre-post improvement on&#xD;
      tasks of recent memory (primary outcome) and executive function in older adults who are at&#xD;
      increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. Our secondary aim is focused on neuroimaging and will&#xD;
      test whether NIR intervention, relative to sham, will enhance brain markers of MRS-ATP&#xD;
      (secondary outcome) and increase functional connectivity as indexed by resting state fMRI.&#xD;
      The 3rd aim is exploratory and will evaluated how baseline demographic, genetic, neuroimaging&#xD;
      and other factors influence individual differences in cognitive outcome for NIR intervention.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to the Active or Sham condition. The study biostatistician will randomize participants using a 1:1 allocation scheme with stratification based on age, education, and sex. When a new participant arrives, she/he will be randomized to Active or Sham groups depending on covariate characteristics (age, education, sex) and the cumulative distribution of assignments regarding these variables at that point.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Use of a sham-controlled approach provides stringent experimental control, enabling the investigators to control for placebo/expectations, behavioral activation (engaging in study procedures) and practice effects related to repeated administration of the same cognitive tasks.&#xD;
The MedX and Vielight devices used for delivery of active and sham NIR stimulation are identical in all respects regarding design, warmth and operation, except that no stimulation is delivered by the sham devices. Because NIR light is invisible, participants will not be able to discern if receiving active or sham stimulation. The participants, interventionists, and outcome assessors will be blinded to the participants' intervention status: Active vs Sham. At completion of the study, all participants will receive a Placebo Control Questionnaire that asks questions pertaining to what group the participant had been assigned. This data will be examined to determine the effectiveness of blinding.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in Active group ARENA scores compared to Sham group ARENA scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is a spatial navigation task (ARENA), a human analogue to the Morris WaterMaze. Participants navigate a virtual room on a computer. The task consists of 3 phases: practice, learning, and memory probe. During the learning trials, the target is invisible until the participant hovers over it. The target is located in the same location and the participant must use spatial cues to locate it. In the memory probe trial, the target is removed unbeknownst to the participant. On each learning trial, path length, time to acquire the target, and target acquisition (yes-no) are recorded. On the probe trial, path length and percent of time spent in each quadrant are recorded. The primary outcome is a composite z score, consisting of mean z scores for the following: path length(.25 weight)+time to acquire target (.25 weight)+time spent in proximal target on trial 9(.50 weight). Higher Z scores indicate better performance. Expected range of composite Z is -4 to 4.</description>

    <description>For transcranial stimulation, the study team will use two MedX units (1116 Rehab Console, MedX Health), whereas intranasal stimulation is delivered using the 810 Intranasal device (Vielight Inc). During each lab session, six transcranial LED clusters will be placed on the scalp in two distinct configurations guided by 10-20 EEG system. Total transcranial stimulation time is 40 minutes, 20 min per cluster. Concurrently, two 810 intranasal devices will be placed in each nostril for 25 min of total dose per nostril. For at home sessions, participants will use the standalone 810 Intranasal device only.&#xD;
Total amount of sessions:&#xD;
16 sessions of stimulation will occur in the laboratory. Each session will last approximately 90 minutes and will include two 20-minute segments of NIR stimulation.&#xD;
AND&#xD;
44 sessions of intranasal stimulation in the home. Each session will last 25 minutes and will occur on weekdays when there is no in-lab session.</description>
