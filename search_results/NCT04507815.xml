      There are currently no disease-modifying treatments for cognitive and behavioral symptoms&#xD;
      associated with early clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), and only minimally effective&#xD;
      symptomatic treatments are available. In this application, we propose a transcranial direct&#xD;
      current stimulation (tDCS) augmented executive functioning training intervention. This&#xD;
      intervention will target cognition and brain circuits that are impaired in patients with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. The goal is to improve cognitive performance and&#xD;
      functional outcomes in patients with MCI and early AD.&#xD;

      Objectives There are currently no disease-modifying treatments for cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      symptoms associated with early clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), and only minimally&#xD;
      effective symptomatic treatments are available. In this application, we propose a&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) augmented executive functioning training&#xD;
      intervention. This intervention will target cognition and brain circuits that are impaired in&#xD;
      patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. The goal is to improve cognitive&#xD;
      performance and functional outcomes in patients with MCI and early AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan and Methods This study will recruit 50 Veterans with MCI or very early AD who&#xD;
      are receiving outpatient services at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System (MVAHCS) Geriatric&#xD;
      Research, Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC) Memory Loss Clinic. This study will be a&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, placebo (sham) controlled study. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either active or sham tDCS, both paired with cognitive training tasks.&#xD;
      Ten sessions of training/tDCS sessions (20 minutes of 2mA current stimulation with 45 minutes&#xD;
      of cognitive training tasks) will occur over 2-3 weeks, performed at the participant's home.&#xD;
      Participants will attend an in-person enrollment and training session prior to study&#xD;
      intervention. Follow-up sessions will occur via phone or video conference at 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      after study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Relevance Executive cognitive impairments in patients with MCI or early AD have been&#xD;
      associated with poor decision-making ability and lack of insight, potentially leading to&#xD;
      compromised job performance, financial mismanagement, increased personal safety risk,&#xD;
      relationship stress, and poor medical treatment adherence. While disproportionate memory&#xD;
      impairment is a hallmark of both conditions, there are compensatory strategies available to&#xD;
      reduce disability associated with very early stage memory impairment in those who are&#xD;
      otherwise cognitively intact. Compensatory strategies are much less effective for executive&#xD;
      dysfunction, as the disability itself impairs one's ability to recognize when such strategies&#xD;
      are needed and successfully employ them. Novel, well-tolerated, neuroplasticity-based&#xD;
      interventions that can reduce executive impairment by targeting both cognitive control (an&#xD;
      executive ability) and its underlying neural dysfunction are needed to improve cognitive&#xD;
      outcomes, safety, and quality of life for patients with MCI or early AD. Knowledge gained&#xD;
      from this study can inform the future development of clinical treatment approaches aimed at&#xD;
      reducing risk and delaying out-of-home placement in Veterans with cognitive impairment.&#xD;

    <description>Differences in magnitude of change in BTACT scores between active tDCS and sham groups from baseline to follow-up sessions. BTACT covers five cognitive domains: episodic verbal memory (list learning), working memory span (digits backwards), executive functioning (verbal fluency), inductive reasoning (number series completion), and processing speed (backwards counting). Higher total score on the BTACT indicates better cognitive performance.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive 10 sessions of cognitive training concurrent with sham tDCS. For sham tDCS, electrodes are placed at the same locations as for active tDCS, but current is ramped up for the initial 30 secs, then immediately ramped back down. This ramp up/down method is done at the end of the stimulation period, as well. This method mimics the physical sensation of stimulation typically encountered at the very beginning and end of the intervention period.</description>
