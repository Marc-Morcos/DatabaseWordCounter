    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the signs and symptoms of irregular&#xD;
      sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD) that are important to patients and caregivers of patients&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD-D), AD-D with cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and/or&#xD;
      vascular dementia (VaD) and ISWRD, and to draft an instrument or instruments to assess them.&#xD;
