  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nursing home (NH) patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias often receive&#xD;
      unwanted, burdensome treatments such as hospitalization. Advance care planning (ACP) is a key&#xD;
      strategy to support patients and family-caregivers in making informed decisions and ensuring&#xD;
      treatment preferences are proactively known and honored. The ACP Specialist Program will&#xD;
      improve care and reduce unwanted, burdensome hospitalizations through improved ACP&#xD;
      procedures, standardized staff education on ACP, and systematic ACP facilitation delivered by&#xD;
      existing NH staff.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A significant number of patients Alzheimer's disease or related dementia diagnoses will be&#xD;
      cared for in nursing homes near the end of life. Unfortunately, many of these patients&#xD;
      experience unwanted and burdensome medical treatments, such as potentially avoidable&#xD;
      hospitalizations, that negatively impact quality of life. Advance care planning (ACP)&#xD;
      discussions with patients and family caregivers are important to explore goals in advance of&#xD;
      a crisis and support informed, values-based decision-making. The ACP process helps ensure&#xD;
      that preferences about treatments such as hospitalization are known, documented, and honored.&#xD;
      Research indicates that ACP can reduce burdensome treatments and increase the likelihood that&#xD;
      care will match documented preferences. Nursing homes are currently required by regulations&#xD;
      to offer ACP to patients and families. However, there are no training requirements for&#xD;
      nursing home staff and approaches to fulfilling this regulatory and ethical responsibility&#xD;
      vary widely, resulting in inconsistent ACP. The &quot;Aligning Patient Preferences - a Role&#xD;
      Offering Alzheimer's patients, Caregivers, and Healthcare providers Education and Support&#xD;
      (APPROACHES)&quot; trial will test the ACP Specialist Program. Existing nursing home staff members&#xD;
      will be trained to enhance care and reduce unwanted, burdensome hospitalizations through&#xD;
      improved ACP procedures, standardized staff education on ACP, and systematic ACP&#xD;
      facilitation. The primary trial outcome is hospital transfers (admissions and emergency&#xD;
      department visits) per 1000 person-days alive. Consistent with the spirit of a pragmatic&#xD;
      trial, study outcomes rely on data already collected for quality improvement, clinical or&#xD;
      billing purposes. In the 18 month R21 pilot phase, the aims are to: 1) Establish the trial's&#xD;
      organizational structure and processes; and 2) Pilot test the intervention in 4 nursing&#xD;
      homes. In the R33 phase, a pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial will be conducted in&#xD;
      partnership with 3 nursing home corporations who operate a combined total of 206 diverse&#xD;
      urban and rural facilities in 14 states. The aims of the 42 month R33 phase are to: 3)&#xD;
      Evaluate the primary outcome of hospital transfers over 12 months among patients with&#xD;
      dementia in intervention versus control nursing homes; and 4) Compare ACP documentation,&#xD;
      measures of quality of care at the end of life, and patient and family satisfaction between&#xD;
      the intervention versus control nursing homes. If successful, the ACP Specialist Program will&#xD;
      be primed for rapid translation into nursing home practice to reduce unwanted, burdensome&#xD;
      hospitalizations and improve quality of care for patients with dementia.&#xD;
