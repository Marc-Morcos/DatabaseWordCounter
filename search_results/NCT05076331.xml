    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to study the aging brain among participants enrolled in the&#xD;
      Health and Aging Brain Study: Health Disparities project . There are a number of things that&#xD;
      can influence how people think as they age, including diabetes, depression, as well as our&#xD;
      biology. In this study, the investigators seek to study the aging brain by using brain PET&#xD;
      scans that create detailed pictures of the brain.&#xD;

      There are a number of things that can influence how we think as people age, including&#xD;
      diabetes, depression, as well as our biology. In this study, the investigators are using PET&#xD;
      scans with a tracer to create detailed pictures of the brain. This information will be used&#xD;
      to help the investigators understand how the brain ages and in the future could be used to&#xD;
      develop better diagnostics and treatments for Alzheimer's disease and memory loss in Mexican&#xD;
      Americans, African Americans, and non-Hispanic whites. The goal of this study is to address&#xD;
      this disparity by enrolling ethnically diverse participants in this study.&#xD;
