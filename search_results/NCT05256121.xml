  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has no cure putting prevention-strategies in the&#xD;
      forefront for impeding the public health and personal consequences of this devastating&#xD;
      disease. Seven major potentially modifiable risk factors show consistent association with AD&#xD;
      (midlife type 2 diabetes [T2D], midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, physical inactivity,&#xD;
      depression, smoking, and low educational attainment), with combined population-attributable&#xD;
      risk of 30%1. A recent extensive literature review of randomized control trials on single&#xD;
      lifestyle interventions for AD yielded negative results. The multidomain preDIVA2,3&#xD;
      (Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care) and MAPT4,5 (Multidomain Alzheimer&#xD;
      Prevention Trial) studies raised concerns regarding the multidomain approach. The multidomain&#xD;
      lifestyle model approach of the FINGER6,7 study (Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to&#xD;
      Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability) brought some optimism after it presented&#xD;
      positive results; several replication trials around the world have been launched8. However,&#xD;
      1) all trials focus on the elderly, 2) the impact of midlife risk factors on dementia risk is&#xD;
      stronger than late life, and 3) the neurodegenerative changes in AD begin decades before its&#xD;
      clinical manifestations9. A recent study showed that 2 or more cardiovascular risk factors in&#xD;
      midlife (but not late life) predicted amyloid aggregation10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the feasibility and provide pilot data on effectiveness of a novel &quot;real-life&quot;&#xD;
      personalized 18-months intervention for prevention of cognitive decline in middle-aged&#xD;
      individuals (age 40-65-year-old) at high AD risk due to AD parental family history. We will&#xD;
      implement an approach &quot;diary-monitoring&quot; (&quot;Risk factors log&quot; which will filled daily by&#xD;
      participants, using the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) software's survey) with&#xD;
      study team guidance. We hypothesize that daily risk-factors documentation in personal &quot;Risk&#xD;
      factors log&quot; will increase participant's engagement in the intervention and will enable the&#xD;
      study team to accumulate health information, in order to improve support and counselling for&#xD;
      improvement of risk factors. In addition to examining the feasibility of our approach, we&#xD;
      will explore its effectiveness in both improving risk factors values, as well as improving&#xD;
      cognitive function by comparing the HAPPCAP-AD intervention group to &quot;control group&quot;. Last,&#xD;
      our study will lay the foundations for a strong long-term large-scale preventive intervention&#xD;
      in the future. We will compare this group to a partially passive control.&#xD;
