  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely related to diabetes (DM). DM will aggravate the&#xD;
      progression of AD, but the specific mechanism has not yet been clarified. Previous study&#xD;
      found that a key pathological feature of the pancreas in patients with DM is islet amyloid&#xD;
      polypeptide, and there is also islet amyloid polypeptide in the brain. Therefore, DM may&#xD;
      cause cytotoxicity through the interaction between pancreatic amyloid and brain Aβ protein&#xD;
      and further aggravate AD progress. In this study, starting with DM and AD pathological&#xD;
      biomarkers, the amyloid PET target molecular probe 18F-AV45 will be used to monitor the&#xD;
      dynamic changes of amyloid protein in the brain and pancreas during the development of AD.&#xD;
      The completion of this study will provide a new view for understanding the mechanism of DM on&#xD;
      AD cognitive dysfunction and effectively preventing and treating these two diseases.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, prospective, and observational study, which mainly focuses on the&#xD;
      interaction between pancreatic amyloid and brain Aβ protein and further aggravates AD&#xD;
      progress in China. PET imaging will be used on subjects. Previously collected patient data&#xD;
      may also be enrolled in this study.&#xD;

                  than or equal to Upper limit of normal range; liver function: bilirubin, AST&#xD;
                  (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to the upper limit of normal range;&#xD;
                  electrocardiogram: no significant abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Willingness and ability to cooperate with all projects of this research.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Age between 60 and 80 years old; gender is not limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The diagnosis of AD was based on the 2011 National Association on Aging and&#xD;
             Alzheimer's Disease (NIA-AA) diagnostic criteria for possible AD dementia. The&#xD;
             diagnostic criteria for diabetes were based on the 1999 World Health Organization&#xD;
             (WHO) diagnostic criteria for diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Brain MRI supports the diagnosis of AD, and there is no evidence of other neurological&#xD;
             diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No neurological disease, major chronic disease, malignant tumor or acute infectious&#xD;
             disease has been confirmed by the investigator.&#xD;
