  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2b randomized, double-blind, Placebo-controlled study with 2 treatment arms,&#xD;
      to compare the efficacy and safety of AstroStem vs. Placebo treatment in patients with mild&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease(AD). Eligible patients diagnosed with AD within one year of the start of&#xD;
      treatment will be enrolled. Patients who are randomized into the treatment group will be&#xD;
      administered via intravenously AstroStem every 4 weeks from Week 0 to Week 36. On the other&#xD;
      hand, patients who are randomized into the placebo control group will receive Placebo every 4&#xD;
      weeks from Week 0 to Week 36. After the final administration, patients will be scheduled for&#xD;
      two follow-up visits, at Weeks 44 and 52, to assess efficacy and safety endpoints.&#xD;

The NPI is a structured interview with a caregiver or qualified study partner (defined as having direct contact &gt; 2 days/week) that evaluates both presence and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric features which include: delusions, hallucinations, dysphoria, anxiety, agitation/aggression, euphoria, disinhibition, irritability, lability, apathy, aberrant motor behavior, night-time behavior, and appetite/ eating changes. If the response to the domain question is &quot;No&quot;, the informant goes to the next question. If &quot;Yes&quot;, the informant then rates both the Severity of the symptoms present within the last month on a 3-point scale ranging from 1 to 3 (mild to severe).</description>
