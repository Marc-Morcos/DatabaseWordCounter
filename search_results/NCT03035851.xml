  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The estimated annual cost of dementia in Canada is $15 billion, with a projected cumulative&#xD;
      economic burden of $800 billion by 2038. Effective prevention of dementia at a population&#xD;
      level will need to include lifestyle factors such as promoting higher levels of physical&#xD;
      activity. Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD) and&#xD;
      cognitive decline, but the mechanisms by which physical activity exerts its protective effect&#xD;
      on the brain remain unknown. Motivated by the need to develop strategies to prevent and treat&#xD;
      AD and related dementias (ADRD), the investigators' overall research goal is to discover why&#xD;
      the aging brain develops ADRD. To achieve this goal the investigators adopt a translational&#xD;
      physiology approach (i.e., study of physiology from molecule/cell to population) to&#xD;
      investigate how exercise improves cognitive performance, and the underlying mechanisms by&#xD;
      which exercise prevents and/or slows down age-related declines in brain health and cognition.&#xD;
      This approach allows the investigators to determine how physiological function is related to&#xD;
      ADRD, with important implications for health. The investigators' prior work demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant relationship between fitness, vascular regulation and cognition in older adults&#xD;
      free of overt disease. These findings have implications for vascular cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      ADRD, in which hypoperfusion and dysregulation of cerebral blood flow are thought to be&#xD;
      important pathophysiological factors. The investigators' central hypothesis is that regular&#xD;
      aerobic exercise mitigates age-related decreases in vascular function and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      reserve, which in turn benefits cognition. Work by the investigators and others has provided&#xD;
      the necessary data justifying a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the role of exercise&#xD;
      in the prevention of ADRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are well equipped to undertake this trial; the investigators have dedicated&#xD;
      institutional support and necessary expertise in vascular regulation, cognition, aging,&#xD;
      neuroimaging and genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this proposal is to test an exercise intervention for secondary&#xD;
      prevention of ADRD in adults between 50 and 80 years old who are at increased risk for ADRD&#xD;
      (with memory impairment symptoms but without dementia). The rationale for this trial is the&#xD;
      urgent need for dementia prevention: an exercise intervention, which harnesses a&#xD;
      translational physiology framework, holds such promise. The investigators will conduct this&#xD;
      trial to determine the effects of aerobic exercise on the development of age-associated&#xD;
      cognitive decline and dementia. The exercise intervention is designed with input from Alberta&#xD;
      Health Services, the universal healthcare provider for Albertans, so that the intervention&#xD;
      can be readily adopted into clinical practice if this trial is successful. The trial will&#xD;
      address three specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 1: Determine the independent effect of exercise on cognitive performance in&#xD;
      previously inactive older adults at increased risk of ADRD. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that participants randomized to our six-month aerobic exercise intervention will perform&#xD;
      better on cognitive tests, compared to control participants randomized to a stretching-toning&#xD;
      exercise group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine underlying biological mechanisms that influence cognitive&#xD;
      performance after exercise training. The investigators hypothesize that exercise improves&#xD;
      cognition due to changes at molecular/cellular (biomarkers), vascular (cerebral blood flow,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular reserve), anatomical and functional (neuroimaging), and behavioural (sleep&#xD;
      quality) levels. Further, the investigators hypothesize that ADRD-specific genetic risk&#xD;
      scores, reflective of targeted genetic variants, moderate exercise-related cognitive and&#xD;
      brain outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 3: Determine the extent to which changes in cognition, resting cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow and cerebrovascular reserve persist 12 months after participants complete a 6-month&#xD;
      exercise training intervention. The investigators hypothesize that the effects of improved&#xD;
      aerobic fitness will be maintained over time as a function of persistent lifestyle changes&#xD;
      and behavioural support programs. This trial will provide evidence needed to make clinical&#xD;
      recommendations for exercise programs in adults at risk for ADRD, with the goal of preventing&#xD;
      dementia. Given the investigators' extensive stakeholder input, this intervention will be&#xD;
      easily translated to other jurisdictions. This research into the mechanisms of effect for&#xD;
      exercise will identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit, surrogate outcome markers&#xD;
      for use in future trials to refine intervention dose/duration, and new therapeutic targets&#xD;
      for future interventions.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will take part in a supervised 6-month-long aerobic (walk/jog) training program held 3 days/week. Each session will include a 5-min warm-up, 20-40 min of aerobic exercise (walking, jogging), 5-min cool-down, and stretching. Exercise prescriptions will follow current principles and guidelines established by ACSM/AHA, including sufficient warm-up, cool-down, and ongoing provision of safety precautions/exercise tips. As participants progress, the duration of aerobic exercise will increase from 20 (month 1) to 30 (months 2-3) and 40 min (months 4-6), with proportional increases to warm-up and cool-down periods. Exercise intensity will be based on individual maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), measured at baseline. Intensity will build from 30-45% (months 1-3) to mitigate the risk of injury and will progress to 60-70% (months 4-6) heart rate reserve (HRR).</description>
