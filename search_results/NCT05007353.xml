    <textblock>
      A study in Finland found that a multidomain intervention of physical activity, nutritional&#xD;
      guidance, cognitive training, social activities and management of vascular risk factors&#xD;
      slowed cognitive decline in healthy older adults at increased risk of cognitive decline. A&#xD;
      6-month pilot study was initiated in Singapore, which demonstrated the cultural feasibility&#xD;
      and practicality of the FINGER interventions and a set of locally adapted interventions in an&#xD;
      Asian population. The SINGER study is a 2-year randomized controlled trial that aims to test&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of these lifestyle changes, including diet and cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factor management, cognitive and physical exercises, in delaying cognitive decline in older&#xD;
      adults at risk of dementia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Results from a population-based 2-year clinical trial, the Finnish Geriatric Intervention&#xD;
      Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), demonstrated that a&#xD;
      multidomain intervention of physical activity, nutritional guidance, cognitive training,&#xD;
      social activities and management of vascular risk factors slowed cognitive decline in healthy&#xD;
      older adults at increased risk of cognitive decline. Currently, no pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      options that can rival these effects. Thus, there is an urgent need to test the&#xD;
      generalizability, adaptability, and sustainability of these findings in Singaporean&#xD;
      populations. A 6-month pilot study was initiated in Singapore, which demonstrated the&#xD;
      cultural feasibility and practicality of the FINGER interventions and a set of locally&#xD;
      adapted interventions in an Asian population. Hence, the next step was to conduct a larger&#xD;
      scale SINGER trial to determine the efficacy of these interventions in Singapore. If the&#xD;
      interventions are found to be effective and safe with high applicability and scalability, the&#xD;
      study will provide important clinical and public health implications to a rapidly increasing&#xD;
      ageing population.&#xD;
