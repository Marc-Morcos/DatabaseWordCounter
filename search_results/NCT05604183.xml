      Two devices will be tested in this research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mantis Photonics' hyperspectral camera for non-invasive retinal examination (i.e., a&#xD;
           hardware medical device under investigation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blekinge CoGNIT cognitive ability test (i.e., an assessment).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, millions of people are affected by neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, dementia). Those diseases are having a tremendous socio-economic impact on our&#xD;
      society. The cost associated with treating and caring for those diseases is enormous.&#xD;
      Overwhelming evidence indicates how selective lifestyle changes (e.g., reducing exposure to&#xD;
      known risk factors) can sometimes significantly decrease the probability of developing the&#xD;
      disease or delay its onset. However, the diseases must be diagnosed early for them to be&#xD;
      effective. There is a lack of accessible, inexpensive, and non-invasive practices that would&#xD;
      allow for an early diagnosis of different diseases, even at the primary physician's office.&#xD;
      Mantis Photonics and Blekinge Tekniska Högskola (Institustionen för Hälsa) aim to fill this&#xD;
      urgent unmet medical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strong indications of the possibility of classifying Alzheimer's status based on&#xD;
      hyperspectral scans of the retina have been published by different researchers. These results&#xD;
      were obtained based on images taken with hyperspectral cameras with a different working&#xD;
      principle than the Mantis Photonics camera. The working principle of the Mantis Photonics&#xD;
      camera allows making a hyperspectral retinoscopy with the same spectral range and comparable&#xD;
      or better spectral resolution with a machine that is more modular and lower in cost. There is&#xD;
      thus reason to hypothesize retinal scans taken with the Mantis Photonics camera can be used&#xD;
      for the same classification task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies on the automated tablet computer cognitive test CoGNIT have established&#xD;
      validity, reliability and sensitivity for testing patients with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus&#xD;
      (NPH) . Recently feasibility of testing in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) was affirmed&#xD;
      (Behrens, Berglund, &amp; Anderberg, CoGNIT Automated Tablet Computer Cognitive Testing in&#xD;
      Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: Feasibility Study, 2022). In NPH patients, CoGNIT&#xD;
      was more sensitive to cognitive impairment at baseline and cognitive improvement after shunt&#xD;
      surgery than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests for amyloid-β and other biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease are being&#xD;
      investigated for clinical practice, but the technique is not accepted as a standard test.&#xD;
      Research has shown that renal function influences amyloid-β clearance from the body. Also,&#xD;
      analytical errors influence test results. Therefore, one can question the influence of normal&#xD;
      repeatability of the blood test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this investigation is the evaluation, (further) development and comparison of&#xD;
      non-invasive techniques for the evaluation of patients suffering mild cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      in particular, the Mantis Photonics hyperspectral camera with classification machine learning&#xD;
      model in combination with the CoGNIT test of Dr Behrens (Blekinge Tekniska Högskola). These&#xD;
      techniques will be compared to the result of cerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF), the&#xD;
      reference biological diagnostic technique for Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
