  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of Phase II of the NIH SBIR grant, the study will conduct a randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial in which the MapHabit system (MHS) will offer a caregiver training product&#xD;
      that is linked to MHS, an Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (AD/ADRD) assistive&#xD;
      technology product that uses visual maps to improve a patient's behavior and sense of&#xD;
      autonomy. MapHabit's combined areas of focus, i.e., offer a single integrated product to&#xD;
      address the caregiver and the person under this caregiver's care, are unique and will create&#xD;
      a new standard in the field to reduce caregiver burden in the setting of caring for&#xD;
      individuals with AD/ADRD. Additionally, the study will integrate enhanced user support&#xD;
      modules, i.e., gamifying, dashboarding, and social networking, to improve the Caregiver&#xD;
      Training Program (CTP) experience.The study will be a randomized controlled clinical trial,&#xD;
      in which two conditions will be investigated: 1) control condition in which the MHS alone is&#xD;
      incorporated in the participant's daily care and 2) experimental condition in which the&#xD;
      MHS+CTP is implemented into the daily care received by participants. The sample size will be&#xD;
      a total of 50 patient-caregiver dyads, 25 in each condition. The study duration will be a&#xD;
      6-month intervention.&#xD;

    <description>This condition will involve the implementation of an assistive technology software (named the MapHabit System) with an added Caregiver Training Program into the daily care of individuals with mild to moderate stages of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The MapHabit System (MHS) is a commercially available visual mapping software application that utilizes visual, audio, and text media to create step-by-step visual guides to assist individuals and their caregivers in structuring and accomplishing activities of daily living (ADLs). The application will be made available to families through compatible tablets.</description>

    <description>This control condition will act as the active comparator to the experimental condition. The same assistive technology, the MapHabit System, will be given to a separate group of participants. The difference here will be that the software will be a version that does not include the caregiver training program.</description>

    <description>The MapHabit System (MHS) is a commercially available visual mapping software application that utilizes visual, audio, and text media to create step-by-step visual guides to assist individuals and their caregivers in structuring and accomplishing activities of daily living (ADLs). The goal of the application is to develop and facilitate habits and routines using structured visual and auditory stimuli that can be customized by the user and can include educational and lesson-based material in addition to ADLs. The application will be made available to families through compatible smartphones and tablets. Depending on the condition, participants will receive a specific version of the application. The experimental condition will receive the version that incorporates gamified content and structure.&#xD;
The MHS is a general wellness product and there is no regulatory oversight of the MapHabit System mapping functionality. This functionality is not a regulated medical device.</description>
