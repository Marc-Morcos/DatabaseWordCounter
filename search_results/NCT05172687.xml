  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyze how warning letters sent to physicians prescribing high levels of&#xD;
      the antipsychotic quetiapine affected the health and quality of life of their patients with&#xD;
      dementia. Using a randomized controlled trial conducted by the Centers for Medicare and&#xD;
      Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2015, this secondary study looks at the effects of potential&#xD;
      de-prescribing of antipsychotics by study physicians induced by the letters. The central&#xD;
      question is whether the intervention led to better health and quality of life outcomes by&#xD;
      encouraging more guideline-concordant care and whether changes in physicians' prescription&#xD;
      behavior caused unintended harms.&#xD;

        Repeated cross sections of patients attributed to study prescribers. Analyses are conducted&#xD;
        separately for patients residing in nursing homes and patients living in the community. The&#xD;
        investigators look at a series of sequential 90 day periods with the first period beginning&#xD;
        at the start of the intervention. The investigators measure outcomes based on health care&#xD;
        assessments, encounters, and claims that occur during the period. The investigators&#xD;
        attribute patients to study prescribers based on their evaluation and management encounters&#xD;
        during the 90 days preceding the period for nursing home patients and during the 180 days&#xD;
        preceding the period for community-dwelling patients. The patient is attributed to the&#xD;
        physician who rendered the most of these services.&#xD;
