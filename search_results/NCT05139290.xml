  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to design and test a decision-making program that is tailored to&#xD;
      support adult daughters making healthcare decisions for their parents who are living with&#xD;
      memory loss to improve the quality of life of African American families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two phases of this research study. The first phase will collect information by&#xD;
      surveys and/or interviews. The surveys and interviews will ask questions about demographics&#xD;
      (e.g., age, race/ethnicity), culture, health, family dynamics, caregiving, and healthcare&#xD;
      experiences. The surveys will be completed by all eligible adult daughters and parents with&#xD;
      memory loss in pairs. The interviews will be completed by a smaller number of pairs and by&#xD;
      all former adult daughter caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general scope of topics is caregiving experiences, cultural identity, healthcare&#xD;
      decisions for persons living with Alzheimer's disease, and related dementias, health, and&#xD;
      well-being. The research team will identify and examine key factors that will lead to&#xD;
      designing and testing the feasibility of a culturally tailored prototype intervention for&#xD;
      African American dementia dyads/families of persons living with mild to moderate Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease and related dementias.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a survey/questionnaire and interview study that will examine how healthcare decisions&#xD;
      are made for African American parents living with memory loss by African American adult&#xD;
      daughter caregivers to develop a prototype intervention to improve how these decisions are&#xD;
      made and improve the quality of life of African American parents living with memory loss and&#xD;
      their African American adult daughter caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will occur through established connections at Emory University Goizueta&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Minority Engagement Core, Emory Healthcare Integrated&#xD;
      Memory Care Clinic, and Emory University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place in metro Atlanta and across the United States using a study flyer&#xD;
      and video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The flyer will include the phone number, email address of the research team, and a QR code&#xD;
      for potential participants to contact the research team. The video will give information&#xD;
      about the principal investigator (PI) and the research study as a strategy to build rapport&#xD;
      with potential participants and assuage distrust in research. Interviews will occur remotely&#xD;
      after participants have completed the screening process and are deemed eligible for the&#xD;
      study. This is not a no-contact study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will be de-identified. Privacy of existing data is not a concern. This&#xD;
      study has two phases. The first phase will consist of surveys/questionnaires and&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews via Zoom from both the parents living with memory loss and their&#xD;
      adult daughters as well as semi-structured interviews via Zoom of past adult daughter&#xD;
      caregivers whose parent(s) have died or are in long-term care facilities. For past adult&#xD;
      daughter caregivers whose parents have died, the parent will need to have died at least 12&#xD;
      months before enrolling in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of phase two (phase 2a), participants will be key informants who&#xD;
      participate in focus groups sessions using design thinking strategies to develop the&#xD;
      prototype intervention. Key informants will consist of parent-adult daughter dyads and past&#xD;
      adult daughter caregivers. In the last part of phase two (phase 2b), a pretest/posttest&#xD;
      design with two follow-ups will be completed by a new set of African American parent-adult&#xD;
      daughter dementia dyad participants. The interactions will include surveys/questionnaires and&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by computer/tablet and/or telephone. For participants with limited&#xD;
      access to a computer/tablet, the surveys may be completed via paper/pencil. The general scope&#xD;
      of topics is caregiving experiences, cultural identity, healthcare decisions for persons&#xD;
      living with Alzheimer's disease, and related dementias, health, and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase one, surveys/questionnaires for persons with mild to moderate dementia will take&#xD;
      0.67 hours and 1 hour for adult daughter caregivers. In phase one, the semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews will last 1 hour in total for both parent and daughter. Semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      with past adult daughter caregivers will last approximately 0.75 hours. In phase 2, key&#xD;
      informants will have three sessions that last approximately 1.5 hours to assist with the&#xD;
      development of the prototype intervention. In phase 2, the pretest/posttest&#xD;
      surveys/questionnaire should last 0.33 hours for parents living with dementia and 0.67 hours&#xD;
      for adult daughters at baseline and the 2 follow-ups. The last follow-up will consist of one&#xD;
      semi-structured interview that will last about 0.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 will allow collecting and analyzing the necessary data to develop the prototype&#xD;
      intervention that will be developed in phase 2a and used in phase 2b: the intervention phase.&#xD;
