      ALADDIN is a research study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of leuprolide (a&#xD;
      hormone drug) to improve the cognitive function and slow the progression of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD) in men 65 years and older with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who reside&#xD;
      in the community.&#xD;

      ALADDIN is a clinical trial investigating the safety and effectiveness of leuprolide (a&#xD;
      hormone drug) to improve the cognitive function and slow the progression of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD). The study will include treatment of men 65 years and older with mild to&#xD;
      moderate Alzheimer's disease who reside in the community. The objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of two different doses of leuprolide to improve the cognitive function&#xD;
      and slow the progression of AD, as measured by the ADAS-COG and the Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression (CGI). Measures of behavioral disturbances, and quality of life of the caregiver&#xD;
      will be made also. The study design is randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group design with a 2:1 randomization of drug to placebo. Sample size will include 90&#xD;
      participants from multiple test sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following initial screening and baseline visits, the participant and caregiver will visit the&#xD;
      site 8 times for a total of 10 visits over 48 weeks. The drug is administered via injection&#xD;
      every 3 months. Safety assessments are completed and psychometric testing is done.&#xD;
      Participant's memory, behavior, and global functioning are assessed during the participant&#xD;
      and caregiver interviews. Each visit takes approximately 2 hours.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient and responsible caregiver can give their consent by signing the IRB-approved&#xD;
             Informed Consent Form; or, when the patient is judged by the Investigator to be unable&#xD;
             to give consent, the legally authorized representative gives consent by signing the&#xD;
             consent form and the patient gives assent, in accord with local regulations;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  65 years of age or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of probable AD according to the National Institute of Neurological&#xD;
             Disorders-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINDS-ADRDA)&#xD;
             criteria, and the Investigator ascertains that the condition was present at least 6&#xD;
             months prior to screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking a drug for the treatment of AD, such as a cholinesterase inhibitor and/or&#xD;
             MemantineÂ®, which they began taking at least 90 days prior to baseline and, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, the dosage will likely remain stable throughout the trial; or,&#xD;
             they have never taken such a drug or stopped taking it at least 90 days prior to&#xD;
             baseline and will likely refrain from taking such treatment throughout the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking other drugs or substances that have purported cognition-enhancing properties&#xD;
             such as ginkgo biloba or Vitamin E, which they began taking at least 60 days prior to&#xD;
             baseline and, in the Investigator's opinion, the dosage will likely remain stable&#xD;
             throughout the trial; or, they have never taken such a drug or stopped taking it at&#xD;
             least 90 days prior to baseline and will likely refrain from taking such treatment&#xD;
             throughout the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 12 to 24 (inclusive) at the screening&#xD;
             visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain imaging study (CT scan, MRI or PET) performed at the time of their initial&#xD;
             diagnosis of AD or after that time, and the findings were consistent with a diagnosis&#xD;
             of probable AD, or, if a brain imaging study has not been performed, one will be&#xD;
             performed during the screening process;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rosen Modified Hachinski score of 4 or lower at the screening visit, supporting the&#xD;
             Investigator's clinical judgment that the patient's dementia is probable AD and not of&#xD;
             vascular origin;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fluent in English or Spanish and completed at least 6 years of education;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Live at home or in a congregate living facility for requirements other than skilled&#xD;
             nursing care, and have a caregiver who sees the patient at least three times a week&#xD;
             for a total of at least 10 hours and can sign the consent form, provide information&#xD;
             pertinent to the patient's cognitive status, accompany the patient on clinic visits,&#xD;
             and participate in the evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hamilton Depression Scale (17-item version) (HamD) score of 14 or less at the&#xD;
             screening visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DEXA scan, performed at screening, within normal limits (i.e., a T-score of greater&#xD;
             than -2.0); or, if their DEXA measure was abnormally low (i.e., a T-score of -2.0 or&#xD;
             lower), in either a lumbar vertebra or hip, to specifically include a T-score for the&#xD;
             femoral neck), they were receiving treatment for osteoporosis/osteopenia for at least&#xD;
             3 weeks prior to baseline and that treatment is not expected to change during the&#xD;
             course of the trial; or, if their DEXA measure was abnormally low and they are not&#xD;
             receiving treatment for osteoporosis/osteopenia, they may proceed to baseline after 3&#xD;
             weeks of treatment for osteoporosis/osteopenia provided that all inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
             criteria are met, including assessment of the HamD, concomitant medications, ECG and&#xD;
             laboratory tests performed within 45 days of baseline show that they are eligible;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening laboratory test values do not indicate significant medical conditions that&#xD;
             would interfere with their participation in and completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any of the exclusion criteria listed below will be ineligible for entry into&#xD;
        the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Younger than 65 years of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant neurological disease affecting the brain or psychiatric disease other than&#xD;
             AD, such as major depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, or stroke;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current significant systemic illness or symptoms of organ failure;&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Receiving testosterone;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking a drug for the treatment of AD for less than 90 days prior to baseline; or, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Investigator, they are likely to either require a change in dose or&#xD;
             discontinuation of the drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Never received cholinesterase inhibitor treatment, and the likelihood of their&#xD;
             starting such treatment during the study is other than low, or they have taken and&#xD;
             discontinued cholinesterase inhibitor treatment in the past and the likelihood of&#xD;
             their resuming cholinesterase inhibitor treatment during the study is other than low;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Started or changed within 60 days prior to the screening visit the dosage of any drug&#xD;
             (including OTC) that affects cognitive function, such as neuroleptics,&#xD;
             antidepressants, anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics, anti-convulsants, centrally acting&#xD;
             antihypertensive agents such as clonidine and Aldomet; or other medications that have&#xD;
             been shown to have possible effects on cognition such as Vitamin E, nonsteroidal&#xD;
             anti-inflammatory drugs, and statins, or if, in the Investigator's opinion, the dosage&#xD;
             of such medication is likely to be changed during the course of this trial. Any&#xD;
             changes in the dosage of any of these drugs during the course of the trial and the&#xD;
             reason for the change must be fully recorded in the concomitant medication page of the&#xD;
             patient's case report form (CRF). If a drug that affects cognition (e.g., a hypnotic&#xD;
             or anxiolytic drug) is given on a PRN basis, such treatment should be interrupted for&#xD;
             12 hours before a visit, if possible;&#xD;

             within the last 5 years, except for basal cell or squamous cell cancer of the skin;&#xD;
