    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn about inflammation in the brain of those with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD). The purpose of this study is to determine if 11C-ER176 is able to accurately&#xD;
      measure inflammation in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Both patients (with either mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease) and healthy controls (participants without&#xD;
      memory complaints or impairment) will be included in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation likely plays a role in the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurately measuring inflammation in the brain could provide new information about the&#xD;
      mechanisms that cause Alzheimer's disease, and could help identify new treatments that reduce&#xD;
      inflammation. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a type of brain scanning method&#xD;
      that allows investigators to measure small molecules in the brain. ER176-PET was recently&#xD;
      developed as an improved method for measuring brain inflammation. However, ER176-PET has not&#xD;
      yet been used in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The investigators propose to use&#xD;
      ER176-PET imaging in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (a very early stage of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease) or mild Alzheimer's disease to compare the amount of inflammation with&#xD;
      that seen in older control subjects. The investigators will first use a &quot;gold standard&quot;&#xD;
      method of measuring ER176 in brain that requires sampling arterial blood during the scan. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare these results to those obtained using novel methods that don't&#xD;
      require blood sampling. The investigators hope to show that ER176 is a useful tool for&#xD;
      measuring inflammation in Alzheimer's disease, and that the investigators can develop a way&#xD;
      to obtain ER176 PET scans that don't require arterial blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses a special type of scan called a PET scan to take pictures of the brain.&#xD;
      During the PET scan, a special dye is injected into the body. Two types of dye will be used&#xD;
      in this study: Florbetaben and 11C-ER176. Florbetaben sticks to amyloid plaques, which are in&#xD;
      the brain in Alzheimer's disease. Florbetaben has been approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease. 11C-ER176 sticks to parts of the brain&#xD;
      where there is inflammation. Past studies have shown that inflammation is present in the&#xD;
      brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
