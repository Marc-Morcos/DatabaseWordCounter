  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, observational, feasibility study, to evaluate long term passive data&#xD;
      collection, data quality, and user experience of HealthMode Agitation (Apps) to collect&#xD;
      motion, location, physiological, and audio data; and eCOA and EMA responses with mobile&#xD;
      devices (iPhone, Apple Watch).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and improve HealthMode Apps data collection and&#xD;
      usability in subjects experiencing agitation in the context of dementia.&#xD;
