      The main objective of this non-interventional study was to document the long-term application&#xD;
      of galantamine and nootropics (memory enhancing drugs) over a period of 1 year under&#xD;
      conditions of daily routine. There were no predefined specifications of diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic measures. The decision for treatment with either galantamine or a nootropic had&#xD;
      to be made by the treating physician prior to the start of documentation. The following&#xD;
      measures were to be documented: safety, tolerability, dementia-associated symptoms (unstable&#xD;
      walking, vertigo, awakening at night, shouting/screaming at night, perambulating at night,&#xD;
      aggressiveness, agitation, apathy/social retreat, delusions, hallucinations, behavior that&#xD;
      poses a risk to self or others, and daytime tiredness), frequency of admissions to nursing&#xD;
      homes or nursing services, global functional level, caregiver's burden, and time spent on&#xD;
      caregiving. Furthermore, this study aimed to gather knowledge on the differentiated use of&#xD;
      the two treatment strategies considering the specific diagnosis of dementia (e.g. Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease only or mixed dementia, i.e. Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease) and&#xD;
      risk profiles.&#xD;

      The aim of this observational, non-interventional study was to observe and document for a&#xD;
      1-year period, the long-term use of galantamine and nootropics (memory enhancing drugs) over&#xD;
      a 1 year period under conditions of daily routine in a typical patient population of patients&#xD;
      with mild or moderate Alzheimer's dementia or with mixed dementia, i.e. Alzheimer's and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease. The design of this prospective study was non-interventional and&#xD;
      thus, there were no predefined specifications of diagnostic and therapeutic measures. The&#xD;
      decision for treatment with either galantamine or a nootropic agent had to be made by the&#xD;
      treating physician prior to the start of documentation. Patients were observed over a period&#xD;
      of 12 months or until end of documentation (visit 1 = baseline; visit 2, 3 and 4 after&#xD;
      approximately 2, 6 and 9 months, respectively; visit 5 after approximately 12 months or final&#xD;
      visit at end of documentation). The following measures were to be documented: safety by&#xD;
      documenting adverse and serious adverse events together with severity, outcome and causality&#xD;
      to the treatment; tolerability; vital functions; Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) staging&#xD;
      system assessing global functioning; Mini-Mental State Examination assessing cognitive&#xD;
      functions; dementia-associated behavioural symptoms (unstable walking, vertigo, awakening at&#xD;
      night, shouting/screaming at night, perambulating at night, aggressiveness, agitation,&#xD;
      apathy/social retreat, delusions, hallucinations, behavior that poses a risk to self or&#xD;
      others, and daytime tiredness); frequency of admissions to nursing homes or nursing services;&#xD;
      caregiver's burden and time spent on caregiving (based on daily and weekly caregiving tasks);&#xD;
      final evaluation of the therapy with galantamine or nootropics through the treating&#xD;
      physician. Furthermore, this study aimed to gather knowledge on the differentiated use of the&#xD;
      two treatment strategies considering the specific diagnosis of dementia (e.g. Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease only or mixed dementia, i.e. Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease) and&#xD;
      risk profiles. Therapeutic measures were not predefined in the protocol but remained at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician. Therapy decisions were to be based on medical needs.&#xD;
      The treatment regimen of galantamine (8 mg,16 mg, 24 mg retard capsule) or nootropic agents&#xD;
      (e.g. ginkgo biloba, dihydroergotoxine, nicergoline, piracetam, or others) was to be in&#xD;
      accordance with the recommendations given in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC).&#xD;

             either galantamine or a nootropic had to be made by the treating physician prior to&#xD;
             the start of documentation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient had a caregiver to whom personal contact was possible at least 3 times per&#xD;
             week&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients were not eligible if they had received anti-dementive treatment with&#xD;
