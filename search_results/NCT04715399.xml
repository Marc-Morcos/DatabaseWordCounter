  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to create a repository of both cross-sectional and longitudinal&#xD;
      data, including cognitive, linguistic, imaging and biofluid biological specimens, for&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disease research and treatment.&#xD;

      The Principal Investigator (PI) at the University of Pennsylvania seeks to better understand&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases and is continually expanding research efforts and collaborations&#xD;
      regarding the factors which may contribute to these illnesses. Investigators seek to better&#xD;
      understand the basis of neurodegenerative conditions by creating a multimodal repository,&#xD;
      including: clinical data such as demographic characteristics, vital signs and motor scales;&#xD;
      cognitive and speech data; neuroimaging data; and biological specimens with associated&#xD;
      biofluid biomarkers and genetic data. Investigators pursue acquiring these data from&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disease patients, people at risk for neurodegenerative disease due to a&#xD;
      family history, and unaffected adults. Targeted conditions include frontotemporal&#xD;
      degeneration (FTD), primary progressive aphasia PPA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),&#xD;
      progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), familial frontotemporal&#xD;
      lobar degeneration (fFTLD), non-amnestic variants of Alzheimer's disease including logopenic&#xD;
      progressive aphasia and posterior cortical atrophy, and Lewy body disease. This study aims to&#xD;
      collect clinical and cognitive data, imaging data, and biospecimen samples from people whose&#xD;
      background can inform research and treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and make these&#xD;
      samples and data available to qualified researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and&#xD;
      collaborating academic centers and industry partners.&#xD;

        To better understand neurodegenerative diseases, the investigators will include people&#xD;
        living with these illnesses, people at risk of developing these illnesses, and people&#xD;
        without neurodegenerative disease who wish to contribute to science as controls.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This protocol will include 3 groups of people:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. People with a clinical diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disease. such as&#xD;
             frontotemporal degeneration(FTD), primary progressive aphasia(PPA), Lewy body&#xD;
             disease(LBD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS), progressive supranuclear palsy(PSP),&#xD;
             corticobasal syndrome(CBS), posterior cortical atrophy(PCA), Alzheimer's disease(AD),&#xD;
             Parkinson's disease(PD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. People with a family history of neurodegenerative disease who may or may not be&#xD;
             symptomatic, and may or may not be mutation carriers such as familial frontotemporal&#xD;
             lobar degeneration (fFTLD) or familial ALS,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. People with no known neurological disease who will provide control data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone who is under the age of 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone with a condition or in a situation which, in the Investigator's opinion, could&#xD;
             confound the study findings or may interfere significantly with a person's&#xD;
             participation, including but not limited to neurological, psychological and other&#xD;
             medical conditions (such as cardiac, neurosurgical, infectious conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individual participants may be excluded from some, but not all, study procedures for&#xD;
             safety reasons when they have a contraindication or at the discretion of the&#xD;
             Investigator. For example, persons with metal implants which are not MRI-safe will not&#xD;
             be able to take part in imaging, and those on blood thinning medications may not be&#xD;
             able to take part in lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women; if a woman becomes pregnant during the study, research activities that&#xD;
             may increase risk to the patient and the unborn fetus will be stopped until the end of&#xD;
             pregnancy, at which point participation can be resumed.&#xD;
