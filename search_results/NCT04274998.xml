  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to learn more about inflammation in the brain using&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging in people with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease/Mild Cognitive Impairment or healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject agrees to be in this study, she/ he will have a PET/CT scan using the&#xD;
      investigational radiotracer [18F]NOS. A subject with a specific genetic polymorphism may also&#xD;
      agree to be in the sub-study in which she/he will have another PET/CT scan using the&#xD;
      investigational tracer [11C]PBR28 for comparison with the FNOS [18F]NOS scan. For subjects&#xD;
      who agree to this sub-study they may undergo the brain PET/CT scan with [11C]PBR28 either on&#xD;
      the same day as the [18F]NOS PET/CT or on another day. The subject may have a screening visit&#xD;
      before the PET/CT scan visit if the investigator needs to confirm the subject is able to be&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be taken before the scans. Additional blood samples will be taken during&#xD;
      the PET scans. Subjects must also agree to have an MRI scan for this research study if she/he&#xD;
      has not had a recent scan that the study doctor decides can be used for this study.&#xD;
