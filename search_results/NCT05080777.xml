      This cluster randomized pragmatic clinical trial will test the effectiveness and feasibility&#xD;
      of embedding the Tele-Savvy intervention, a psychoeducational program for family and other&#xD;
      informal caregivers of older adults living in the community with Alzheimer's disease and&#xD;
      related dementia (ADRD), in two health care systems/clinical sites: UConn Health in&#xD;
      Farmington, Connecticut, and Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia.&#xD;

      This cluster randomized pragmatic clinical trial will test the effectiveness and feasibility&#xD;
      of embedding the Tele-Savvy intervention, a psychoeducational program for family and other&#xD;
      informal caregivers of older adults living in the community with Alzheimer's disease and&#xD;
      related dementia (ADRD), in two health care systems/clinical sites: UConn Health in&#xD;
      Farmington, Connecticut, and Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia. A total of 100 caregivers,&#xD;
      50 at each study site, will participate in this pilot study. At each site, 30 caregivers will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive the Tele-Savvy intervention, and 20 caregivers will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive the self-guided Caregiving During Crisis online program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 100 caregivers will complete identical self-administered questionnaires to measure the&#xD;
      caregiver-specific outcome measures in this pilot study. Outcome measures will include&#xD;
      caregiver mastery (primary outcome), caregiver response to specific memory and behavioral&#xD;
      problems, and caregiver stress. Also, we will employ process measures of participation and&#xD;
      engagement in the interventions for caregivers in both arms of the trial, as well as&#xD;
      implementation outcomes via surveys with clinicians and Information Technology staff at each&#xD;
      of the two clinical sites responsible for programming electronic medical records to enable&#xD;
      capture and storage of caregiver outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Three Tele-Savvy programs, with 10 caregivers in each Tele-Savvy program cohort, will be held sequentially at each health care system site, for a total of 60 caregivers in 6 Tele-Savvy cohorts. Recruitment will occur in three waves, whereby caregivers will be randomly assigned at a 3:2 ratio to either Tele-Savvy or the attention control group until the first Tele-Savvy cohort is filled (first wave), followed by the same randomization procedure until the second and third Tele-Savvy cohorts are filled.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The reactions caregivers have to the behavioral and psychological symptoms expressed by persons living with dementia, using the Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMBPC). The RMBPC is a 24-item scale capturing caregiver reactions to 24 memory and behavior problems. Scores are computed based on the presence or absence of each problem first, and then for caregiver &quot;reaction&quot; or the extent to which caregivers were &quot;bothered&quot; or &quot;upset&quot; by each behavior.</description>

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) will be used to quantify caregiver stress levels. The PSS is a 14-item measure. Higher score reflects higher perceived stress</description>

    <description>A low-risk, psychoeducational, group-based intervention, is grounded in social learning and stress process theory and its main goal is to produce improved caregiver mastery over the symptom management skills commonly encountered when supervising and caring at home for an older adult living with ADRD. Over the 7-week program, there are synchronous and asynchronous activities each week. The synchronous portion includes weekly scheduled videoconferences (60-80 min) that serve as an online classroom in which facilitators lead lectures and discussions. Daily, caregivers access online 6- to 15-min prerecorded videos, each focused on one main learning objective. Caregivers can watch the lessons whenever and as often as they wish.</description>

    <intervention_name>Caregiving During Crisis (Educational Program)</intervention_name>
    <description>The attention control group will receive the self-guided Caregiving During Crisis program. Caregiving During Crisis is a fully online, asynchronous, professionally designed continuing education course aimed at developing the competency of informal caregivers of community-dwelling persons living with dementia to ensure the safety of that person and themselves during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The course, readily accessible by home computer or smartphone, describes methods of home infection control and prevention to create a Safe Home space, strategies for safely leaving and re-entering the home (e.g., to shop), additional strategies for safely allowing service personnel (e.g., home health aides or electricians) and select family members to enter the Safe Home space, and risk management strategies to frame decisions when/if COVID restrictions are relaxed or revoked.</description>
