    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Study is to identify the genes that are&#xD;
      responsible for causing Alzheimer's Disease (AD). One of the ways in which the risk factor&#xD;
      genes for late onset AD can be investigated is by identifying and collecting genetic material&#xD;
      from families with multiple members diagnosed with AD or dementia.&#xD;

      The purpose of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Study is to help identify the genes that may&#xD;
      be responsible for causing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by collecting genetic material from&#xD;
      families with multiple members diagnosed with AD. Qualifying families will have two living&#xD;
      blood-related individuals who have been diagnosed with or are showing symptoms of AD or&#xD;
      dementia. Local study sites are located all over the United States, and arrangements may be&#xD;
      made for eligible families who do not live near a participating site. The biological samples&#xD;
      and data from these families will be made available to qualified researchers, who must sign a&#xD;
      Materials Transfer Agreement (MTA) in order to protect the privacy rights of study&#xD;
      participants before receiving samples and data.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two living family members diagnosed with AD or other dementia with any age of onset&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biological samples available&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fresh blood, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Immortalized lymphoblastic cell lines, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  3-5 grams of frozen cerebral cortex; fixed samples are not accepted&#xD;
&#xD;
        Please note: this study does not include genetic counseling; because no personal&#xD;
        identifying information such as name or date of birth is attached to samples, results of&#xD;
        individual tests are not available to participants or family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Does not meet inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Member of a family that was included in the National Institute of Mental Health AD&#xD;
