  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the insulin-sensitizing medication&#xD;
      rosiglitazone on attention and memory skills in older adults with mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (MCI). The study also will examine the effects of this medication on brain structures that&#xD;
      support memory and other thinking abilities, and on biological markers associated with&#xD;
      inflammation, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will examine the effects of the insulin-sensitizing agent rosiglitazone on learning&#xD;
      and memory for 120 patients diagnosed with MCI. Participants will be randomized to an&#xD;
      18-month trial of rosiglitazone or placebo, followed by a 2-month washout period. At&#xD;
      screening and at treatment month 18, all participants will undergo an oral glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test (OGTT) to estimate pre- and post- treatment insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell function.&#xD;
      Cognitive measures and blood samples for biochemical assays will be obtained at baseline,&#xD;
      treatment months 6, 12, and 18, and washout (two months after completing treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, participants will have safety labs drawn and receive physical assessment of&#xD;
      any adverse events, changes in health status, or changes in medication; initially these&#xD;
      visits will be done at weeks 2 and 4, and then every three months. For months in which a&#xD;
      safety visit is not scheduled, telephone monitoring to assess any health concerns will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants enrolled in the primary study will be approached to participate in an MRI&#xD;
      substudy; patients will undergo serial brain MRI before treatment and following 18 months of&#xD;
      rosiglitazone or placebo, using three-dimensional T1-weighted images. Comparison of MCI&#xD;
      patients receiving rosiglitazone and placebo will be conducted to determine whether the rate&#xD;
      of medial temporal lobe (MTL) and whole brain atrophy is altered following treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MCI diagnosis: Participants will be diagnosed with MCI by consensus of a team of&#xD;
             physicians and neuropsychologists experienced in the diagnosis of MCI, using the&#xD;
             Petersen (Petersen, 1999, 2001) criteria for amnestic MCI or multiple domain MCI with&#xD;
             amnestic features: a) the presence of subjective memory complaints, evaluated via&#xD;
             detailed patient history and informant interview, b) objective verification of memory&#xD;
             impairment as measured by neuropsychological tests, c) normal general cognitive&#xD;
             function, d) intact or only mildly impaired activities of daily living, and e) absence&#xD;
             of dementia per NINCDS/ADRDA and/or DSM-IV criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following exclusion criteria will be used, based on initial physical examination,&#xD;
        medical history, lab work, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of diabetes or other relevant glucoregulatory disorders&#xD;
&#xD;

             beats per minute (dependent upon the individual's general health); any previously&#xD;
             unrecognized arrhythmia requiring further intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant peripheral edema at the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant medical illness or organ failure, including but not limited to renal&#xD;
             disease, hepatic disease, and unstable cardiac disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular current use of antipsychotic, anticonvulsive, anxiolytic, or sedative&#xD;
             medications; antidepressant medications are not exclusionary, provided the individual&#xD;
             does not have current major depression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A current diagnosis of major depression or other significant psychiatric comorbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant anemia at the time of screening&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Fasting glucose 125 or greater, or two-hour glucose value greater than 199 during the&#xD;
             OGTT; participants will be notified if their fasting blood sugar (monitored every 3&#xD;
             months) exceeds 125, and they will be withdrawn from further participation if their&#xD;
             fasting blood sugar exceeds 125 for two consecutive months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the MRI substudy, additional exclusion criteria include 1) previous exposure to&#xD;
             work involving the cutting or grinding of metal, 2) the presence of a pacemaker,&#xD;
             aneurysm clip, or other implanted metal device that would prohibit MRI procedures, and&#xD;
             3) significant history of claustrophobia&#xD;
