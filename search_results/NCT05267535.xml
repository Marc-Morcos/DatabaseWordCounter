      Randomized efficacy and safety study of piromelatine 20 mg versus placebo in participants&#xD;
      with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) who are 2:107,510,000-107,540,000&#xD;
      polymorphism non-carriers with the primary objective to compare the effect of piromelatine to&#xD;
      that of placebo on the AD Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog14) at Week 26 of&#xD;
      double-blind treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study of piromelatine 20 mg versus placebo in participants with mild dementia due to&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease is conducted as a confirmatory, randomized efficacy and safety study in&#xD;
      participants who are 2:107,510,000-107,540,000 polymorphism non-carriers (N=225).&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to receive either piromelatine 20&#xD;
      mg or placebo for 26 weeks. Medication is to be administered orally, one tablet daily, taken&#xD;
      1-2 hours before going to bed (preferably between 2100h and 2200h) and after food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To differentiate between symptomatic effects and potential disease modifying effects of&#xD;
      piromelatine, there will be a delayed-start open-label extension period of 12 months&#xD;
      treatment wherein placebo-treated participants will be treated with piromelatine (20 mg&#xD;
      daily) and the piromelatine-treated patients will be continued. This exploratory phase is&#xD;
      aimed to continue randomized assignment of piromelatine treatment, long-term (18 months&#xD;
      overall) to evaluate its potential disease modifying effect compared to patients in the&#xD;
      placebo-randomized group who started the treatment after a 6-month delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy analysis (blinded) is planned after completion of the 26 weeks double&#xD;
      blind period. If efficacy is not confirmed, then the study will be ended without completing&#xD;
      the extension period&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog 14)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAS was designed to measure the severity of the most important symptoms of AD. . It consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis, attention, and other cognitive abilities that are often referred to as the core symptoms of AD. The test comprises 11 items summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating less severe impairment. A negative change indicates an improvement from baseline. The addition of delayed recall, number cancelation, and maze tasks - and thus turning ADAS cog into a 12 , 13 , and 14 item scale respectively - has increased the ability to detect changes in patients in the early stages of the disease .</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-iADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The entire ADCS-ADL scale will be administered, however only the instrumental activities of daily living items (items 7 to 23) will be analyzed. The iADLs are thought to be more affected as the disease progresses. The range for the iADL score is 0 to 56, with lower scores indicating greater disease severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ADCS-Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS CGIC is a systematic method for assessing clinically significant change in a clinical trial as viewed by an independent skilled and experienced clinician. The ADCS CGIC focuses on clinicians' observations of change in the patient's cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of a trial.The ADCS CGIC requires the assessor to consider a number of cognitive, functional, and behavioral areas prior to providing an overall &quot;global&quot; assessment of clinical change (Schneider, Olin et al. 1997, Schneider, Clark et al. 2006). The ADCS CGIC assessor must be blinded to all other data for the patient after Visit 2.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a brief assessment instrument used to assess cognitive function in elderly patients. The MMSE can be used to screen for cognitive impairment and as a measurement of cognition over time and with pharmacologic treatment. The instrument is divided into 2 sections. The first section measures orientation, memory, and attention: the maximum score is 21. The second section tests the ability of the patient to name objects, follow verbal and written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures: the maximum score is 9. The scoring range for the MMSE is 0 30. A positive change indicates an improvement from baseline</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Safety - descriptive statistics for Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks, 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that first occur or worsen in severity after the first administration of study medications. The number of patients reporting TEAEs will be summarized during the 28 week treatment period and during the 52 weeks extension period by system organ class and preferred term for each treatment group. The number of patients withdrawing during the 28 week treatment period and during the 52 weeks extension period will be summarized by primary reason for withdrawal for each treatment group.</description>
