  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the impact of an Internet-delivered cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention on sleep and the extent to which it&#xD;
      contributes to cognitive health in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Participants&#xD;
      with insomnia who meet the study criteria for mild cognitive impairment will be recruited to&#xD;
      determine the effects of the CBT-I intervention compared to a patient education condition on&#xD;
      sleep and cognition. Internet-based recruitment methods will be used, and outcomes include&#xD;
      sleep variables, daytime variables, and cognitive status.&#xD;

      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the impact of an Internet-delivered cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention on sleep and the extent to which it&#xD;
      contributes to cognitive health in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Participants&#xD;
      with insomnia who meet the study criteria for mild cognitive impairment will be recruited to&#xD;
      determine the effects of the CBT-I intervention compared to patient education (PE) control&#xD;
      condition on sleep and cognition. Internet-based recruitment methods will be used, and&#xD;
      outcomes include sleep variables (reduced overall insomnia severity and wake after sleep&#xD;
      onset), daytime variables (reduced levels of fatigue, improved quality of life, and improved&#xD;
      mood), and cognitive status (memory, attention/psychomotor speed, and executive functioning&#xD;
      domains). After the pre-assessment battery is complete, participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      either the Internet-based PE or CBT-I intervention. At the start of week nine, all&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to complete the post-assessment battery and two weeks of&#xD;
      sleep diaries. After completing the post-assessment battery and sleep diaries, participants&#xD;
      will have continued access to their assigned online program throughout the study duration.&#xD;
      This same assessment (questionnaires + diaries) will be completed at 6, 12, 18, and 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be assigned to the SHUTi (Sleep Healthy Using the Internet) for Older Adult Sufferers of Insomnia and Sleeplessness (OASIS) online intervention optimized for older adults. CBTi will be delivered online and metered out over time with each new core becoming available one week after the completion of the previous core. The intervention period is 9 weeks. They will spend 1-2 hours during the intervention period completing daily sleep diaries as well as interactive core content covering topics of sleep behaviors, sleep thoughts, sleep education, and relapse prevention targeting issues specific to older adults. As users progress through the intervention, they will receive automated, tailored instructions on how to improve their sleep.</description>
