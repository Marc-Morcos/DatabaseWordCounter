  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 66 million informal caregivers care for someone who is ill, disabled, or aged.&#xD;
      These caregivers experience significant distress associated with caregiving, which may be&#xD;
      particularly salient in the context of inherited conditions. Previous studies have not&#xD;
      examined caregiving from a network perspective, nor have they considered how cognitive and&#xD;
      emotional responses, such as caregivers worry for themselves and relatives acquiring the&#xD;
      disease or guilt related to the genetic etiology of their child s illness, as possible&#xD;
      stressors; the current project fills this literature gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregiving processes may vary across type of illness and the life course. In illnesses that&#xD;
      impact children, parents and grandparents may take on caregiving roles whereas in conditions&#xD;
      that impact adults, spouses and adult children may provide care. Caregivers must adapt to the&#xD;
      strain of caring for their affected relatives and this adaptation may differ depending on&#xD;
      caregiver roles. The caregiver s support network may influence adaptation, impacting the&#xD;
      health and well-being of patients, their caregivers, and other relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project, comprised of 5 substudies, will examine social contexts surrounding families&#xD;
      involved in caring for individuals with chronic inherited conditions from a relational&#xD;
      perspective. Surveys and interviews will assess participants cognitions and emotions about&#xD;
      the disease, caregiving burden and caregiving/support network systems. In addition,&#xD;
      biomarkers will be considered in 2 substudies to examine how caregiving roles and&#xD;
      expectations impact health among caregivers. As part of our current inquiry, we have&#xD;
&#xD;
      developed an assessment tool aimed at understanding caregiver experiences related to dietary&#xD;
      practices in the context of metabolic conditions. To evaluate the psychometric properties of&#xD;
      this scale, we propose a fifth substudy under the current protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to recruit at least 5550 participants through residential/daycare centers, advocacy&#xD;
      groups, and the NIH Clinical Center. We will recruit formal caregivers, multiple biological&#xD;
      and non-biological adult relatives of affected individuals and typically developing controls&#xD;
      to construct and evaluate caregiving/support network systems. This project will use a social&#xD;
      network framework to develop and adapt common measures of caregiving roles to evaluate&#xD;
      burden, perceptual bias, and unmet expectations in caregiving. The psychometric properties of&#xD;
      these new measures, characteristics of family caregiving and support networks, and how these&#xD;
      network characteristics are associated with caregiving strain and well-being, including&#xD;
      biomarkers of physical health, will be investigated. The moderating role of family members&#xD;
      cognitions and emotions and disease context will be considered. Findings will guide future&#xD;
      research to develop network-based interventions promoting positive adaptation to the presence&#xD;
      of inherited conditions in families through improved social environments and coping skills.&#xD;

        This is a study has family-based enrollment of caregivers and their social support&#xD;
        networks. Specific context of recruitment may vary depending upon the health condition of&#xD;
        the affected family member; number of severe, chronic conditions with genetic basis are&#xD;
        among the inclusion criteria. For the substudy of caregivers of persons affected by&#xD;
        Alzheimer s disease and related dementias (AD), recruitment took place in residential&#xD;
        facilities in Memphis, TN [substudy1; data analysis only]. Caregivers of persons affected&#xD;
        by inborn errors of metabolism, genetic neurodegenerative conditions, or with severe&#xD;
        chronic undiagnosed conditions may be referred in to the protocol by NIH collaborators or&#xD;
        through advocacy groups. Healthy volunteers (parents of healthy child/ren) are recruited&#xD;
        through NIH and in the community. The study uses snowball sampling of self-referral: each&#xD;
        participant is invited to refer in support network members who also provide support/care&#xD;
        for the focus-relative.&#xD;
