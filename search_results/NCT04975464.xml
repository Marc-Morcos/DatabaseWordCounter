      In this study, the investigators will be looking at results of tests of memory and thinking&#xD;
      and daily activities in a group of people without known chronic kidney disease (CKD) , and a&#xD;
      group of CKD patients, and follow the participants for up to four more years, including after&#xD;
      the participants start dialysis or receive a transplant. The investigators are doing this&#xD;
      study to compare how often memory loss, confusion and difficulty with daily activities occur&#xD;
      in those without and those with CKD. Additionally, the investigators are doing this study to&#xD;
      identify risk factors for memory and thinking problems in CKD patients. The information&#xD;
      received through the NDI will be utilized to help track our study population and help provide&#xD;
      useful information regarding cause of death of those in our study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment (CI) in patients with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) is&#xD;
      common, affecting more than five million older people with moderate to severe CKD (estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate-eGFR &lt; 45). Both lower eGFR and increased albuminuria, a marker of&#xD;
      systemic vascular endothelial function, are associated with increased dementia risk and&#xD;
      structural MRI changes. Stroke prevalence is four times higher in advanced CKD than in&#xD;
      non-CKD, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and cerebral atrophy are increased.&#xD;
      Yet, the natural history, contributing factors, and brain abnormalities associated with&#xD;
      cognitive decline in CKD are poorly understood. In addition, previous studies of CI in CKDthe&#xD;
      investigators such as ADNI primarily included patients with mild CKD and lower risk of CI,&#xD;
      and few have included longitudinal measures of CI. To fill these gaps, our multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team (geriatrics, neurology, nephrology, neuroimaging) initiated the longitudinal BRain IN&#xD;
      Kidney (BRINK) disease study. The investigators assembled a unique cohort of 433 CKD patients&#xD;
      (~20% mild-moderate; 35% advanced; 45% severe; eGFR &lt; 30), with mean eGFR of 34, and 141&#xD;
      non-CKD (eGFR ≥ 60) controls, followed the participants for a median of 2.5 years, and&#xD;
      obtained baseline brain MRI, serial cognitive testing, and serum and urine biomarkers. Our&#xD;
      primary goal is to extend BRINK and obtain three and five year brain MRIs to characterize&#xD;
      cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular-related MRI brain changes over&#xD;
      five years. The investigators propose that CKD and its brain sequelae represent a model of&#xD;
      accelerated cerebrovascular disease and brain aging, with high rates of hypertension (&gt; 90%),&#xD;
      diabetes (50%), inflammation, and oxidative stress-all factors known to contribute to both&#xD;
      vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease-driving parallel trajectories of microvascular&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction in the kidney and brain and secondary neurodegeneration. Our&#xD;
      preliminary data demonstrate that at baseline those with eGFR &lt; 30 compared to eGFR ≥ 30 were&#xD;
      almost twice as likely to have moderate-severe CI, and delayed memory was most affected, as&#xD;
      seen in Alzheimer's disease. On brain MRI, the participants also had more strokes, WMH, and&#xD;
      worse white matter integrity. In addition, the investigators found that the common&#xD;
      CKD-related factors of elevated serum phosphorus and low hemoglobin were associated with&#xD;
      worse cognitive function and more severe abnormalities on brain MRI. Our cross-sectional MRI&#xD;
      findings support a cerebrovascular basis for CI in CKD, accelerated by CKD-related factors,&#xD;
      together driving neurodegenerative changes that may serve as a proximate correlate of CI in&#xD;
      CKD. Driven by our initial findings, the investigators seek to extend BRINK to define the&#xD;
      relation between CKD severity and worsening MRI changes and cognitive decline, and the&#xD;
      relation between the two. In addition, as the COVID pandemic has accelerated within the US&#xD;
      with associated cerebrovascular, cognitive and CKD outcomes, the investigators will leverage&#xD;
      this period to examine the effects of COVID diagnosis, symptoms and outcomes on cognitive&#xD;
      decline and CKD progression. The investigators will measure these associations using a new&#xD;
      COVID survey modeled after the COVID Symptom Tracker from Harvard. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators propose the following longitudinal aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS (Note: all models will be adjusted for time-varying and time-invariant&#xD;
      covariates) Aim 1 (total cohort): Characterize longitudinal changes in level of global&#xD;
      cognitive function and cognitive domains over a mean of five years by eGFR level and examine&#xD;
      COVID - 19 exposure as potential interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses 1: Those with eGFR &lt; 30 will be at greater risk of developing moderate/severe CI&#xD;
      and decline in cognitive domain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a (CKD only): Estimate the associations between change in CKD-related factors and change&#xD;
      in cognitive function in CKD over a mean of five years. Hypothesis 1a: Worsening CKD-related&#xD;
      factors will be significantly associated with decline in global cognition and decline in&#xD;
      cognitive domain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: COVID-19 exposure may modify and accelerate the relation between CKD&#xD;
      progression and cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (MRI cohort): Determine the rate of cortical thinning, accumulation of WMHs, infarcts,&#xD;
      change in WM integrity, and perfusion by eGFR levels over a mean of five years. Hypothesis 2:&#xD;
      Frontotemporal cortical thinning (atrophy), increased cortical infarcts and WMH volume, and&#xD;
      especially decreased global white matter integrity will progress more quickly with lower eGFR&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2a (MRI cohort): Estimate the associations between CKD-related factors and structural and&#xD;
      functional MRI changes over a mean of five years. Hypothesis 2a: Low hemoglobin and higher&#xD;
      albuminuria will be associated with increased cortical thinning and decreased white matter&#xD;
      integrity, and higher phosphorus with increased infarcts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 (MRI cohort): Measure the association between changes in structural and functional MRI&#xD;
      and cognitive decline over a mean of five years. Hypothesis 3: Cortical thinning, increased&#xD;
      WMH, infarcts, and worsening WM integrity and will be associated with decline in global&#xD;
      cognition and cognitive domain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is innovative by: a) mapping the longitudinal trajectories of imaging to&#xD;
      longitudinal cognitive trajectories to measure the impact of CKD on brain changes, b)&#xD;
      including the entire range of CKD enriched with advanced CKD, and c) applying a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach. Our work is significant because it will inform the natural&#xD;
      history of cognitive decline and associated brain pathology in CKD and their contributors. It&#xD;
      will have impact by 1) identifying CKD patients at greatest risk for CI to alert clinicians,&#xD;
      and the timing of potential interventions, 2) measuring the effect of high phosphorus and&#xD;
      anemia on cognitive decline and brain changes, and 3) characterizing vascular and Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease brain changes in CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study Population Approximately 225 remaining BRINK CKD participants (eGFR &lt; 60; mean&#xD;
      eGFR 34) using the CKD-EPI creatinine equation) and 100 age and race matched non-CKD patients&#xD;
      with Stages 3-5 CKD (ages 50 and older will be followed in-person, by telephone, or by&#xD;
      medical records at the following locations: Hennepin Healthcare clinics, HealthPartners&#xD;
      clinics, the University of Minnesota - Fairview Clinics, and/or the Minneapolis Veterans&#xD;
      Affairs Medical Center (MVAMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A screening interview will be conducted via telephone to determine eligibility (using&#xD;
           criteria listed below) to continue to participate in BRINK 2.0 when scheduling the first&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All BRINK 2.0 participants will continue to be classified as CKD (GFR &lt; 60&#xD;
           ml/min/1.73m2) or non- CKD controls (eGFR ≥ 60 ± 5 ml/min/1.73 m2) based on their&#xD;
           initial classification at their baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At the initial and three subsequent annual face-to-face visits, the medical history&#xD;
           interview and questionnaires, cognitive testing, and physical function assessment will&#xD;
           take approximately 75-90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If the participant scores &lt; 78 on 3MSE or &lt; 18 on MOCA, an informant interview is&#xD;
           triggered either in-person or by telephone to assess the participant's risk of MCI or&#xD;
           dementia. The informant interview will be conducted with the Functional Assessment&#xD;
           Questionnaire (FAQ) instrument. If no informant is available, conduct the UPSA&#xD;
           performance-based assessment with the participant at the same time as current visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A structured telephone interview will be conducted at intervening six months with brief&#xD;
           questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If the participant has missed their last annual visit, the participant will be scheduled&#xD;
           for a face-to-face visit at six months ± two months from their last scheduled annual&#xD;
           visit with cognitive battery two (from previous six month visits, and using MOCA instead&#xD;
           of 3MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. If a participant is unable to attend an annual face to face visit, the TICS cognitive&#xD;
           phone test will be conducted within ± 2 months instead of their scheduled face-to-face&#xD;
           annual visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. If the participant initiates any modality of dialysis, or undergoes renal transplant, a&#xD;
           follow-up visit will be scheduled as soon as possible. The participant will then&#xD;
           continue to be seen at six month intervals from the initial post dialysis visit. For the&#xD;
           dialysis or transplant patients, at 6, 18, and 30 month follow-up visits, a person&#xD;
           identified as the participant's informant will be interviewed with the ADCS- IADL to&#xD;
           assess the participant's functional status and dementia status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. For the subset of non-dialysis / transplant subjects who received a baseline MRI, a&#xD;
           three year and five year follow-up MRI will be obtained if still within their three&#xD;
           month window from previous respective annual visit. If a participant has missed their 3&#xD;
           year and/or 5 year MRI, additional MRIs should be obtained following their 4th, 6th,&#xD;
           7th, or 8th year visit in order to obtain a total of a maximum of three MRIs. Follow up&#xD;
           MRIs need to be completed with a two year gap in-between each MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. An MRI will also be obtained within 90 days after dialysis initiation and then at 1 year&#xD;
           and annually thereafter for a maximum of 5 MRI's after dialysis initiation, each with a&#xD;
           90 day window from their in person visit..&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Laboratory measures: renal panel (sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, anion&#xD;
           gap, albumin, calcium, creatinine, phosphorus, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, eGFR),&#xD;
           hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1c, urine albumin, urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio,&#xD;
           creatinine, and lipid panel will be collected at baseline and annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Research biomarker labs: serum and plasma for cystatin C, IL-6 in serum, IL-6 in urine,&#xD;
           TNFα receptor-1, 8-isoprostane, parathyroid hormone, 25-OH vitamin D, advanced glycation&#xD;
           end products, clusterin, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). were obtained at baseline&#xD;
           BRINK 1 visit, and at the 3 year annual visit, or if missed then, at the next in- person&#xD;
           BRINK 2 visit. If research labs are unable to be obtained during the first BRINK 2.0 in&#xD;
           person visit, the sample will be collected at the next annual in person visit.&#xD;
