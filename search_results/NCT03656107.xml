      About the research&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently 850,000 people living with dementia in the United Kingdom. It is now&#xD;
      understand that Alzheimer's disease (AzD) can result from damaged blood vessels in the brain.&#xD;
      Brain blood flow can be measured using ultrasound, known as transcranial Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasonography (or TCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain training (BT) uses exercises or brain-teasers to try to make the brain work faster and&#xD;
      more accurately. In recent years, BT has been used to try to improve memory, mood, learning,&#xD;
      quality of life, and ability to carry out every-day activities in people with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To find out how acceptable and manageable this BT program is for people with dementia to&#xD;
           undertake larger studies of BT in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To look for any benefits for people with dementia, such as, improvements in quality of&#xD;
           life, ability to carry out everyday tasks, mood, and brain blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How will the research be carried out?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forty patients with AzD, or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and twenty healthy older&#xD;
           adults will be recruited from memory and geriatric clinics, Join Dementia Research,&#xD;
           general practice surgeries and community groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomly assigned to brain training or control. The control group&#xD;
           will be offered the program at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First visit: Participants will complete questionnaires on quality of life, mood,&#xD;
           everyday abilities, memory and an assessment of brain blood flow&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain training program: Participants will complete 15-30 minute sessions, 3-5 times per&#xD;
           week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up: participants will repeat the questionnaires and assessment of brain blood&#xD;
           flow&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews and feedback: to discuss how participants felt the program went, and find out&#xD;
           if there are any ways it could be improved.&#xD;

      Study design, recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomised clinical trial, undertaken at the University of Leicester,&#xD;
      University Hospitals of Leicester (UHL) and Leicestershire Partnership National Health&#xD;
      Service (NHS) Trusts (LPT). Following successful ethical approval, sponsorship, regulatory&#xD;
      approvals, 40 participants with a diagnosis of MCI, or AzD, and 20 healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      recruited from memory clinics, general geriatric clinics, Join Dementia Research, community&#xD;
      groups. Patients with a diagnosis of mild MCI, or mild to moderate AzD that are not under&#xD;
      follow-up with the memory service will also be invited to participate in the study by letter&#xD;
      invitation through their GP surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumosity© is a commercially available software, developed by a group of neuropsychologists,&#xD;
      which has been used across several studies of brain training and disciplines. The brain&#xD;
      training software targets multiple brain areas, is based online, and is relatively easy to&#xD;
      use and administer. It has been designed to adapt to the individual's memory performance to&#xD;
      personalise the training program to their needs. Brain exercises will be selected with the&#xD;
      support of Lumosity© to target the following brain areas; attention, memory, visuospatial,&#xD;
      verbal fluency, and language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet the inclusion criteria, will undergo formal written consent with a&#xD;
      member of the research team, or research delivery officer, either at home, designated LPT&#xD;
      research space, memory service, or invited to attend the Leicester Cerebral Haemodynamics in&#xD;
      Ageing and Stroke Medicine (CHiASM) research laboratory. Baseline assessments will be&#xD;
      performed at this first visit including; background information on age, sex, ethnicity,&#xD;
      medical conditions, and medication use, the Edinburgh handedness inventory (to determine left&#xD;
      or right hand dominance), and questionnaires on mood, quality of life, and ability to carry&#xD;
      out everyday activities. Participants who have had their baseline assessment at home will&#xD;
      then be referred to the researcher to undertake a baseline assessment of brain blood flow at&#xD;
      the CHiASM research space. This will be undertaken by performing selected questions from a&#xD;
      memory test covering five major brain areas(attention, fluency, language, visuospatial and&#xD;
      memory) with continuous TCD (ultrasound), heart rate (ECG), blood pressure (finger blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor), and waste gases (CO2 - nasal tubes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the collection of baseline information, participants will be chosen at random to&#xD;
      either complete a brain training program or control. Randomisation will be performed using&#xD;
      Sealed Envelope©. This is an online based randomisation tool which uses random permuted&#xD;
      blocks to allocate participants to waiting list control or intervention. Participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled and assigned a participant identification number (PIN) consecutively, and randomised&#xD;
      to a treatment arm corresponding to the PIN. Given the nature of the trial, it is not&#xD;
      possible to blind participants to the intervention. The Investigator will be providing weekly&#xD;
      telephone support with the intervention, in addition to undertaking baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      measurements, and therefore blinding of the investigator is also not possible. However, data&#xD;
      analysis will be blinded by generating a batch anonymised data set. Randomisation will be&#xD;
      undertaken at the initial visit. As this is an un-blinded trial, code breaking will not be&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control participants will be waiting listed to receive the brain training program at the end&#xD;
      of the study. Participants selected to brain training will be given instructions on how to&#xD;
      access and use the program at home for 15-30minutes, 3-5 times per week for 8-12 weeks.&#xD;
      Adherence to the program can be monitored through Lumosity©. During the 8-12 weeks&#xD;
      participants will be provided with technical support by the investigator to minimise&#xD;
      adherence issues and will be offered a weekly telephone call to assist with any issues that&#xD;
      have arisen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be invited to follow up assessment at 8-12 weeks, where the TCD&#xD;
      (ultrasound) assessment of brain blood flow will be repeated, in addition to memory testing,&#xD;
      mood, quality of life, and ability to carry out daily activities. All travel and parking&#xD;
      expenses to and from the study for assessments will be refunded to participants, and&#xD;
      refreshments will be provided. No financial incentive will be offered for participating in&#xD;
      this study. Participants will be provided with a lay summary of the results at the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative sub-study&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative study will be undertaken following the training program, which will take the&#xD;
      form of interviews and a focus group to determine barriers and facilitators (benefits) to the&#xD;
      brain training program. A sample of the participants who completed the brain training program&#xD;
      and who are willing to return for interview will be included in this study. Participants will&#xD;
      be recruited until thematic saturation is achieved (i.e. where no further themes arise from&#xD;
      interviews or focus group). The maximum number of participants recruited to this arm would be&#xD;
      twenty (only patient participants who have completed the intervention arm will be recruited).&#xD;
      Where possible, the investigators will interview participants jointly with their carers in&#xD;
      order to obtain a broader view of the impact of brain training on patients and their support&#xD;
      network. This would allow the investigators to explore the potential wider impacts of these&#xD;
      interventions on patients, and benefits not measured by the outcomes described above.&#xD;
