  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This AR1001-ADP3-US01 protocol is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-&#xD;
      center, parallel-group comparison pivotal Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of AR1001 for the treatment of participants with early AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AR1001 in participants&#xD;
      with Early Alzheimer's Disease (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AR1001 is a small molecule that has demonstrated its potential as a therapeutic agent for AD&#xD;
      via its polypharmacological characteristics with multiple mechanisms to ameliorate AD&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AriBio completed a Phase 2 study in the United States (US) with AR1001 for the treatment of&#xD;
      participants with mild to moderate AD. After confirming AR1001's therapeutic benefit in the&#xD;
      mild AD population, AriBio is proceeding with a Phase 3 program in an early AD population&#xD;
      including participants with MCI and mild dementia.&#xD;
