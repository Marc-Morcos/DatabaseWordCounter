  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of home-dwelling people with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are&#xD;
      one of the most rapidly growing populations in the United States. Among ADRD caregivers with&#xD;
      unmet health-related social needs, this study aims to evaluate the effects of the CRx-C&#xD;
      intervention versus usual care on caregiver self-efficacy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CRx-C intervention is a caregiver-centered adaptation of CommunityRx (Crx), an&#xD;
      information-based intervention that systematically matches people to nearby community&#xD;
      resources for health-related social needs. We are conducting a single-blind randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial and enrolling caregivers through UChicago-affiliated clinic sites.&#xD;
      Caregivers will be screened and asked about unmet health-related social needs at the&#xD;
      outpatient visit. Eligible, self-identified caregivers will complete an in-person baseline&#xD;
      survey on-site (face to face), followed by phone surveys at 7, 30, 90 days, and 12 months.&#xD;
      Caregivers randomized to the intervention will receive tailored information on community&#xD;
      resources for their identified health-related social needs. They will also be given access to&#xD;
      an online community-resource tool and shown how to use it, so they can search for additional&#xD;
      resources in their community beyond the point-of-care and outside of the clinic. All&#xD;
      caregivers (regardless of research arm) will also receive a series of text messages related&#xD;
      to the study such as reminders to schedule the phone survey with a member of the research&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated sample (n=414) includes pretest participants (n=20), RCT participants&#xD;
      (n=344), and participants recruited from the gender supplement award (n=50).&#xD;

    <description>Self-efficacy is measured with a 4-item sub-domain from the 2015 Caregiver Dementia Care and Self-Efficacy Survey (Jennings et al). Responses to each of the items are scored between 1 = &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 5 = &quot;strongly agree&quot; and will generate an average score.</description>
