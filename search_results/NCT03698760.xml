  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For twenty years research has shown a strong link between olfactory disorders and Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. The focus is on the very early alteration of the olfaction which acts as a harbinger&#xD;
      of the disease since it is detectable in its asymptomatic phase. In addition, olfactory&#xD;
      involvement is a precursor to the transformation of mild cognitive impairment into MA. Indeed&#xD;
      the anatomical structures the first lesions are located in the transentorhinal region of the&#xD;
      temporal lobe and entorhinal phase, before progressing towards the limbic system, which will&#xD;
      mark the clinical appearance of the first signs of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In literature, it has been shown that there was no olfactory test that is recognized as a&#xD;
      gold standard in the scientific community due to a lack of homogeneity of the tools used,&#xD;
      their availability and their validity depending on the culture. Moreover, of all the tests&#xD;
      currently available, none are specific to neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very recent studies show that there is also a strong preference for imaging tools or&#xD;
      biomarkers in the detection of AD, but it appears that the olfactory disorders are well&#xD;
      before these markers. It has been shown that an identification test is comparable in&#xD;
      predictive accuracy to neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will therefore focus on the calibration and validation of a computerized olfactory&#xD;
      test for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and based the recommendations of professionals&#xD;
      so as to promote the effective use of this test in clinical practice.&#xD;

All fragrances tested are kept in an airtight case protected from cold and heat.&#xD;
The test is done on a tablet and the data will be automatically saved. The first screen is about the administrative data, sex and age of the subject. Olfactory test: six odors among the fourteen are proposed in a randomized way.</description>
