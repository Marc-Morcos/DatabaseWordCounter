  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will adapt and pilot test an efficacious advance care planning&#xD;
      interventions, SPIRIT (Sharing Patient's Illness Representations to Increase Trust), with&#xD;
      patients with mild dementia and their surrogates to promote open, honest discussions while&#xD;
      such discussions about end-of-life care are possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes two phases: Phase I to adapt, pretest, and refine SPIRIT, and Phase II to&#xD;
      pilot test the refined SPIRIT to formally evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy. The final products will be the modified SPIRIT intervention that&#xD;
      improves dementia patient and surrogate outcomes, and standardized intervention manuals,&#xD;
      including the SPIRIT Interview Guide, fidelity assessment, and training materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and surrogate decision maker dyads will participate in a single SPIRIT session and&#xD;
      will then have a follow up phone call 2-3 days later. One year after the SPIRIT session some&#xD;
      surrogates will be contacted to provide additional feedback about the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progressive memory loss and impairment of reasoning and judgment are the main symptoms of&#xD;
      dementia (including Alzheimer's Disease). For this reason, people in the early stages of&#xD;
      dementia are encouraged to engage in advance care planning (ACP) while they are still&#xD;
      competent to appoint a surrogate decision maker and meaningfully participate in ACP&#xD;
      discussions with the surrogate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common type of ACP is completing a medical power of attorney or living will, which&#xD;
      does not require the patient and/or the family to understand the complexity of the medical&#xD;
      decision-making process faced by the surrogate as the patient progresses to advanced disease.&#xD;
      The failure to engage in ACP before the window of opportunity closes (i.e., before loss of&#xD;
      decision making capacity) has serious adverse consequences with the greatest impact on the&#xD;
      surrogate. As a matter of course in dementia, family members are left to make decisions&#xD;
      regarding care transition, tube feeding, and other life-sustaining treatment without input&#xD;
      from the patient and in the absence of a full understanding of the wishes, values and&#xD;
      preferences of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To make an impact on the state of ACP for patients with dementia and their surrogates, the&#xD;
      researchers will adapt and pilot test an efficacious ACP intervention, SPIRIT (Sharing&#xD;
      Patient's Illness Representations to Increase Trust), with patients with mild dementia and&#xD;
      their surrogates to promote open, honest discussions while such discussions about end-of-life&#xD;
      care are possible. SPIRIT is a brief, scalable patient- and family-centered ACP intervention&#xD;
      based on the Representational Approach to Patient Education with a goal to promote cognitive&#xD;
      and emotional preparation for end-of-life decision making for patients with a serious or&#xD;
      life-threatening illness and their surrogates. SPIRIT focuses on having both the patient and&#xD;
      the surrogate fully understand end-of-life decision making in anticipation of a loss of&#xD;
      decision-making capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase I of the study, a panel of seven experts will provide feedback on adapting&#xD;
      SPIRIT to persons with dementia and their surrogates. SPIRIT will also be adapted to a video&#xD;
      conference format so that patients and surrogates can receive the intervention in their home.&#xD;
      To pretest the adapted SPIRIT intervention, the first 10 patient and surrogate dyads will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to SPIRIT-in person or to SPIRIT-remote. After completion of each session&#xD;
      the interventionist will make field notes to document what did or did not go well, reasons&#xD;
      for interruptions or difficulties, and contextual factors that cannot be captured in the&#xD;
      audio-recording. During the post-intervention assessment each participant will complete the&#xD;
      preparedness outcome questionnaires and will be asked about the overall experience with&#xD;
      SPIRIT, any facets of the intervention that the participant found helpful or not helpful and&#xD;
      the reasons (pacing, length, and modality), and suggestions for improvement. The researchers&#xD;
      will alter or refine the intervention before pretesting a second set of 10 dyads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II of the study is a randomized clinical trial with three groups: SPIRIT-in person,&#xD;
      SPIRIT-remote, and usual care. The researchers will recruit 120 dyads of patients with mild&#xD;
      dementia and their surrogates. The groups will be stratified by race (white vs non-white).&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are patient and surrogate self-reported preparedness for end-of-life&#xD;
      decision making which will be measured at baseline and shortly after the intervention (by&#xD;
      phone in the next 2-3 days). Additionally, the researchers will compare the completion rates&#xD;
      of advance directives among the three groups and the impact of the three treatment conditions&#xD;
      perceived by surrogates at 1-year post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of July 2020, recruitment of Phase II participants into the SPIRIT-in person study arm&#xD;
      ceased in consideration of social distancing guidelines due to the severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Participants enrolled after this date will will&#xD;
      be randomized to the SPIRIT-remote or usual care study arms.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>During Phase I, 20 patient and surrogate dyads (40 participants in total) participated in the first phase of the study which refined the intervention to address the needs of this specific population. The dyads were randomized to the SPIRIT-in person or SPIRIT-remote study arms. Enrollment and data collection for Phase I was completed in October 2018.&#xD;
In the randomized control trial portion of the study (Phase II), 120 dyads (240 participants in total) will be randomized to one of three different study arms: SPIRIT-in person, SPIRIT-remote, or usual care.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in dyad congruence among Phase II participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, follow up phone call (2-3 days post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Dyad congruence will be assessed using the Goals-of-Care Tool which has been modified to include two scenarios relevant to the context of dementia. There are three response options: &quot;The goals of care should focus on delaying my death no matter what, and thus I want to continue life-sustaining treatment&quot;, &quot;The goals of care should focus on my comfort and peace, and thus I do not want life-sustaining treatment&quot;, and &quot;I am not sure&quot;. Patients and surrogates complete this tool independently and their responses are then compared to determine dyad congruence (either congruent in both scenarios or incongruent). If both members of the dyad endorse &quot;I am not sure&quot;, they are considered incongruent.</description>

    <measure>Change in Surrogate's Decision Making Confidence (DMC) scale score among Phase II participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, follow up phone call (2-3 days post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Surrogate decision-making confidence will be measured using the 5-item Decision Making Confidence (DMC) scale. DMC assesses a surrogate's confidence in knowing the patient's wishes, ability to make treatment decisions even in a highly stressful situation, ability to seek information about risks and benefits of medical choices, ability to handle unwanted pressure from others, and ability to communicate with providers about the patient's wishes. Surrogates indicate how confident they are about making medical decisions, if the patient becomes unable to make their own decisions, by their level of agreement with statements along a scale of (0) &quot;not confident at all&quot; to (4) &quot;Very confident&quot;. Total scores range from 0 - 20, with higher scores indicating greater confidence.</description>

    <measure>Change in Surrogate's Overall Preparedness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, follow up phone call (2-3 days post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Overall Preparedness Scale for end-of-life decision making for surrogates is a 21-item investigator-developed measure. The measure assesses the level of preparedness for end-of-life decision making in the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions on a 4-point scale (1=strongly disagree to 4=strongly agree). Total scores range from 21 to 84, with higher scores indicating higher levels of preparedness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Completion of Advance Directives among Phase II participants</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Medical records will be reviewed to determine if the patient completed an advance directive (a medical power of attorney or living will) by 12 months post-intervention. If there is no documentation, the surrogate will be contacted to get confirmation on the status of the Advance Directive.</description>
