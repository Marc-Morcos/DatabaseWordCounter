  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The WeCareAdvisor is an online tool to help caregivers manage behavioral and psychological&#xD;
      symptoms of people living with dementia. The trial will evaluate its efficacy to reduce&#xD;
      caregiver distress, improve confidence managing behaviors, as well as reduce occurrences and&#xD;
      severity of behavioral and psychological symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers enrolled in the study will use the web-based WeCareAdvisor tool for either three&#xD;
      or six months, depending upon group allocation (immediate treatment vs. 3-month waitlist).&#xD;
      Caregivers will be interviewed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months by telephone to evaluate their&#xD;
      health and wellbeing. Also, utilization data of the tool will be captured.&#xD;
