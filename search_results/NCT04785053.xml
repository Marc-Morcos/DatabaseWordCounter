    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to examine the effects of non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation on episodic memory performance&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A group of 20 cognitively intact younger participants (age 21-35), a group of 20 cognitively&#xD;
      intact older participants (age 55+) and an age-matched group of 20 MCI/mild AD participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the brain stimulation study with behavioral assessments at baseline and&#xD;
      post-intervention. All participants will perform a laboratory-based memory task and an&#xD;
      autobiographical memory task, followed by the autobiographical interview after the tACS&#xD;
      intervention. Each participant will undergo three experimental sessions, applying 20-minute&#xD;
      gamma tACS stimulation, theta tACS stimulation or an active sham (control) to the left&#xD;
      angular gyrus. Before, during, and after the brain stimulation scalp high-density&#xD;
      257-channels EEG will be recorded to characterize and differentiate brain activity and&#xD;
      regional interactions in the three independent groups.&#xD;
