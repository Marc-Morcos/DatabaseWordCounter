      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of galantamine treatment in&#xD;
      patients with mild cognitive impairment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
      Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are clinically at risk for development of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease will be treated for 24 months with either placebo or galantamine&#xD;
      hydrobromide. Memory and overall clinical improvement will be evaluated using the Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease Assessment Scale with cognitive subscale adapted to MCI (ADAS-cog/MCI) and the&#xD;
      Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of the Boxes (CDR-SB). Overall functional skills and the&#xD;
      severity of dementia will be assessed with the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of the Boxes&#xD;
      (CDR-SB) and the overall Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score. Additional assessments include&#xD;
      the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) to measure attention. Safety will be assessed using&#xD;
      adverse event reports, vital signs, laboratory parameters, physical examination, and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram. The study hypothesis is that treatment with galantamine will be well&#xD;
      tolerated and, compared with placebo, will significantly improve the signs and symptoms&#xD;
      associated with mild cognitive impairment in patients who are considered likely to develop&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine hydrobromide immediate-release tablets (4, 8, or 12&#xD;
      milligrams), taken by mouth 2 times daily: 8mg/day for 4 weeks, 16mg/day for 4 weeks, then&#xD;
      increased to 24mg/day for the remainder of the 24-month trial. Doses may be reduced at&#xD;
      investigator's discretion after 12 weeks.&#xD;
