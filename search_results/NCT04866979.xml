  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presently, few studies have evaluated the clinical impact of rTMS in Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
      Though some studies have demonstrated an improvement, there have been conflicting results, as&#xD;
      others do not seem to demonstrate beneficial effects. Furthermore, it is the combined&#xD;
      application of rTMS with cognitive training that could represent a real turning point in&#xD;
      interventions aiming to slow down cognitive decline resulting from AD. Research has shown&#xD;
      that the best way to promote the strengthening of a network is to stimulate the area while&#xD;
      simultaneously activating the network (i.e. through cognitive training) which supports the&#xD;
      specific function of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, there have been new protocols from animal model research showing that &quot;bursts&quot; of&#xD;
      repetitive stimulation at a high theta frequency induce synaptic plasticity in a much shorter&#xD;
      time period than required by standard rTMS protocols. This type of rTMS stimulation,&#xD;
      theta-burst stimulation (TBS), is therefore even more compelling as a therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention given that it includes the benefits previously ascribed to other rTMS protocols,&#xD;
      but requires less administration time. Furthermore, studies conducted using both types of&#xD;
      stimulation suggest that TBS protocols are capable of producing long term effects on cortical&#xD;
      excitability that exceed the efficacy of those using standard rTMS protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project offers patients the possibility of accessing an innovative non-invasive, and&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment. The goal is to evaluate the clinical efficacy TBS in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with mild cognitive decline (MCI) and AD, verifying if TBS in conjunction with&#xD;
      cognitive training produces results better than those obtainable with only one of the two&#xD;
      methodologies alone. Patients will be evaluated throughout the full scope of the treatment&#xD;
      period, through clinical assessments and neuropsychological evaluations. We will examine&#xD;
      neuroplastic changes by investigating the neural correlates underlying improvements using the&#xD;
      multimodal imaging technique: TMS-EEG co-registration. A secondary objective will be to&#xD;
      define the most effective stimulation protocol, verifying if TBS applied continuously (cTBS)&#xD;
      or intermittently (iTBS) produces better behavioral outcomes. The results will be crucial to&#xD;
      gain a better understanding of the mechanisms through which brain stimulation contributes to&#xD;
      the promotion of neuroplasticity, and the efficacy of TBS combined with cognitive training.&#xD;

      METHODS AND PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The materials and methods of investigation proposed will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of rTMS in theta burst mode (TBS - intermittent and continuous)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of computerized cognitive training&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of a battery of neuropsychological tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of questionnaires and scales&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recording of the electroencephalogram (EEG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination of EEG recording with single-pulse TMS administration (TMS-EEG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different TBS stimulation protocols will be applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS): this protocol consists in the&#xD;
           administration of 600 pulses divided into blocks of 3 pulses at 50 Hz which are applied&#xD;
           at 5 Hz (every 200 ms), alternating 2 s of stimulation with 8 s of pause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS): this protocol consists in the administration&#xD;
           of 600 pulses divided into blocks of 3 pulses at 50 Hz that are applied at 5 Hz (every&#xD;
           200 ms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both stimulation protocols, the stimulation intensity will be equal to 80% of the motor&#xD;
      threshold value at rest. As for the protocols that involve the application of sham/placebo&#xD;
      stimulation, the rTMS will be administered by applying to the coil a piece of wood or plastic&#xD;
      of about 30 mm in thickness, a distance that ensures that the magnetic pulse does not reach&#xD;
      the cortex, and built so as to appear as an integral part of the apparatus. All stimulation&#xD;
      parameters adopted in this study are in accordance with the safety guidelines for the&#xD;
      application of rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive rehabilitation protocol For patients assigned to the protocol including the&#xD;
      application of cognitive training (TBS + CT; CT), the training will be administered&#xD;
      immediately following the application of rTMS (both in the real intermittent or continuous&#xD;
      condition, and placebo) and will last 25 minutes. Cognitive training will be administered&#xD;
      through dedicated software that uses an individualized adaptive methodology based on the&#xD;
      participant's performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rehabilitation of memory functions, associated with the stimulation of the left DLPFC,&#xD;
      will be focused on learning face-name associations. The face-name association training&#xD;
      involves an acquisition phase in which patients are shown faces with an associated name and&#xD;
      are asked to memorize these associations. The reproduction phase follows the training phase,&#xD;
      in which the patient's task will consist in finding the face that corresponds to the&#xD;
      associated name. Based on the patient's performance, the level of difficulty is modulated by&#xD;
      increasing or decreasing the number of associations to be memorized and possibly, for higher&#xD;
      difficulty levels, by adding other information to be memorized (for example, a profession).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological and psychological evaluation All patients will undergo a&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment before the start of treatment (t0), at the end of the intensive&#xD;
      treatment phase (t1), at the end of the maintenance phase (t2), and after 3 (t3) and 5 months&#xD;
      (t4) from the start of treatment (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the patients after some time (follow-up) from the end of the treatment will&#xD;
      allow for the verification of long-term effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possible &quot;practice effect&quot; resulting from the repeated and quick administration of&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests is expected and will be considered in the data analysis, as in all&#xD;
      experimental protocols of this type. The practice effect is a factor common to all&#xD;
      experimental groups and does not affect the evaluation of the efficacy of the treatment, the&#xD;
      primary objective of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EEG will be acquired from 64 sintered Ag / AgCl electrodes placed on the scalp in&#xD;
      accordance with the international 10-20 system through an EEG acquisition system compatible&#xD;
      with TMS. The EEG signal will be acquired with a high-pass filter at 0.01 Hz, a low-pass&#xD;
      filter at 1000 Hz and with a sampling frequency of 5000 Hz. The impedance of the electrodes&#xD;
      will be kept below 5 kΩ. The TMS-EEG co-registration will consist in the administration of&#xD;
      120 pulses on the target area stimulated in the application phase of the protocol (right&#xD;
      DLPFC or left DLPFC) at an intensity equal to 110% of the motor threshold at rest with a&#xD;
      random frequency between 0.2- 0.4 Hz. The analysis of the data recorded by the combination of&#xD;
      TMS-EEG will allow an in-depth evaluation of the modulations of cortical activity induced by&#xD;
      the different treatment protocols and, in particular, will allow the investigation of&#xD;
      cortical excitability and inhibition, connectivity cortico-cortical and the intrinsic ability&#xD;
      of the stimulated areas to generate oscillatory activity. This method will be able to provide&#xD;
      a unique measure of local cortical activity and effective cortical-cortical connectivity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characterization and organization of brain networks will be investigated using graph&#xD;
      theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables that will be considered for the analysis of clinical, neuropsychological and&#xD;
      neurophysiological data are: a) treatment effect over time (t0, t1, t2, t3, t4); b) type of&#xD;
      treatment protocol (combination of TBS and cognitive training, isolated application of TBS,&#xD;
      isolated application of cognitive training); c) type of stimulation protocol (cTBS, iTBS) and&#xD;
      d) clinical group (AD or MCI). The experimental design will be both &quot;within subjects&quot; within&#xD;
      each variable of interest (for example, investigating the difference between t1 and baseline&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of intensive treatment), and &quot;between subjects&quot; regarding the data&#xD;
      between the different treatment protocols (for example, investigating the difference between&#xD;
      combination of TBS and cognitive training and isolated application of TBS, to evaluate which&#xD;
      protocol produces the greatest benefits), between different stimulation protocols (for&#xD;
      example, investigating the difference between cTBS and iTBS to evaluate which protocol&#xD;
      produces greater benefits) and between clinical conditions (to assess whether the same&#xD;
      treatment leads to differences in the achieved benefit between the two groups of patients, AD&#xD;
      and MCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for the calculation of the sample size was defined as the effect of the&#xD;
      cTBS protocol and the iTBS protocol (both in combination with cognitive training) compared to&#xD;
      the treatment involving the combination of cognitive training with TBS placebo, and the one&#xD;
      which involves only the TBS protocols applied in isolation, on the MMSE score achieved at the&#xD;
      end of the treatment. Based on the results of a previous rTMS study on a sample of AD&#xD;
      patients (Ahmed et al. 2012), we estimate that at the end of our treatment there will be an&#xD;
      improvement in the MMSE score of at least 3 points (SD of change = 2.95) for protocols that&#xD;
      involve the combination of cognitive training and real TBS, and of 0.2 points (SD of change =&#xD;
      2.7) for the treatment that involves the combination of cognitive training and placebo&#xD;
      TBS.Considering an alpha value of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, we estimate that the number of&#xD;
      patients to be recruited should be 16 patients per group, increased to 20 per group to take&#xD;
      into account a possible dropout rate of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Techniques provided for data processing Behavioral and neurophysiological data will be&#xD;
      analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc comparisons (t-test, contrast&#xD;
      analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical processing software Data processing will be performed with BrainVision Analyzer,&#xD;
      SPSS and/or Statistica software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations and Assessment of the Risk/Benefit Ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits Based on the assumptions of the present project, patients who will receive&#xD;
      the treatment that involves the combined application of rTMS and cognitive training should&#xD;
      show a clinical response, based on the primary endpoints reported above, better than the&#xD;
      patients assigned to the protocols in which rTMS and cognitive training are applied in&#xD;
      isolation. The research also provides indirect scientific / cognitive benefits, in terms of&#xD;
      advancing knowledge on the development of treatments with proven efficacy and on the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks are represented by the use of electro-medical equipment, however, all of which have&#xD;
      EC authorization for use with patients. For this protocol, all appropriate safety measures&#xD;
      will be put in place for studies with brain stimulation as indicated by the international&#xD;
      scientific community. Although, following the international guidelines for the safe&#xD;
      administration of TMS no adverse events are expected, it should be noted that the environment&#xD;
      in which the research will take place and the personnel involved are able to cope with any&#xD;
      side effects of stimulation. The stimulation parameters chosen take into account the clinical&#xD;
      goals and safety of the participants. With regard to EEG procedures, redness of the skin&#xD;
      immediately under the electrodes is possible, following abrasion from the application of the&#xD;
      electroconductive gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the procedures foreseen by the research will be carried out paying particular attention&#xD;
      to the patient involved, adopting all the necessary measures so that no critical issues&#xD;
      related to stress or fatigue arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/Benefit Ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that in the proposed study program, the risk/benefit ratio is in favor of&#xD;
      benefit, in terms of increased knowledge and expected direct benefit for the participants.&#xD;
      According to the classification of a consensus paper, this protocol is part of class 2&#xD;
      studies, which identify studies with indirect benefits and moderate risks: these are studies&#xD;
      with patients where the clinical benefit is speculative, but from which important data could&#xD;
      come for the development of effective treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, patients will not be informed of the treatment protocol to which&#xD;
      they have been assigned but will be informed about the overall results of the study,&#xD;
      receiving a report containing a summary of the results achieved by the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study is on a voluntary basis: each subject will obtain explicit&#xD;
      information regarding the nature of the project and will have to sign a written consent&#xD;
      before they can be included. Participants can withdraw their consent to participate at any&#xD;
      time, without any consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data storage and processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be protected and anonymized according to the procedures in force. All data&#xD;
      regarding identification will be encrypted within the database and the subjects will be&#xD;
      identified only with a code. However, the nature of the study makes it necessary to preserve&#xD;
      the data regarding the identification of the participants because the project provides for&#xD;
      follow-up evaluations. Access to the database containing the collected data and the results&#xD;
      will be restricted to the researchers involved with the project. Sensitive data and all paper&#xD;
      data will be kept under lock and key at the various facilities. The research manager will&#xD;
      also be responsible for the appropriate conservation of these data. As this study involves&#xD;
      experimental data, the experimental data will later be published and shared with national and&#xD;
      international scientific communities.&#xD;
