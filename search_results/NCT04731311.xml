    <textblock>
      Usability evaluation of BrightGo cognitive telerehabilitation system. An experimental system&#xD;
      was developed to enhance standard of care (medication effect) for Early Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      populations. This computerized system will be undergo a usability evaluation by healthy and&#xD;
      by elderly participants who are in the early phase of Alzheimer's Disease. Sessions will and&#xD;
      with participants filling subjective evaluation questionnaires as well as the USE&#xD;
      standardized form. Results will be used to address any uncovered issues before a follow on&#xD;
      Pilot RCT Feasibility study. Participants will receive $25 after each evaluation session.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study will start with 2 elderly healthy volunteers (one male and one female) with preference&#xD;
      to those with no computer game experience. The healthy volunteers will each perform usability&#xD;
      sessions (2 times per week) in the first 2 weeks. They will be instructed to move the arms,&#xD;
      grasp and extend fingers, so to mimic the assumed functionality during subsequent feasibility&#xD;
      component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usability subjects will test the game controller movement, the caregiver tablet&#xD;
      interface, and test all therapeutic games. Each of the games will be tested at all levels of&#xD;
      difficulty, so to detect any previously unknown bugs. They will further test system wireless&#xD;
      communication and real-time graphics response to controller input (minimal lag and lack of&#xD;
      freezing, smooth avatar control). Finally, they will test the set motor and cognitive&#xD;
      baseline procedures, meant to adapt games to participant. Specifically, this research team&#xD;
      has developed a relaxing scene to be shown to participants while their biosensors are&#xD;
      measured. This will help interpret any changes occurring subsequently, during therapeutic&#xD;
      game interactions so to get an indication of engagement, or lack of, with the game tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each session, volunteers will fill in the USE standardized usability&#xD;
      questionnaire [Lund 2001]. This questionnaire will rate the usefulness, ease of use, ease of&#xD;
      learning, and satisfaction with the BrightGo system. The USE form will solicit comments on&#xD;
      games instructions, ergonomic issues with the new hand controllers, and degree of assistance&#xD;
      needed. Sessions will be inter-spaced with days when the programmer, engineer and our&#xD;
      Research Therapist will address issues uncovered in the previous session(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usability evaluation process will be repeated in the subsequent 2 weeks with two&#xD;
      participants in the early phase of Alzheimer's disease. Their performance will be compared&#xD;
      with that of the elderly healthy volunteers, so to better gauge the usability of the BrightGo&#xD;
      system for the targeted population. The Usability study will inform necessary BrightGo system&#xD;
      improvements prior to feasibility study. Participants with early phase of Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      will not test the caregiver tablet. Usability participants will be paid $25/session.&#xD;

    <measure>USE questionnaire to assess the usability of a computerized system</measure>
    <time_frame>At each of 4 evaluation sessions over 1 month from enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>A standardized questionnaire to assess the usefulness, satisfaction and ease of use of the BrightGo system [Lund, 2001] when evaluated by study participants. The form consists of 30 questions, each rated on a 7-point Likert scale (1 worst 7 best). The score range for this form is 30 (min) to 210 (max).&#xD;
Participants will also be able to comment in free form on aspects they liked most and least about the device.</description>

    <measure>Simulation Sickness Questionnaire for participant</measure>
    <time_frame>at enrollment (20 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Form used at screening post-consent to determine a participant's propensity for simulation sickness [Kennedy et al.,1993]. The questionnaire asks participants to score 16 symptoms on a four point scale (0-3). Score range is 0 (best outcome - no likelihood of experiencing simulation sickness with the device) to 48 (worst outcome - certainty participant will experience severe simulation sickness).</description>

The form has a score range from 0 (worst) to 30 (best) - no cognitive impairments. For the participants with early Alzheimer's Disease the form will confirm the participant is in the score range of 19-25.</description>

    <description>4 participants with undergo 4 usability evaluations each, inter-spaced by days when researchers will address design changes. 2 participants will be elderly healthy and 2 will have the early Alzheimer's disease. Each session will last up to 1 hour, during which participants will interact with tasks in the form of games. Games will be gradated in level of difficulty, increasing from session to session. They will be played with one game controller or with two controllers while participants wear an all-in-one head mounted display. The degree of cognitive engagement during tasks will be measured with custom biosensors and used in adjusting level of difficulty. Each participant will fill subjective evaluation form and a USE form assessing ease of use, usefulness, and perceived technology issues. Scores will be analyzed and data published, in conjunction with game performance data.</description>
