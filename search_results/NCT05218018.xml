    <textblock>
      The 'Western diet' characterized by high fat feeding (HFF) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD); however, little is known about mechanisms. Paradoxically, individuals who carry&#xD;
      the AD risk gene APOE E4 cognitively improve after HFF and show different metabolic responses&#xD;
      to fat intake. These responses include a more pronounced drop in systolic blood pressure and&#xD;
      a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid glucose and lactate levels. This proposal will further&#xD;
      examine the brain metabolic response to HFF using non-invasive imaging. Cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      (CBF) as assessed by functional MRI is increasingly utilized to investigate brain function,&#xD;
      given that CBF is tightly coupled to brain metabolism. Acute changes in CBF have been&#xD;
      described in response to carbohydrate ingestion in regions important for learning and memory;&#xD;
      however, no one has yet assessed CBF response to lipid. Here investigators propose to&#xD;
      characterize CBF changes to a high fat drink in older adults. This study will include a time&#xD;
      course assessment as well as analyses of global and regional change in CBF. These data would&#xD;
      serve as feasibility pilot data for an R01 application which would include cognitive and&#xD;
      peripheral metabolic data. These types of studies will provide a clearer picture of acute&#xD;
      brain metabolic response to HFF in older adults, including the effects of APOE.&#xD;

      Overview: High fat feeding (HFF) is a risk factor for AD, but this risk factor is modulated&#xD;
      by APOE genotype. Acute meal studies including lipid tolerance tests are increasingly being&#xD;
      used to understand mechanisms by which diet affects disease processes. Investigators have&#xD;
      consistently shown that E4 carriers respond differently to HFF in acute meal challenges; this&#xD;
      study will further explore this phenomenon in older adults by assessing cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      (CBF), given its tight coupling to brain metabolism. Here investigators propose to use&#xD;
      arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI as this non-invasive imaging technique can detect small&#xD;
      changes in global and regional CBF, and acute ∆CBF in response to nutrients have been&#xD;
      demonstrated in humans. With this project investigators will determine the most optimal time&#xD;
      point for detecting post-lipid ∆CBF, as well as determine which regions of the brain respond&#xD;
      to HFF. To our knowledge, this study would be the first to assess ∆CBF using ASL; these pilot&#xD;
      data will then assist with future grant applications in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims: 1. To determine which time point (1, 2, or 3 hours) produces the most robust&#xD;
      ∆CBF after ingestion of a lipid drink in 30 older adults. 2. To determine which regions of&#xD;
      the brain respond to HFF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants: All study procedures will be submitted to the UW Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board for approval. Investigators maintain a database of ~40-50 participants from the Meal&#xD;
      and Memory study who have already agreed to be contacted for future studies; investigators&#xD;
      will recruit 30 participants. Inclusion criteria are as follows: age 55 and older, able to&#xD;
      read and understand English, able to give informed consent, and able to undergo MRI and&#xD;
      ingest dairy products. All interested participants will undergo telephone screening to ensure&#xD;
      they meet inclusion criteria. If they meet criteria, they will be mailed a reminder letter&#xD;
      which will instruct them to fast the night before. They will also receive a copy of the&#xD;
      consent form to look over, and a medical history form to fill out, including an MRI safety&#xD;
      checklist which asks them about prior surgeries and whether they have any metal in their&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit: Participants will fast the night prior (12 hours prior to the visit time);&#xD;
      medications and water are ok. They will arrive at the South Lake Union facility between 8 and&#xD;
      10 am. They will undergo informed consent in a quiet room from the study team (either the PI&#xD;
      or the study coordinator) and given plenty of opportunities to ask questions. If they choose&#xD;
      not to enroll in the study, they will be discharged from the unit and parking or&#xD;
      transportation will be reimbursed. As a part of the consent process, investigators will ask&#xD;
      participants to give optional written permission on the consent form to release their APOE&#xD;
      genotype from the Meal and Memory Study, or other Alzheimer's research study they may have&#xD;
      participated in. Investigators will not disclose this genotype to anyone outside the study&#xD;
      team including the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant enrolls in the study and signs a consent form and a research HIPAA form,&#xD;
      then the protocol will begin. Vitals will be assessed by the study team, including blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, and height/weight and BMI calculation. Participant will be escorted to&#xD;
      the MRI machine by the study team, who will also bring down the lipid drink in a cooler. An&#xD;
      MRI technician experienced with research MRI procedures will conduct the MRI portion. First a&#xD;
      15 minute ASL protocol will be run, then the participant will be given the heavy cream (100&#xD;
      mls, or just under half a cup, which contains 370 calories, 40.4 grams of total fat, 23.6&#xD;
      grams of saturated fat). Investigators will encourage the participant to drink the product&#xD;
      over 5 minutes. Participants will then undergo 3 more 15-minute scans at 1, 2, and 3 hours&#xD;
      post drink. It is possible that some of the acquisition times can be slightly longer than 15&#xD;
      minutes. After the last MRI image acquisition, lunch will be offered (up to $15 at a nearby&#xD;
      restaurant), participants will receive a gift card, and parking or transportation will be&#xD;
      reimbursed, and be discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative site: UWMC will run the last 2-4 participants to ensure the MRI protocols and&#xD;
      sequences are similar, in order to prepare for Lipid MRI 2.0. Participants will check in at&#xD;
      the DISC lab and vitals will be done there including height and weight for BMI calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI protocol: The MRI is non-invasive with no need for contrast. In addition, investigators&#xD;
      will not be performing a clinical MRI and these findings cannot be used to diagnose any brain&#xD;
      condition. For the ASL protocol, we will use pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling to&#xD;
      measure CBF in ml/100g/min as a marker of perfusion for improved signal quality. In this&#xD;
      approach, magnetically labeled arterial blood water serves as the endogenous contrast.&#xD;
      Investigators will use a sequence (5.5 minutes) with long label duration = 1.8 s, long&#xD;
      post-labeling delay = 2 s, with labeling offset = 25-30 mm, slices = 20, spatial resolution =&#xD;
      3.5×3.5×5 mm3, field of view = 240×240×100 mm3, SENSE-factor = 2, TR/TE= 5000/18 ms.&#xD;
      Investigators will apply dual adiabatic background suppression pulses to minimize gray and&#xD;
      white matter tissue contamination at TI = 2.05 and 3.25 s. Finally, investigators will&#xD;
      acquire an equilibrium magnetization scan (M0, 1 minute), identical to the above scan, but&#xD;
      with TR = 10,000 ms and no labeling or background suppression. For the last 8 subjects&#xD;
      investigators will add a T2 multi-echo sequence (approximately 10 minutes) to detect changes&#xD;
      in the appearance of the hypothalamus from before to after lipid ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Analysis will be done under the supervision of Dr. Rane and the UW Diagnostic&#xD;
      Imaging Sciences Center (DISC). Investigators will first apply motion correction to the&#xD;
      arterial spin labeling images using FSL-MCFLIRT and register them to the M0 image. Then,&#xD;
      investigators will perform a pair-wise subtraction between the control and null images and&#xD;
      apply a two-compartment model to quantify CBF. Investigators will co-register the resulting&#xD;
      CBF map to the T1 scan followed by a transformation to MNI space. The temporal regions such&#xD;
      as the entorhinal cortex, temporal lobe, hippocampus as well as the posterior cingulate and&#xD;
      lateral parietal lobules will be identified using standard Harvard-Oxford Cortical and&#xD;
      Subcortical atlas. CBF values will be compared in these regions between the 3 groups. The&#xD;
      region of interest approach can dilute effects that are smaller than the size of the region&#xD;
      of interest. Therefore, we will also perform permutations testing in FSL to evaluate&#xD;
      voxel-wise CBF differences between group. In order to ensure that the voxel-wise outcomes are&#xD;
      not mere chance, investigators will impose strict family-wise error correction for multiple&#xD;
      comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: From these images investigators will obtain measures on global blood flow as well&#xD;
      as regional blood flow in pre-defined regions. Investigators will utilize standard&#xD;
      statistical models to compare the 1, 2, and 3 hour ASL to the baseline ASL to ascertain what&#xD;
      time point produces the most robust change result. If analyses of the first few subjects&#xD;
      necessitate, time points can shift earlier or later, depending on what time point shows the&#xD;
      maximum change in CBF-the primary outcome.&#xD;
