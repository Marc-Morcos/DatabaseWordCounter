    <textblock>
      As a traditional Chinese medicine compound, Yangxue Qingnao Pills is proven to have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on learning and memory ability in animal models of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease(AD). The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Yangxue&#xD;
      Qingnao Pills on patients with mild to moderate AD. This phase II randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      parallel controlled trial include a 2 weeks run-in period, and a 48 weeks double-blind&#xD;
      treatment period of after randomization. Participants will be randomly allocated to Yangxue&#xD;
      Qingnao pills high dose group (7.5 g per time,2 times per day) ; and Yangxue Qingnao pills&#xD;
      low dose group (5 g per time,2 times per day), or placebo group. The outcome measures include&#xD;
      general cognitive function, ability of daily living, and behavioural and psychological&#xD;
      symptoms in AD patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Yangxue Qingnao pills is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, which is composed of&#xD;
      Angelicae Sinensis Radix , Chuanxiong Rhizoma , Paeoniae Radix Alba, Rehmannia glutinosa,&#xD;
      Uncaria macrophylla Wall, Caulis spatholobi, Spica Prunellae, Catsia tora Linn , Mater&#xD;
      Margarita, Corydalis ambigua and Asarum sieboldii. The function of Yangxue Qingnao pills is&#xD;
      nourishing blood and calming liver, promoting blood circulation and dredging collaterals in&#xD;
      Chinese traditional medicine theory. This study is a 48-weeks, multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, parallel controlled phase II trial being carried out in China. The study&#xD;
      population includes mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (planned a total of 216) aged 65-85&#xD;
      in both gender. Participants will be randomly allocated to Yangxue Qingnao pills high dose&#xD;
      group (7.5 g per time,2 times per day) ; and Yangxue Qingnao pills low dose group (5 g per&#xD;
      time,2 times per day), or placebo group for a 48-weeks double-blind treatment period. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure is change from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-&#xD;
      Cognition Subscale (ADAS-cog) and the clinical dementia rating scale. The secondary outcomes&#xD;
      are changes from baseline in the Mini-Mental State Examination(MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL/24) and Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Inventory. Besides, the blood biomarkers including Aβ42, Aβ40, T-tau, P-tau181, NfL, TOM1,&#xD;
      IL-1R1,IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, FB, FH, sCR1, MCP-1, eotaxin-1, Ach, ChEI and the&#xD;
      hippocampal volume on MRI. Safety is being assessed by observing side effects and adverse&#xD;
      reaction during the entire treatment period. Statistical analysis will be conducted according&#xD;
      to per-protocol population and intend-to-treat population and the safety will be analyzed in&#xD;
      safety set.&#xD;

    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale test is one of the most frequently used tests to measure cognition in research studies and clinical trials for new drugs and other interventions.The ADAS-Cog consists of 11 parts and takes approximately 30 minutes to administer.The test administrator adds up points for the errors in each task of the ADAS-Cog for a total score ranging from 0 to 70. The greater the dysfunction, the greater the score. A score of 70 represents the most severe impairment and 0 represents the least impairment.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) is a global assessment instrument that yields global and Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores, with the global score regularly used in clinical and research settings to stage dementia severity. The CDR-SB score is obtained by summing each of the domain box scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 18. Higher score means severe global cognition impairment.</description>
