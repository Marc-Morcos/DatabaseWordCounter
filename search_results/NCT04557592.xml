  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The GAITRite® system is an instrumented with resistive pressure sensors gait analyzer. It was&#xD;
      first validate in 2001 against paper-and-pencil (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] &gt;&#xD;
      95%) for spatial measures and against video-based (ICC &gt; 93%) for temporal measures, and was&#xD;
      thus a reliable tools to measure step lengths and times in both walkway center and&#xD;
      left-of-center measurements. It was considered as one of the gold standards in gait analyses.&#xD;
      This gait analyze system may distinguish prospectively faller and non-faller older adults,&#xD;
      but it can detect spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal measures of gait and greater&#xD;
      variability of gait parameters which were associated with and predictive of both global- and&#xD;
      domain-specific cognitive decline. Moreover, spatiotemporal gait parameters analyzed using&#xD;
      GAITRite® were more disturbed in the advanced stages of dementia, and more affected in the&#xD;
      non-AD dementia than in AD suggesting that quantitative gait parameters could be used as a&#xD;
      surrogate marker for improving the diagnosis of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, GAITRite® is not a unique system and it comprises different walkways. One of&#xD;
      these technologies was a roll-up system (platinum plus classic, RE, Basic and Safari), and&#xD;
      the other was a system composed by a changeable association of plates (CIRFACE). In order to&#xD;
      ensure a good comparability between studies using these different walkways, it appears&#xD;
      important to compare the performances of these walkways in gait analysis. Thus, the main aim&#xD;
      of this study was to compare the performances in gait analyze between the GAITRite® platinum&#xD;
      plus classic and the GAITRite® CIRFACE among older adults. Secondary aims were to compare&#xD;
      these parameters among patients with cognitive complaint, minor or major neurocognitive&#xD;
      disorder (NCD) related to Alzheimer disease.&#xD;
