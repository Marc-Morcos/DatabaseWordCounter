  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) has gradually become one of the major global public health issues&#xD;
      due to its prevalence, which increases with age and life expectancy, and the economic cost of&#xD;
      caring for patients whose cognitive decline progressively leads to loss of functional&#xD;
      autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of AD is based on a multidisciplinary approach, involving, among other things,&#xD;
      evaluation of the medical history together with clinical symptoms and signs,&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging. The quantification of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      core biomarkers (amyloid beta peptides [Ab1-40 and Ab1-42], total tau [t-tau] and its&#xD;
      phosphorylated form on threonine 181 [p-tau(181)]) has progressively proven utility for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of AD and its prodromal forms. CSF biomarkers are now included in international&#xD;
      guidelines for the diagnosis of AD in research settings and clinical practice and the&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Association appropriate use criteria for the use of lumbar puncture and CSF&#xD;
      testing in the diagnosis of AD have been published. Such biochemical diagnostics are&#xD;
      currently implemented in many specialized centers around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent progress in the biological diagnosis of AD is considerable, with the possibility,&#xD;
      thanks to ultra-sensitive tests realized notably with the SIMOA technology, of having Ab1-40,&#xD;
      Ab1-42, t-tau and p-tau(181) also detectable in the blood using commercial kits. The&#xD;
      performance for AD detection has been evaluated by many groups including on retrospective&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now essential to evaluate the interest of blood-based biomarkers of AD, prospectively&#xD;
      and in real life condition to confront them with pre-analytical and analytical variabilities.&#xD;
      It is also important to position them in relation to CSF analysis and AD management, from&#xD;
      risk assessment, diagnosis, to therapeutic strategies.&#xD;

      Rationale of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent progress in the biological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considerable, with&#xD;
      the possibility, thanks in particular to ultra-sensitive tests, of having relevant blood&#xD;
      biomarkers. These biomarkers, mainly represented by amyloid peptides, tau proteins and&#xD;
      neurofilaments, make it possible to consider a stratification of patients according to&#xD;
      different classifications, including the ATN scale. Their diagnostic value has been mainly&#xD;
      tested on retrospective samples and it is now essential to use them prospectively to confront&#xD;
      them with pre-analytical and analytical variability. It is also important to position them in&#xD;
      relation to CSF analysis and AD management, from risk assessment, diagnosis, to therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate, in a prospective consecutive enrollment clinical trial, the diagnostic&#xD;
      performance (sensitivity, specificity) of blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interest of blood biomarkers for detection of normal/pathological CSF profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interest of blood biomarkers for other disease including, amyloid angiopathy,&#xD;
           frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or lewy body disease (LBD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our laboratory daily receives CSF samples from regional &quot;memory clinics&quot; (mainly from&#xD;
      Montpellier, Nîmes, Perpignan) for Aß40, Aß42, t-Tau and p-Tau(181) assays. The results of&#xD;
      these tests performed weekly on an automated platform are used by neurologists for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of AD. In this non-interventional multi-center clinical trial, with the informed&#xD;
      consent of patients, one tube of plasma in addition to CSF is collected. In parallel with the&#xD;
      CSF, amyloid peptides and plasma p-Tau is mesured. The ApoE4 status will also be determined&#xD;
      using MS as previously published by our group. Plasma biomarkers will then be combined to&#xD;
      confirm the presence of AD, as has already been done on retrospective samples by us and&#xD;
      others. Considering a disease prevalence rate of 20% in the screened population, and to reach&#xD;
      a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity close to 90%, it is necessary to include a total of&#xD;
      311 patients in order to obtain an estimate of sensitivity and specificity with a 95%&#xD;
      accuracy of +/- 10%. The lost to follow-up rate of about 10% requires the enrollment of 342&#xD;
      patients. The diagnostic performance of this profile will be compared to that of CSF, as well&#xD;
      as to the diagnosis assessed by a multidisciplinary team one year after sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The confirmation that blood biomarkers of AD achieve satisfactory diagnostic performance in a&#xD;
      clinical setting allows them to be considered in routine use, as a less invasive method, thus&#xD;
      with greater acceptance and also the possibility of longitudinal use. The benefit also lies&#xD;
      in the evaluation of the interest of supplemental biomarkers such as NfL, for related&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
