      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the drug cyclophosphamide (CY) on&#xD;
      inflammation and immune responses in individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation and immunologic response appear to contribute to neurodegeneration in people&#xD;
      with AD. In a process called gliosis, the brain immune cells microglia and astroglia undergo&#xD;
      activation and possible proliferation, which promotes neuronal injury and death. Activated&#xD;
      microglia and astroglia produce compounds that are cytotoxic to neurons, and they express&#xD;
      molecules that greatly amplify immune and inflammatory processes in the brain. Excessive&#xD;
      glial activation and proliferation are thought to be pivotal events that hasten the demise of&#xD;
      synapses and neurons in AD. Fortunately, increased understanding of immune and inflammatory&#xD;
      pathology in AD has provided new opportunities for designing disease-altering treatments for&#xD;
      AD. Studies suggest that medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
      and immunomodulatory agents may have an important role in altering the course of AD. CY is a&#xD;
      potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drug that inhibits proliferation of immune&#xD;
      cells. This study will evaluate the effects of CY on individuals with mild to moderate AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either two different doses of&#xD;
      CY or placebo (an inactive pill) for 6 months. Participants who receive placebo during the 6&#xD;
      months will have the option of receiving CY for an additional 6 months. Participants will&#xD;
      undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Measures of cerebral spinal&#xD;
      fluid biomarkers or neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmune activation will be&#xD;
      taken. In addition, peripheral lymphocyte subsets and peripheral markers of inflammation will&#xD;
      be assessed.&#xD;

      Objectives. The protocol is focused on the immune and inflammatory reactions in Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD) and the possibility that blocking the inflammatory response may alter the course&#xD;
      of the illness. The specific plan is to evaluate the biologic and clinical effects of two&#xD;
      doses of cyclophosphamide (CY) immunotherapy in AD patients compared to the clinically&#xD;
      available cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (COX-2), rofecoxib. The study will test the hypotheses&#xD;
      that CY: 1) Is safe and tolerable in AD patients in meaningful clinical doses, 2) Can modify&#xD;
      central nervous system inflammation and immune responses in AD, 3) Inhibits neurodegeneration&#xD;
      in AD brains as indicated by peripheral biomarkers of AD pathology, and 4) Is different&#xD;
      quantitatively or qualitatively in its effect on immune markers than placebo or other&#xD;
      clinically-available anti-inflammatory drugs such as the COX-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale. Inflammation and immunologic responses appear to contribute significantly to&#xD;
      neurodegeneration in (AD). In a pathological process termed gliosis, the brain's resident&#xD;
      immune cells (microglia and astroglia) undergo chronic activation and possible proliferation,&#xD;
      promoting neuronal injury and death by several means. Activated microglia and astroglia&#xD;
      produce compounds that are directly cytotoxic to neurons, and they express molecules that&#xD;
      greatly amplify immune and inflammatory processes in the brain. Excessive glial activation&#xD;
      and proliferation are thought to be pivotal events hastening the demise of synapses and&#xD;
      neurons in AD. Conversely, the growing understanding of immune and inflammatory pathology in&#xD;
      AD has provided new opportunities for designing disease-altering treatments for AD.&#xD;
      Preliminary clinical trials of anti-inflammatory drugs in AD patients, epidemiologic studies&#xD;
      of anti-inflammatory drug use, and experimental models linking neurodegeneration with&#xD;
      neuroimmune/neuroinflammatory processes suggest strongly that medications such as&#xD;
      nonsteroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and immunomodulatory agents may have an&#xD;
      important role in altering the course of AD. CY is a potent anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      immunomodulatory drug that acts primarily by inhibiting proliferation of immune cells.&#xD;
      Moreover, as immune cell proliferation appears to be an important aspect of AD&#xD;
      pathophysiology and disease progression, an exploratory, dose-finding trial of a&#xD;
      cytotoxic/cytostatic drug such as CY is appropriate, especially since CY is already widely&#xD;
      used for the treatment of other immune-mediated illnesses. Furthermore, a preliminary&#xD;
      European trial of CY in AD patients has already demonstrated an improvement in cognitive&#xD;
      function that correlated highly with the degree of immunomodulation achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. Study subjects will include 60 male and female patients with mild-moderate AD. In a&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial, two doses of CY or rofecoxib will be compared over a&#xD;
      6-month period. While the primary outcome measures will be safety and immunologic data,&#xD;
      cognitive and other behavioral measures will also be collected. The biological outcome&#xD;
      measures will include measures of brain volume (assessed by magnetic resonance imaging) and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmune&#xD;
      activation. In addition, peripheral lymphocyte subsets and peripheral markers of inflammation&#xD;
      will be assessed. This design is meant to provide dose-finding data to help design a more&#xD;
      definitive efficacy trial with CY if the safety/tolerability parameters are acceptable in&#xD;
      this pilot study.&#xD;
