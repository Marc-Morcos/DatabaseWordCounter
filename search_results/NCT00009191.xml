  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depression afflicts approximately 25 percent of patients with AD. Depression in AD&#xD;
      patients leads to mental suffering, behavioral disturbance (such as aggression), poor&#xD;
      cognition, poor self-care, caregiver depression, caregiver burden, and early entry into the&#xD;
      nursing home. Since major depression is treatable, this additional disability may be&#xD;
      avoidable. The use of antidepressants to treat major depression in AD is supported by two&#xD;
      studies, although a third does not show a benefit for antidepressants over placebo. Also, the&#xD;
      safety of antidepressant treatment in depressed AD patients is poorly studied. A conclusive&#xD;
      study showing that depression reduction in AD can be accomplished safely with antidepressant&#xD;
      medications, and that depression reduction is associated with improvements in activities of&#xD;
      daily living, non-mood behavioral disturbances, caregiver burden, and caregiver depression&#xD;
      would have major clinical and cost implications for the care of the AD patient. This study is&#xD;
      a 13-week, double blind, flexible dose, placebo controlled trial of sertraline in the&#xD;
      treatment of outpatients with AD and co-morbid major depression. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment is superior to placebo in improving mood, in improving cognition, in&#xD;
      reducing physical dependency, in reducing caregiver depression, and in reducing caregiver&#xD;
      burden. It is also hypothesized that the degree of depression reduction is correlated with&#xD;
      these improvements. It is further hypothesized that the safety profile of sertraline when&#xD;
      compared to placebo is acceptable, especially with regard to risk of falls, sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, and delirium. One hundred community residing outpatients with probable AD who&#xD;
      also meet DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode will be recruited into the study. They&#xD;
      will be randomized to sertraline or placebo and followed through weekly telephone contact by&#xD;
      an experienced clinical trials team. Outcomes will be assessed every 3 weeks, for a total of&#xD;
      four followup data points. Scales assessing the following domains will be used: depression,&#xD;
      cognition, behavioral disturbance, physical dependency, delirium, falls, sleep, other side&#xD;
      effects, caregiver depression, caregiver burden, caregiver functioning, and caregiver health.&#xD;

        Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) by NINCDS/ADRDA criteria (McKann et&#xD;
             al., 1984), with a MMSE score greater than 10&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of current major depressive episode (MD), by DSM-IV, based on the SCID-IV&#xD;
             examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be included even if they have a pre-AD history of unipolar depression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who currently are being treated with antidepressants but continue to meet&#xD;
             criteria for MD (i.e., have not responded to the medications) and who are willing to&#xD;
             discontinue the other medication and enter the study also will be included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently residing in the community (own home,family member's home, or small group&#xD;
             home) and agreeing to 13 weeks of followup in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable medical history and general health, in the opinion of the study psychiatrist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A caregiver who knows the patient well (spends at least 10 hours per week with him or&#xD;
             her), and who is in reasonably good health, agrees to participate as well&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant and his/her legal representative provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of sertraline is contraindicated, based on the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
             package insert for sertraline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or pre-AD anxiety&#xD;
             disorder, as determined by the SCID&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a current substance use disorder, as determined by the SCID&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is acutely suicidal or requires inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, as&#xD;
             determined by the study psychiatrist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No psychotropic medicine dose changes, including cholinesterase inhibitors, after&#xD;
             study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May enter with any drug except another antidepressant.&#xD;
