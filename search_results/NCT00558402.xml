      The goal is to determine how 6-week stress reduction techniques may decrease stress in&#xD;
      primary caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease. The 3 intervention programs are&#xD;
      meditation, education, and respite care. There will be approximately 108 subjects over 3&#xD;
      years. Subjects will have a screening session over the phone to see if they are eligible&#xD;
      (50-85 years old, spending at least 12 hours per week caring for a close relative with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease, willing to be in any of the 3 groups, and without any very serious&#xD;
      medical problem). The subjects will have 3 testing sessions, 1 before classes/respite and 2&#xD;
      after classes are over, each lasting about 3 hours. The classes are taught in a one-on-one&#xD;
      setting, and they are 50 minutes per week for 6 weeks. Respite care is provided for the&#xD;
      person with Alzheimer's disease in all the groups. Measurements include people's ratings of&#xD;
      stress, psychological testing, and biological measurements of stress, including the&#xD;
      following: saliva, blood, and urine collection; waist-to-hip ratio; weight; blood pressure;&#xD;
      heart rate; respiration; reaction time task; voice recordings; electrocardiogram;&#xD;
      electroencephalogram; and electro dermal activity.&#xD;

      Stress has a negative effect on many aspects of health. Older adults may be particularly&#xD;
      sensitive to adverse effects of stress because of lower physiologic reserves and coexistence&#xD;
      of other health problems. Since mind-body interventions may be most effective in conditions&#xD;
      associated with psychological stress, this research will evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      mind-body intervention in seniors who have a significant stress: being the primary caregiver&#xD;
      for a person with dementia (PWD) secondary to Alzheimer's disease. The well-being of this&#xD;
      large and growing group of Americans is a significant public health issue. We plan to study a&#xD;
      Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) program for caregivers of a PWD in a randomized&#xD;
      3-arm intervention trial. There are two comparison groups: an education group and a&#xD;
      pragmatic, respite only group. The two active interventions, MBCT and education, also include&#xD;
      identical respite care for the PWD to allow the caregiver to attend the classes. Each&#xD;
      intervention will last 6 weeks, and consist of one 50 minute class and/or or 2-3 hours of&#xD;
      respite per week along. Homework for the two groups in the classes will consist of home&#xD;
      meditation practice for the MBCT group and development of an action plan and reading for the&#xD;
      education group. Outcome measures will be assessed at 8 weeks and at 20 weeks (immediately&#xD;
      and 12 weeks after the intervention class has been completed). Our primary outcome measure&#xD;
      will be a self-rated measure of caregiver stress. There are a number of secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures representing biomarkers of stress including: salivary cortisols measured over the&#xD;
      day to include the awakening response and trough levels; inflammatory markers; and&#xD;
      electrophysiologic markers. Other secondary outcome measures include self-efficacy,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, mood, and cognitive function. We will use several measures to&#xD;
      predict response to MBCT and education in an aptitude by treatment interaction analysis.&#xD;
      These measures include the personality trait absorption, emotion-based versus problem-based&#xD;
      coping, and expectancy of improvement from each intervention. We will also use the 24-hour&#xD;
      acquisition device to evaluate the ability of subjects randomized to MBCT to induce&#xD;
      physiologic changes during self-reported mindfulness meditation and relate the magnitude of&#xD;
      these changes to improvements in outcome measures.&#xD;
