  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The close homology between the central and enteric nervous system suggests that a disease&#xD;
      process affecting the central nervous system could also involve its enteric counterpart. This&#xD;
      has already been demonstrated for patients with Parkinson's disease but needs to be proven&#xD;
      for Alzheimer's disease. Studies on enteric nervous system during Alzheimer's disease are&#xD;
      indeed in low number and don't have led to definite conclusion. The investigators thus&#xD;
      propose to realize a complete analysis of the enteric nervous systems in Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      by studying the presence of &quot;tau' protein, of beta-amyloid peptide,...&#xD;
&#xD;
      not only by immunohistochemical but also by a biochemical approach. This study will be&#xD;
      realized from colonic samples.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The close homology between the central and enteric nervous system suggests that a disease&#xD;
      process affecting the central nervous system could also involve its enteric counterpart. The&#xD;
      investigators have recently shown in that the enteric neurons can be readily analyzed using&#xD;
      routine colonic biopsies. The investigators propose that the enteric nervous system could&#xD;
      represent a unique window to assess the neuropathology in living patients with a&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disorder. The investigators have already used this approach to show that&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease pathology was recapitulated in a single colonic biopsy. By contrast to&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease, the detection of Alzheimer's disease pathology in the enteric neurons&#xD;
      has so far failed. This may be due to the low number of human tissue samples in addition to&#xD;
      the low sensitivity of the immunohistochemical methods that were used. The aim of the current&#xD;
      research project will be therefore to reevaluate Alzheimer's disease pathology in a large&#xD;
      number of human colonic samples using both a morphological and biochemical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hypothesis is that the enteric nervous system could represent a unique window to assess&#xD;
      the neuropathology in living patients with Alzheimer's disease. This might open the way to&#xD;
      the development of novel Alzheimer's disease biomarkers that will directly assess the&#xD;
      neuropathological process.&#xD;
