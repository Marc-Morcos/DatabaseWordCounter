    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAGE-718 and&#xD;
      its effects on cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in participants with mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD).&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is an AE that occurs after the first administration of a study drug.</description>

    <description>The C-SSRS scale consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of participants with suicidal ideation (SI) and suicidal behavior (SB) and a postbaseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last study visit. The C-SSRS includes 'yes' or 'no' responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant meets the following criteria for MCI or mild dementia due to AD at&#xD;
             Screening: has a memory complaint, has clinical dementia rating (CDR) score of 0.5 to&#xD;
             1.0 (inclusive) with a memory box score â‰¥0.5, has essentially preserved activities of&#xD;
             daily living&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant has a score of 15 to 24 (inclusive) on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
             at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant has normal premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ) at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant has a study partner who is reliable, competent, at least 18 years of age,&#xD;
             willing to be available to the study center by phone, support study-specific&#xD;
             activities, and accompany the participant to study visits as needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant has any medical or neurological condition (other than AD) that might be&#xD;
             contributing to the participant's cognitive impairment or history of cognitive decline&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant has a history of brain surgery, deep brain stimulation, a significant head&#xD;
             injury causing loss of consciousness greater than 30 minutes, or hospitalization due&#xD;
             to a brain injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant has a history, presence, and/or current evidence of a&#xD;
             clinically-significant intracranial abnormality (eg, stroke, hemorrhage,&#xD;
             space-occupying lesion) that could account for the observed cognitive impairment&#xD;
             (excluding abnormalities consistent with underlying AD pathology)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant has a history of possible or probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy,&#xD;
             according to the Boston Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant has a history of seizures or epilepsy, with the exception of a single&#xD;
             episode of febrile seizures in childhood&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant has current or recent suicidality&#xD;
