        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who self-identify as Hispanic and currently live in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age range: Patients &gt;= 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sex distribution: both men and women. Women must be two (2) years post-menopausal or&#xD;
             surgically sterile.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MMSE scores between 10 and 26 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have diagnostic evidence of AD (DSM-IV and NINCDS/ADRDA criteria) either&#xD;
             prior to or at the screening visit. Patients with AD who may also have cerebrovascular&#xD;
             disease as evidenced by risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, elevated&#xD;
             cholesterol levels, and smoking are also eligible to enroll in the study. In order to&#xD;
             be enrolled, such patients' clinical conditions must be controlled, and it must be the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion that the patient's primary diagnosis is AD, not vascular&#xD;
             dementia. The diagnosis of AD must be recorded in the patient's clinical record prior&#xD;
             to the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CT or MRI within the last 12 months consistent with a diagnosis of AD without any&#xD;
             other clinically significant comorbid pathologies found. Patients with vascular&#xD;
             changes may be included provided that they do not meet NINDS-AIREN criteria for&#xD;
             probable Vascular Dementia (VaD). A copy of the report will be required and should be&#xD;
             appended to the case report form. If there has been a significant change in clinical&#xD;
             status suggestive of stroke or other neurological disease in addition to AD with onset&#xD;
             between the time of the last CT or MRI and the screening evaluation, the scan should&#xD;
             be repeated during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be naïve to Aricept® treatment. Previous use of an approved or&#xD;
             unapproved cholinesterase inhibitor (Exelon® , Cognex®, Reminyl®/Razadyne®,&#xD;
             metrifonate, physostigmine) or memantine is allowed provided that the medication was&#xD;
             discontinued at least 3 months prior to screening and that the discontinuation was not&#xD;
             done for the purpose of enrolling the patient in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must reside in the community. (Residence in an assisted living facility is&#xD;
             allowed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a reliable caregiver or family member who agrees to accompany the&#xD;
             patient to all clinic visits, provide information about the patient as required by the&#xD;
             protocol, and ensure compliance with the medication schedule. The caregiver must have&#xD;
             a minimum of three days per week of direct contact with the patient (for at least 4&#xD;
             hours per day during waking hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be capable of reliably completing study assessments including all&#xD;
             efficacy parameters (MMSE, SDMT, and FOME) and all procedures scheduled during the&#xD;
             screening, baseline and all follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have clinical laboratory values within normal limits, and within the&#xD;
             Eisai (sponsor) guidelines, or abnormalities considered not clinically significant by&#xD;
             the investigator and sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with stable insulin-dependent diabetes or diabetes stabilized by diet and/or&#xD;
             oral hypoglycemic agents are eligible provided they are monitored regularly to ensure&#xD;
             adequacy of control. Patients with known diabetes should have an HbA1c of &lt; 8% at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with controlled hypertension (sitting diastolic BP &lt; 95 mmHg), right bundle&#xD;
             branch block (complete or partial), and pacemakers may be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with thyroid disease also may be included in the study provided they are&#xD;
             euthyroid and stable on treatment for at least 3 months prior to screening, and the&#xD;
             stable treatment is maintained throughout study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of seizure disorder are allowed provided that they are on&#xD;
             stable treatment for at least 3 months and have not had a seizure within the past 6&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to swallow tablet medication -- no crushing of the tablet is&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be ambulatory or ambulatory-aided (i.e., walker or cane, or wheelchair).&#xD;
             His/her vision and hearing (eyeglasses and/or hearing aid permissible) must be&#xD;
             sufficient for compliance with testing procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age range: Patients &lt; 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MMSE score of &lt; 10 or &gt; 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active or clinically significant conditions affecting absorption,&#xD;
             distribution or metabolism of the study medication (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease,&#xD;
             gastric or duodenal ulcers or severe lactose intolerance).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to piperidine derivatives or cholinesterase&#xD;
             inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients without a reliable caregiver, or patients or caregivers who are unwilling or&#xD;
             unable to complete any of the outcome measures and fulfill the requirements of this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who live in a skilled nursing facility (nursing home) or expect to enter&#xD;
             nursing home within the next 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma not&#xD;
             controlled with treatment at any time during the previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with recent (&lt; 2 years) hematological/oncological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of clinically significant, active gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine&#xD;
             or cardiovascular system disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a current DSM-lV diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or any&#xD;
             current primary psychiatric diagnosis other than AD (as per DSM-lV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with dementia complicated by delirium (DSM 290.30 or 290.11); depression or&#xD;
             delusions are common in AD, and patients with severe symptoms so pronounced that they&#xD;
             warrant an alternative, concurrent diagnosis, are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known or suspected history of alcoholism or drug abuse (within the&#xD;
             past 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated vitamin B-12 deficiency who have not been on a stable dose of&#xD;
             medication for at least 3 months prior to the study screening visit and who do not&#xD;
             have normal serum B-12 levels at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated hypothyroidism that have not been on a stable dose of medication&#xD;
             for 3 months prior to screening and who do not have normal serum T-4 and TSH at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with diabetes mellitus controlled by diet, oral medication, or insulin who do&#xD;
             not have an HbA1c of &lt; 8.0% and a random serum glucose value of &lt; 170 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients previously treated with Aricept® (donepezil Hydrochloride).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition which would make the patient or the caregiver, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, unsuitable for the study.&#xD;
