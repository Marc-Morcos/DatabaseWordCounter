  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a retrospective analysis of data from 1100 patients, disease-delaying effects of&#xD;
      Cerefolin®/CerefolinNAC® were examined in terms of cognition. The purpose of the current&#xD;
      study is to expand the retrospective study dataset by prospectively collecting additional&#xD;
      biomarker and imaging data.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CerefolinNAC® is an orally administered prescription medical food, and is formulated as a&#xD;
      combination of L-methylfolate calcium (as Metafolin®), methylcobalamin, and N-acetylcysteine.&#xD;
      In a retrospective analysis, disease-delaying effects of Cerefolin®/CerefolinNAC® (CFLN) are&#xD;
      examined in terms of cognition (measured by MCI Screen (MCIS)), and functional capacity&#xD;
      (measured by Functional Assessment Staging Test (FAST)). - the treatment effect of CFLN on&#xD;
      cognitive and functional measures, and on biomarker measures in patients with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease and related disorders (ADRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will expand the NAC-002b study dataset by prospectively collecting&#xD;
      additional biomarker and imaging data in a more comprehensively assessed, matched sample of&#xD;
      patients. This will allow more precise evaluation of cognitive and functional outcome&#xD;
      measures, and biomarker measures will be assessed in an attempt to identify specific&#xD;
      populations or conditions in which CFLN is most effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will consist of patients with homocysteinemia plus past/current CFLN treatment&#xD;
      (Treatment Group) matched to those without homocysteinemia plus no past/current B12, folate&#xD;
      or CFLN treatment (Non-Treatment Group). Also 65 additional subjects will be recruited for&#xD;
      the non-Treatment group, which will be used to improve the rate of decline estimates for the&#xD;
      cognitive and functional outcome measures.&#xD;
