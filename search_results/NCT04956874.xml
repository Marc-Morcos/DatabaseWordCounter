      Primary Aim The primary aim of this study is to test feasibility of a modified REACH II&#xD;
      intervention in an outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The FL REACH intervention can be implemented reliably in this setting, with fidelity to&#xD;
           the model and minimal burden on existing clinic structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Aims Aim 2: Examine the effectiveness of a REACH II translation in an&#xD;
           outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CG disease knowledge will increase from pre-assessment to post-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Caregiver preparedness for caregiving will increase from pre-assessment to&#xD;
           post-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perceived risk by CG (CR access to dangerous objects + smoking + supervision + wandering&#xD;
           + driving + screaming + desire to hit) will be reduced from pre-assessment to&#xD;
           post-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Caregivers will demonstrate mastery of skill acquisition related to behavior change&#xD;
           strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Caregiver burden will decrease from pre-assessment to post-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Caregiver self-rated health will improve from pre-assessment to post-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Caregivers will have initiated the process of advanced care planning by the end of the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. All measures will maintain gain in the anticipated direction from baseline measures at 6&#xD;
           months post-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Identify possible moderators of outcome, such as race/ethnicity, language, dosage or&#xD;
      relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Aim is exploratory. Based in previous evidence, we estimate similar outcomes for all&#xD;
      participants regardless of demographic factors, but previous trials have never been attempted&#xD;
      in this novel setting. We will examine the data for differential outcomes related to such&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;

    <description>The FL REACH intervention is a 6-session intervention designed to facilitate transition to care following delivery of a memory disorders diagnosis by a MDC team. The intervention focused on an approach that used a toolbox of strategies to tailor skills-based learning, knowledge transmission, and self-care strategies to dementia caregivers. This pilot study focuses on adapting the established REACH II intervention for translation to the clinical setting, with a focus not only on implementation of the key components of the program, but also on feasibility and sustainability. This is part of a stepped-care model that is being developed at the AdventHealth-Orlando MDC. Caregivers of patients will be referred to the FL REACH intervention for foundational training and skills-development.</description>
