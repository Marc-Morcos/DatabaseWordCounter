  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease characterised by&#xD;
      a variable combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar impairment and autonomic dysfunction. The&#xD;
      neuropathological hallmark is the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in oligodendrocytes. While&#xD;
      some symptomatic treatments exist, neuroprotective treatments for MSA remain an urgent, unmet&#xD;
      need. Moreover, at present there is not a single surrogate biomarker of MSA which could be&#xD;
      used to inform clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to characterise the natural history of MSA on a panel of candidate&#xD;
      biomarkers, pre-selected for being putative surrogates of the underlying neurodegenerative&#xD;
      process&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surrogate biomarkers are objectively measured characteristics of a disease which act as&#xD;
      indicators of the underlying pathophysiological processes responsible for disease&#xD;
      progression. Reduced grey matter volume in putamen, cerebellum and brainstem as measured with&#xD;
      MRI have been consistently reported to differentiate MSA from other parkinsonian disorders.&#xD;
      However, to date, there are no longitudinal studies examining the natural history of MSA on&#xD;
      these structural neuroimaging markers over time. The magnitude of the abnormalities observed&#xD;
      cross-sectionally in MSA compared to other parkinsonian disorders and the fast clinical&#xD;
      progression of the disease make it very likely that structural changes can be observed even&#xD;
      over short periods of time. There is also a strong scientific rationale for the potential of&#xD;
      measures reflecting white matter integrity, cerebral iron deposition and presynaptic&#xD;
      dopaminergic dysfunction, as well as levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL),&#xD;
      alpha-synuclein and other proteins involved in the neurodegenerative process in MSA, to serve&#xD;
      as progression biomarkers of the disease, although supporting evidence remains limited. A&#xD;
      better understanding of the natural history of MSA over 6 and 12 months on a panel of&#xD;
      candidate surrogate biomarkers is needed to better understand the disease, help optimise&#xD;
      future trial designs in terms of patient selection, sample size and trial duration, and&#xD;
      improve the ability to measure the therapeutic effects of novel treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In evaluating potential progression markers of a neurodegenerative disease such as MSA, it is&#xD;
      important to control for the normal effects of aging. Studies in healthy volunteers have&#xD;
      shown regionally distinct effects of aging on both brain volume and dopamine transporter&#xD;
      density, justifying the inclusion of healthy controls with a similar age and gender&#xD;
      distribution than patients.&#xD;
