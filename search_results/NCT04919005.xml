  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research was carried out with the objective of verifying the possibility of intervention&#xD;
      through cognitive training protocols to assist in the stimulation of neurons and to delay the&#xD;
      degradation resulting from Alzheimer's disease in its initial phase. The specific objective&#xD;
      of this research was to develop and validate a virtual environment of games (called&#xD;
      SorrisoTur) that allows the intervention of cognitive training.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SorrisoTur encompasses cognitive training concepts and protocols in playful situations, which&#xD;
      were coded in the form of 2D mini-games that are run on a computer connected to the Web, and&#xD;
      designed to stimulate cognitive domains, such as memory, executive functions, spatial-visual&#xD;
      skills, language (expression, comprehension, reading, and writing) and personality/behavior.&#xD;
      For the comparison of results, three groups were created; one group of elderly people with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease at an early stage, one group formed by healthy elderly, and another group&#xD;
      with young people and applied Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Wechsler Intelligence&#xD;
      Scale for Adults (WAIS-III) before and after of interventions with the games.&#xD;

    <description>The WAIS-III is an intellectual assessment that aims to analise the measures of the following Factorial Scales and Indexes: Verbal IQ (intelligence quotient), Execution IQ, Total IQ, Verbal Understanding Index, Perceptual Organization Indexes, Operational Memory Indexes and Processing speed index.</description>

    <description>The MMSE is a data collection instrument widely used in cases of dementia, it evaluates temporal and spatial orientation, short-term memory (immediate or attention) and skills of evocation, calculation, praxis, visuospatial, communication and language.</description>

    <description>The Virtual Environment was called SorrisoTur and consists of 10 mini-games with difficulty levels in a limited number of cities and mini-games distributed in a thematic scenario of the map of Brazil. The virtual environment consists of the cognitive training mini-games within a theme for all screens, mini-games, and information. The interventions with the Virtual Environment were administered in periods of one hour, twice a week, for a month.</description>
