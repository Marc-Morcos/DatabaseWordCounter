  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease. Numerous studies have reported that&#xD;
      β-amyloid (Aβ) is an important marker for the diagnosis of AD. 18F-92 molecular probe is a&#xD;
      novel molecularly targeted imaging agent, which can rapidly penetrate the blood-brain barrier&#xD;
      and has high affinity and selectivity for Aβ protein. In this study, 18F-92 PET/CT was used&#xD;
      to monitor the regional distribution and the degree of deposition in patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease, and compared with clinical symptoms (neuropsychometry) to evaluate its&#xD;
      application value in the diagnosis of AD.&#xD;

      Healthy volunteers as well as patients meeting Alzheimer's criteria will be recruited for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use PET/CT imaging technology to scan each participant's whole body or head and&#xD;
      collect image data for analysis to evaluate the distribution and metabolism of 18F-92 in the&#xD;
      subject's body. Time from drug injection to scan completion is approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
