  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ECOCAPTURE@HOME is a study which is currently being developed with the objective to capture&#xD;
      the behavioral signature of apathy in everyday life context through remote monitoring of&#xD;
      participants' behavior for about one month. Participants will not only be patients with&#xD;
      apathy but also their spouse caregiver. Behavioral markers of apathy will be extracted from a&#xD;
      combination of: 1/ objective physiological data from sensors on a bracelet worn by&#xD;
      participants; 2/ subjective data filled by the caregiver through an application. Thus&#xD;
      investigators will collect a pool of metrics and show they can measure three assumed&#xD;
      behavioral markers of apathy (daytime activity, quality of sleep and emotional arousal),&#xD;
      which in turn allow to predict caregiver's perception of the dyad's psychological state. The&#xD;
      final goal is to lay the foundations for the development of a clinical tool for the remote&#xD;
      follow-up of patient-caregiver couples.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apathy, a common neuropsychiatric symptom associated with dementia, has a strong impact on&#xD;
      both patients' and caregivers' quality of life. In spite of its debilitating consequences,&#xD;
      apathy is still poorly understood and hard to define or measure objectively. The overall&#xD;
      objective of the ECOCAPTURE programme is to define a precise behavioural signature of apathy,&#xD;
      assessed by a multi-modal and ecological approach. This protocol called &quot;ECOCAPTURE@HOME&quot;&#xD;
      aims to validate a novel method for the remote measurement of behavioural markers of apathy.&#xD;
      The final purpose of such a protocol being to improve the diagnosis and long-term follow-up&#xD;
      of apathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to recruit 60 couples aged between 40 and 85 years old and divided into&#xD;
      three groups of dyads: one group of 20 patient-caregiver dyads in which patients suffer from&#xD;
      the behavioral variant of Fronto-Temporal Dementia (bvFTD), one group of 20 patient-caregiver&#xD;
      dyads in which patients suffer from Alzheimer Disease (AD) and one group of 20 healthy&#xD;
      control couples. All recruited dyads will be followed in their everyday life for 28&#xD;
      consecutive days via a multi-sensor wearable bracelet (worn by both partners of the dyad)&#xD;
      collecting passive behavioural data. Active behavioural data will also be collected using&#xD;
      questionnaires available on a smartphone application (completed by caregiver in&#xD;
      patient-caregiver dyads). Investigators will thus validate a measurement model for three&#xD;
      theoretical behavioural markers of apathy (i.e., daytime activity, quality of sleep and&#xD;
      emotional arousal) using a pool metrics extracted from passive behavioural data&#xD;
      (acceleration, electrodermal activity and blood volume pulse) completed by active behavioural&#xD;
      data (describing behaviour at meals, wake and bedtime). Moreover, investigators will&#xD;
      investigate this measurement model on both a daily and a monthly scale and will attempt to&#xD;
      show that the measured behavioural markers of apathy can predict caregiver's perception of&#xD;
      the dyad's psychological state (collected through questionnaires) on these two time-scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project carries great potential to improve both patients' care and caregivers' social&#xD;
      support.&#xD;

    <description>The secondary outcome measures will be collected through questionnaires completed by the caregiver (only in patient-caregiver dyads) using a smartphone application. For the measure of patient's apathy perceived by caregiver on a day scale (once a week), caregivers have to complete one question: &quot;How did you perceive your partner's level of apathy (= lack of ability to initiate activities) during the day?&quot; using a visual analogue scale from &quot;Very low&quot; to &quot;Very high&quot;.</description>

For the measure of patient's apathy perceived by caregiver on the month scale (at the end of the 28 days of follow-up), investigators use a validated questionnaire: Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS) in caregiver's version (Starkstein et al., 1992). SAS score varies between 0 and 42, higher score meaning higher apathy.</description>

    <description>The secondary outcome measures will be collected through questionnaires completed by the caregiver (only in patient-caregiver dyads) using a smartphone application. For the measure of caregiver's quality of life on a day scale (once a week), caregivers have to complete one question: &quot;How did you perceive your overall health state (physical and psychological) during the day?&quot; using a visual analogue scale from &quot;Very bad health state&quot; to &quot;Very good health state&quot;.</description>

    <description>The secondary outcome measures will be collected through questionnaires completed by the caregiver (only in patient-caregiver dyads) using a smartphone application. For the measure of caregiver's quality of life on the month scale (at the end of the 28 days of follow-up), investigators use a validated questionnaire: Short Form 36 (SF36) (Stewart, 2007). The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores on a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
