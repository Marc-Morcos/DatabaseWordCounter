  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to conduct research and a pilot study to demonstrate the&#xD;
      potential clinical impact and technical feasibility of a socially-assistive robot, called&#xD;
      Ryan Companionbot (hereafter Ryan), for life improvement and intervention of persons with&#xD;
      early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD related dementia (ADRD). Earlier phases of this&#xD;
      project demonstrated the feasibility and scalability of using emotion recognition technology&#xD;
      based on cutting-edge natural language processing and artificial intelligence technologies to&#xD;
      improve mood and lessen depression symptoms of persons with early stage AD/ADRD. In this&#xD;
      phase, the investigators will utilize an aesthetically pleasing updated Ryan (V2.0) with&#xD;
      emotion recognition and natural language processing for enhanced conversations to address the&#xD;
      needs of the individuals with AD/ADRD and their healthcare providers as well as to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Ryan by comparing participants pre- and post-treatment by analyzing several&#xD;
      blood biomarkers related to AD/ADRD and depression. The investigators will recruit thirty&#xD;
      participants from local senior living facilities based on their cognitive performance as&#xD;
      assessed by the Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) score. SLUMS is commonly used as&#xD;
      a simple screening/assessment test in senior living facilities. As part of the recruitment,&#xD;
      the investigators will show prospective participants a video recording of a previous senior&#xD;
      volunteer interacting with Ryan to give new recruits an idea of the socially assistive robot&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;

    <description>Levels of Amyloid-beta will be analyzed from blood collected at time of study. Amyloid-beta peptide is believed to drive Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and is the main component of amyloid plaques.</description>

    <description>Levels of Phospho-tau will be analyzed from blood collected at time of study. In Alzheimer's disease, tau instead of stabilizing microtubules detach from them and form tangles in the neurons.</description>

    <description>Levels of BDNF will be analyzed from blood collected at time of study. BDNF is believed to be decreased in patients experiencing depression.</description>

    <description>Levels of Serotonin will be analyzed from blood collected at time of study. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that has been linked to depression when depleted.</description>

    <measure>SLUMS score</measure>
    <time_frame>The Saint Louis University Mental Status exam will be administered three times during the 8-10 week period. It is a 11 set questionnaire that is scored between 1 and 30 points. A higher score is a better outcome.</time_frame>

    <measure>PHQ-9</measure>
    <time_frame>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 will be administered three times during the 8-10 week period. The score is between 0 and 27. Each questions is scored between &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). A higher score is a worse outcome.</time_frame>
