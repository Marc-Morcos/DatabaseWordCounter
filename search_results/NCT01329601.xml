      The study aims to detect the effect of a structured cognitive rehabilitation program, teh&#xD;
      stage specific intervention STACog, on cognitive performance and functional activation in&#xD;
      fMRI in a group of patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease compared to a waiting group control sample. Baseline performance in cognitive tests&#xD;
      and fMRI will further be assessed compared to healthy control subjects.&#xD;

      Subject of the proposed project is to offer based on existing theoretical principles and&#xD;
      methods stage-related, reproducible, relevant to everyday life group training in German for&#xD;
      people with aMCI and slightly severe AD and compared with a - in terms of goal variables - to&#xD;
      be less effective prestigious intervention . It is believed that the &quot;active treatment&quot; - in&#xD;
      the intervention group, the overall level of functioning can longer be maintained and that&#xD;
      positive transfer effects on non-cognitive level - to achieve and cognitive level - here at&#xD;
      nationals. In addition, information is expected that the conversion rate of people with&#xD;
      dementia and aMCI cut to a further loss of independence in humans can be delayed slightly&#xD;
      with severe AD. The project aims to provide data to estimate the effect sizes of intervention&#xD;
      can be determined on the basis of group size and duration of ongoing investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Involving functional imaging measures, the intervention study, an adequate platform for the&#xD;
      detection of intervention effects on neurobiological basis using fMRI dar. Here, the cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow in specific activation as a measure of neuronal and synaptic activity and&#xD;
      integrity both in cross-section of a subsample of healthy elderly people studied determined&#xD;
      and changes in cerebral activity patterns in people with severe AD, aMCI or slightly in&#xD;
      comparison pre-/post interventions. There are detectable much earlier in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      functional changes as structural, using fMRI, the study is to make a significant contribution&#xD;
      to prove whether a modular cognitive intervention altered neural and synaptic activity and&#xD;
      whether this change is accompanied by an improvement in cognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete and proven effectiveness of cognitive group training could make a significant&#xD;
      contribution that people with MCI and severe AD easily submit their own initiative mental&#xD;
      condition, and add itself to sustain the intellectual, emotional and social potential. As a&#xD;
      long-term perspective, the results for the optimization of cognitive intervention programs&#xD;
      and continue to implement the organizations of the open and contribute stationary the elderly&#xD;
      and specialized medical facilities and other medical facilities.&#xD;
