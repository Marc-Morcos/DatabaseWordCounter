      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a brain disease that impairs memory, cognitive abilities and&#xD;
      the ability to function independently. It is the most common cause of dementia in older&#xD;
      people. It is caused by abnormal proteins in the brain that affect how neurons communicate&#xD;
      with each other. Researchers are looking for drugs that can slow down the disease or treat&#xD;
      its symptoms. One drug, called bisnorcymserine (BNC), may help improve brain function and&#xD;
      symptoms in people with AD. BNC is designed to block a chemical that affects how neurons&#xD;
      communicate with each other. Researchers want to see how BNC works in healthy older&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To look at how the body processes bisnorcymserine taken by mouth and how safe it is for&#xD;
      healthy older volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers at least 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood and urine&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 3 weeks from the screening visit, participants will come to the National&#xD;
           Institute on Aging clinical unit for a 2-night stay. On the morning of the second day,&#xD;
           they will take either a BNC capsule or a placebo. They will not know which tablet they&#xD;
           are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be collected frequently throughout the second and third days of the&#xD;
           study visit. The last blood sample will be collected about 32 hours after taking the&#xD;
           study capsule. Participants will have heart function tests and other exams during the&#xD;
           visit. Once the tests are done, they will leave the clinical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a final follow-up visit about 1 week after leaving the clinical&#xD;
           center.&#xD;

      Objective: Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impairs&#xD;
      memory and other cognitive abilities, as well as behavior and the ability to function&#xD;
      independently. It is the most common cause of dementia among older people. Alzheimer s&#xD;
      disease is characterized by deficits in several neurotransmitter systems, most prominently&#xD;
      acetylcholine (Ach). The cholinergic deficit in the AD brain is associated with the cognitive&#xD;
      and functional symptoms in AD. Restoring this deficit in the cholinergic system is one proven&#xD;
      approach for symptomatic treatment in AD. The action of Ach in the brain is terminated mainly&#xD;
      by two enzymes called cholinesterases (ChEs): acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and&#xD;
      butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Inhibitors of these enzymes therefore augment the activity of&#xD;
      surviving Ach neurons in AD. All ChEs inhibitors currently approved for the treatment of AD&#xD;
      mainly inhibit AChE and, secondarily and to a varying extent, BChE. Reversible and&#xD;
      brain-specific BChE inhibitors have been developed as a class of drugs called cymserine&#xD;
      analogs. Scientists at the NIA/NIH have developed a novel BChE inhibitor called&#xD;
      Bisnorcymserine (BNC). Pre-clinical evidence suggests that BNC may be a safe treatment for&#xD;
      Alzheimer s disease. Based on this, we propose this first-in-human study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single doses of BNC tartrate administered&#xD;
      orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy volunteers aged 55 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Double blind placebo-controlled Phase I clinical Trial of single oral doses of BNC&#xD;
      doses in an ascending schedule: 20, 40mg, 80 mg, 120 mg, 160 mg, 270 mg and 380 mg. Each dose&#xD;
      will be tested in groups of 8 subjects. Six subjects in each cohort will receive active drug&#xD;
      and two will receive placebo. Subjects will be kept in the unit and followed clinically and&#xD;
      with laboratory tests for adverse effects for 32 hours; they will return for a follow-up&#xD;
      visit to assess safety in about 7 days. A Data Safety Monitoring Board will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability associated with each dose level before the next higher dose is tested&#xD;
      in a new cohort. All research will be performed at the National Institute on Aging (NIA)&#xD;
      Clinical Research Unit located on the 5th floor of MedStar Harbor Hospital.&#xD;
