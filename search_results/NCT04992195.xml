  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Safe and effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines may&#xD;
      reduce the transmission of and achieve population immunity against the COVID-19 pandemic,&#xD;
      which accounted for more than 3.75million deaths worldwide. With World Health Organization's&#xD;
      (WHO) effort on ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, vaccination rate may increase&#xD;
      in the near future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, vaccination hesitancy has emerged as a major hindrance on the global&#xD;
      vaccination campaigns in certain areas due to safety concerns, social factors, and public&#xD;
      health policies. For instance, a recent survey conducted in Hong Kong showed a low vaccine&#xD;
      acceptance rate of 37%. Long-term safety concerns and post-vaccination events relayed by the&#xD;
      social media maybe reasons for vaccination hesitancy. Among which, cerebrovascular accidents&#xD;
      (CVA) after vaccination were one of the most frequently reported post-vaccination events.&#xD;
      These reports ranged from ischemic strokes in elderly patients with multiple cardiovascular&#xD;
      co-morbidities, to hemorrhage strokes in otherwise &quot;young-and-fit&quot; adults. While many of&#xD;
      these events were investigated by the COVID-19 immunization expert committee, an important&#xD;
      premise to address the apprehension of CVA after vaccination is the provision of&#xD;
      evidence-based information of the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on brain health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective, longitudinal, observational study, we aim to elucidate the relationship&#xD;
      between COVID-19 vaccines and cerebrovascular health in healthy citizens in a&#xD;
      population-based cohort.&#xD;

      We shall recruit all consecutive citizens from a prospective, population-based cohort from&#xD;
      the CUHK Brain Health Longitudinal Study free of clinically evident neurological diseases.&#xD;
      The CUHK Brain Health Longitudinal Study cohort comprises of an epidemiologically&#xD;
      representative sample from all socio-economic classes in the 18 districts of Hong Kong with&#xD;
      reference to government census data. All citizens received baseline cognitive assessment and&#xD;
      evaluation of metabolic risk factors. Baseline micro- and macro-cerebrovascular abnormalities&#xD;
      were evaluated by MRI brain on recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We shall phone contact the citizens who met the inclusion criteria to enquire their&#xD;
      vaccination plan. Citizens who received COVID-19 vaccination (SinoVac or BioNTech) and&#xD;
      willing to join the study, our services coordinator, co-investigator or principal&#xD;
      investigator will interview and explain the study in details and obtain the participant's&#xD;
      consent. After signing the consent, the participant shall undergo a 2nd MRI brain 16 weeks&#xD;
      (+/-4 weeks) after the 2nd dose of vaccination. The control group is defined as citizens who&#xD;
      have not received any COVID-19 vaccines nor clinically/serologically evident SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We shall collect the following information for the vaccination group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data ; Medical co-morbidities ; Laboratory tests at baseline and 16 weeks (+/-4&#xD;
      weeks) after 2nd dose of vaccine and serological testing for IgG antibody. We shall conduct a&#xD;
      face-to-face assessment 16 weeks (+/-4 weeks) after the 2nd dose of COVID-vaccine for&#xD;
      evaluation of any clinical events, followed by a phone visit every 6 months. Cognitive&#xD;
      assessment by MoCA will be performed at baseline, 16 weeks (+/-4 weeks) then every 12 months&#xD;
      after the 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, we shall collect the following information for the control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data ; Medical co-morbidities ; Laboratory tests at baseline and serological&#xD;
      testing for Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to exclude past COVID-19 infection prior to the&#xD;
      second MRI brain.The timing of the second MRI brain, laboratory tests, clinical and cognitive&#xD;
      assessment in the control group will be matched with the timing in the vaccination group are&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study does not involve formulating new diagnoses or directly offering treatment&#xD;
      for neurological and/or psychiatric conditions. All patients admitted to PWH or other medical&#xD;
      institutes will be treated according to the standard care at the corresponding institution,&#xD;
      regardless of their decision to participate in this repository. Should results from this&#xD;
      study lead to discovery of one or more factors associated with development of brain disease,&#xD;
      the principal investigators, co-investigators, or study coordinator will inform, counsel and&#xD;
      offer diagnostic and/or therapeutic recommendations to participants accordingly. The&#xD;
      participants may be referred to relevant departments for follow-up clinical visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may reduce the transmission of and achieve population&#xD;
      immunity against the COVID-19 pandemic, which accounted for more than 3.75million deaths&#xD;
      worldwide. However, vaccination hesitancy has emerged as a major hindrance on the global&#xD;
      vaccination campaigns in certain areas due to safety concerns, social factors, and public&#xD;
      health policies. The proposed study will allow us to address the apprehension of&#xD;
      cerebrovascular accidents after vaccination is the provision of evidence-based information of&#xD;
      the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on brain health.&#xD;
