  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most individuals with Alzheimer's or dementia return home, where their care is supported by&#xD;
      family and friends. Although family caring at home is usually rewarding, it is often&#xD;
      challenging, too. The demands and responsibilities of caring for a loved one at home can be&#xD;
      stressful. The actual activities of caregiving vary according to the needs of the individual,&#xD;
      but can include helping with bathing, dressing, eating, and many other activities. Caregivers&#xD;
      must learn care techniques and how to manage changes in roles and lifestyle. While adjusting&#xD;
      to these changes, caregivers may be advised to 'take care' of themselves, but may not receive&#xD;
      guidance or support for doing this. In this study, we are testing a self-care intervention&#xD;
      for older, spouse caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's or dementia to see how helpful the&#xD;
      intervention is in reducing distress and in helping caregivers adopt and maintain healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed an intervention for caregivers that is called Self-Care TALK. The&#xD;
      intervention includes creating a health-promoting, self-care education and support&#xD;
      partnership between caregivers and nurses through the use of weekly telephone conversations.&#xD;
      Each conversation focuses on a health-related topic, such as: healthy habits, building&#xD;
      self-esteem, focusing on the positive, avoiding role overload, communicating, and building&#xD;
      meaning. The conversations follow a basic format, but also are unique to each person.&#xD;
      Participants complete questionnaires before and after the intervention, so that we can test&#xD;
      the effect of participation in Self-Care TALK on caregiver health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know that education and support about self-care can be achieved through partnerships&#xD;
      between family caregivers and health care professionals. Our goal is to build on this&#xD;
      knowledge in testing whether participation in the Self-Care TALK intervention will result in&#xD;
      less distress and better health and well-being for spouse caregivers, compared to caregivers&#xD;
      who receive no additional care beyond usual education and support. In working toward this&#xD;
      goal, we are using a partnership approach, in which nurses and caregivers discuss several&#xD;
      health-related topics and mutually identify creative solutions for caregivers to incorporate&#xD;
      self-care and health-promotion strategies into their daily routines. Promoting healthy&#xD;
      outcomes for caregivers is essential to supporting their personal well-being, and to&#xD;
      fostering their ability to continue home care for their loved one.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Informal caregiving, or providing non-paid assistance for a family member or friend who is&#xD;
      unable to care for self, is challenging and stressful. Caregivers commonly experience&#xD;
      negative psychological, emotional, physical, and social outcomes, including depression,&#xD;
      strain and other disruptions in health and well-being. The overall aim of the study is to&#xD;
      test the effectiveness of a health-promoting self-care education and support partnership&#xD;
      between advanced practice nurses (APNs) and older spouse caregivers, in reducing perceived&#xD;
      caregiving strain and in promoting health. The theory-based, multi-dimensional Self-Care TALK&#xD;
      intervention is provided using a telephone-based approach to facilitate participation among&#xD;
      carers, considering their concurrent responsibilities in the caregiving role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, treatment/comparison, repeated-measures experimental design is used to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the health-promoting treatment (Self-Care TALK) compared to usual care, for&#xD;
      spouse caregivers age 60 and older. Subjects must be living with and caring for the person&#xD;
      with dementia and the dementia diagnosis must have been within 2 years of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects complete questionnaires at baseline (Time 1) before randomization to the treatment&#xD;
      or comparison group. Treatment group subjects receive written materials related to self-care&#xD;
      and health promotion for use during the TALK sessions. Self-Care TALK is implemented through&#xD;
      6 weekly telephone sessions with advanced practice nurses. Sessions focus on several&#xD;
      self-care topics, including: healthy habits, building self-esteem, focusing on the positive,&#xD;
      avoiding role overload, communicating, and building meaning. Basic content is structured, but&#xD;
      conversations are individualized with regard to each person's environment, abilities, and&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects complete questionnaires again at 8 weeks (Time 2), and 24 weeks (Time 3) after&#xD;
      baseline. Treatment group subjects are hypothesized to have lower caregiving strain, higher&#xD;
      perceived health, well-being, and self-efficacy related to health, and less depressive&#xD;
      symptomatology than comparison group subjects. Promoting healthy outcomes for caregivers of&#xD;
      persons with dementia is essential to fostering ability for continued home-based care.&#xD;
      Comparison group subjects receive written materials related to self-care and health promotion&#xD;
      post Time 3.&#xD;
