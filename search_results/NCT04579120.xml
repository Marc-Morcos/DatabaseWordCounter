  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the structure and function of the brain in&#xD;
      healthy aging and early Alzheimer's disease using positron emission tomography (PET),&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) imaging. The study involves&#xD;
      imaging the brain to detect the presence of amyloid deposits (plaques in the brain). Amyloid&#xD;
      is a protein that may be related to dementia of Alzheimer's disease (DAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use radioactive tracers called C-11 Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) and F 18/&#xD;
      AV-1451 (Flortaucipir) which binds to beta amyloid and tau in the brain. These compounds are&#xD;
      considered investigational, which means that they have not been approved by the United States&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;

    <ipd_description>We will share imaging data with other researchers. They may be doing research in areas similar to this research or in other unrelated areas. These researchers may be at Washington University, at other research centers and institutions, or industry sponsors of research. We may also share research data with large data repositories (a repository is a database of information) for broad sharing with the research community. If individual research data is placed in one of these repositories only qualified researchers, who have received prior approval from individuals that monitor the use of the data, will be able to look at your information. The shared information will not include names but may be linked by a global unique identifier (GUID) number.</ipd_description>
