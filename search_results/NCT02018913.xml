  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the most common forms of dementia.&#xD;
      Yet, the cause of these diseases is still unknown. A potentially important initiating factor&#xD;
      is a disrupted blood-brain barrier. This can initiate cerebral microangiopathy, which has&#xD;
      frequently been associated with VaD. Nevertheless, also in most AD patients a substantial&#xD;
      increase of vascular damage has been observed. The present study investigates the correlation&#xD;
      between blood-brain-barrier breakdown and cognitive decline in AD and VaD. An innovative&#xD;
      dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan that has recently been developed and tested at our&#xD;
      institute, will be used to measure blood-brain barrier permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: We will investigate the relationship between this permeability measure and (i)&#xD;
      cognitive performance and (ii) the status of MRI visible cerebrovascular pathology (i.e.&#xD;
      white matter hyperintensities, lacunar infarctions, microbleeds) in the most common forms of&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;

        To obtain variation in macrovascular pathology and cognitive outcome measures, patients&#xD;
        with AD, VaD, mixed AD and VaD, mild cognitive impairment (due to AD), vascular cognitive&#xD;
        impairment and subjective cognitive impairment will be included. The total number of&#xD;
        patients is 120, approximately 20 patients per disorder category as mentioned above. The&#xD;
        patients will be recruited from the memory clinic of the Maastricht University Medical&#xD;
        Center. Also a group of 20 age-matched healthy controls will be included. The total number&#xD;
        of participants is thus 140.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent before participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 55 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with AD, VaD, mixed AD and VaD, mild cognitive impairment, vascular&#xD;
             cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MMSE ≥ 20 and patients are mentally competent (in general, individuals with an MMSE&#xD;
             ≥18 are considered mentally competent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent before participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 55 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No Diagnosis of dementia, prodromal dementia, or mild cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MMSE ≥ 26&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No substantial memory complaints (according to participant)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Average age, gender and education is similar to the patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications for scanning (e.g. brain surgery, cardiac pacemaker, metal implants,&#xD;
             claustrophobia, large body tattoos)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications for contrast agent Gadovist (renal failure) as determined by the&#xD;
             estimated Glomular Filtration Rate eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min; or known allergy to Gadovist. If&#xD;
             participants have a low renal function as determined by &lt;30 GFR &lt;60, the PI will&#xD;
             contact a radiologist (Paul Hofman). The radiologist will decide if this patient&#xD;
             should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major vascular disorders (e.g. stroke, heart disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric or neurological disorders: Major depression (&lt; 12 months); history of&#xD;
             schizophrenia; bipolar disorder; psychotic disorder NOS or treatment for a psychotic&#xD;
             disorder (&lt; 12 mnd); cognitive impairment due to alcohol abuse; epilepsy; Parkinson's&#xD;
             disease; MS; brain surgery; brain trauma; electroshock therapy; kidney dialysis;&#xD;
             Meniere's disease; and brain infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Structural abnormalities of the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive impairment due to alcohol/drug abuse or abuse of other substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
