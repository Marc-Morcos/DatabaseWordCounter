  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (AD)&#xD;
      prevalence, incidence, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds&#xD;
      (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged persons) are&#xD;
      under-represented in clinical research. Existing research recruitment approaches are rarely&#xD;
      designed to accommodate the priorities, concerns, and constraints relevant to participants&#xD;
      from diverse backgrounds. To address these gaps, the investigators developed a research&#xD;
      recruitment and engagement model, the Participant Oriented Research Engagement Model that&#xD;
      centers and prioritizes relational aspects of research engagement, research participant&#xD;
      needs, and systematically address socioeconomic determinants (i.e. unmet needs) that may&#xD;
      limit accessibility of research. The investigators propose to test the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Brain Health Community (BHC) Registry recruitment and engagement intervention, as compared to&#xD;
      standard research recruitment strategies in modifying enrollment rates, participant&#xD;
      satisfaction, and engagement. The investigators hypothesize that the BHC Registry will yield&#xD;
      greater enrollment rates, higher satisfaction, and better ratings of relational engagement.&#xD;

      Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (AD)&#xD;
      prevalence, incidence, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds&#xD;
      (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged persons) are&#xD;
      under-represented in clinical research. This poses a major barrier for efforts to better&#xD;
      understand how disease risk factors and protective factors influence ADRD progression, and&#xD;
      determinants of observed disparities. The National Institute on Aging has highlighted the&#xD;
      need for development of an applied recruitment science to advance ADRD research, and enable&#xD;
      systematic investigation of ADRD health disparities. Existing research on optimal ADRD&#xD;
      research recruitment, engagement, and retention strategies is sparse, and focuses&#xD;
      predominantly on individual-level characteristics, many of which may not be modifiable. Much&#xD;
      of this research also overlooks the role of structural and social determinants, along with&#xD;
      features of the study design in shaping participation decisions. People with ADRD and their&#xD;
      caregivers commonly face financial, social, emotional, and logistical (i.e. time scarcity)&#xD;
      consequences in relation to dementia, that disproportionately burden disadvantaged&#xD;
      populations, yet are overlooked in research recruitment and engagement approaches. Existing&#xD;
      research recruitment approaches are rarely designed to accommodate the priorities, concerns,&#xD;
      and constraints relevant to participants from diverse backgrounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these gaps, the investigators developed a research recruitment and engagement&#xD;
      model, the Participant Oriented Research Engagement Model that centers and prioritizes&#xD;
      relational aspects of research engagement, research participant needs, and systematically&#xD;
      address socioeconomic determinants (i.e. unmet needs) that may limit accessibility of&#xD;
      research. Core constructs within the model are implemented within an applied research&#xD;
      recruitment and engagement intervention, the Brain Health Community (BHC) Registry which&#xD;
      applies systematic, tailored, and relational recruitment strategies and standardized&#xD;
      connections to resources as an element of the research engagement process. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to test the effectiveness of the BHC Registry recruitment and engagement&#xD;
      intervention, as compared to standard research recruitment strategies in modifying enrollment&#xD;
      rates, participant satisfaction, and engagement. Each approach will be evaluated in a&#xD;
      randomized trial to either BHC Registry or Standard Recruitment (SR). The relative benefit of&#xD;
      these two approaches will be evaluated in a crossover trial of 60 participants who will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio. The investigators hypothesize that the BHC Registry will yield&#xD;
      greater enrollment rates, higher satisfaction, and better ratings of relational engagement.&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study, participants who received SR will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      the BHC Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To compare the BHC Registry to SR with respect to enrollment factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare the BHC Registry to SR with respect to participant satisfaction and&#xD;
      relational engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis A: Tailored and relational recruitment strategies used in BHC Registry will result&#xD;
      in higher enrollment, lower rates of refusal, and lower drop-out rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis B: Tailored and relational recruitment strategies used in BHC Registry will result&#xD;
      in higher participant satisfaction ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis C: Tailored and relational recruitment strategies used in the BHC Registry will&#xD;
      yield better ratings of relational engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis D: Tailored and relational recruitment strategies used in BHC Registry will result&#xD;
      in more favorable attitudes toward research as assessed by the Clinical Research Involvement&#xD;
      Scale (CRIS)&#xD;
