  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The underlying goal of this study is to assess 123-I AV39 SPECT imaging as a tool to detect&#xD;
      ß-amyloid deposition in the brain of AD research participants and age- and gender-matched&#xD;
      healthy subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 10 healthy controls will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate in this study. Healthy controls will be examined to ensure that&#xD;
      there is no evidence of neurodegenerative changes including cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo written informed consent and a screening evaluation including&#xD;
      baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline physical and neurological evaluation and&#xD;
      baseline cognitive evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to undergo a bolus injection of 123-I AV39. Subjects will undergo&#xD;
      serial SPECT imaging scans and serial venous plasma sampling for measurement of 123-I AV39 in&#xD;
      plasma (both protein bound and free) over a period of up to 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be asked to undergo a second imaging visit between 2 and 6 weeks following the&#xD;
      initial imaging visit following similar procedures to the initial imaging visit to evaluate&#xD;
      the reproducibility of the imaging measure using this procedure. The imaging analyses will be&#xD;
      performed by an image-processing specialist who will remain masked to the procedures employed&#xD;
      with each imaging acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary imaging outcome measure will be the brain regional distribution volumes expressed&#xD;
      as a brain tissue to plasma ratio of the radioligand, 123-I AV39. Time to the peak uptake and&#xD;
      amplitude of the peak uptake will be evaluated for all brain regions and the results for the&#xD;
      AD patients and controls will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those subjects undergoing repeat imaging visits, the data from the initial scan will be&#xD;
      compared to the second scan to determine which offers the reproducibility of the imaging&#xD;
      outcome measure.&#xD;
