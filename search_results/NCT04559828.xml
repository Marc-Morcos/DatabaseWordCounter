  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and its prevalence will&#xD;
      multiply in the coming years, so it is urgent to establish preventive and therapeutic&#xD;
      measures. AD it is characterized by cerebrovascular and parenchymal accumulation of protein&#xD;
      deposits enriched in amyloid-beta (Aβ) as a consequence of alterations of the blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier. More than 60% of plasma Aβ is associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL),&#xD;
      being higher in subjects with AD. Microglia act as resident macrophages and play a crucial&#xD;
      role in most neuropathologies, since it is activated after homeostasis impairment in the&#xD;
      brain, and surrounds amyloid plaques in patients with AD. As a result of microglial&#xD;
      activation, a large number of pro-inflammatory markers are released, mediated by alterations&#xD;
      in the redox state, through the generation of ROS by the complex NADPH oxidase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, the investigators demonstrated in BV-2 cells that artificial TRL are&#xD;
      capable of activating microglia and trigger an inflammatory process. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators showed that some of lipophilic minor components of pomace olive oil&#xD;
      simultaneously modulate oxidative stress and the inflammatory response in microglia. The&#xD;
      investigators suggested that these results should be replicated in humans after consumption&#xD;
      of pomace olive oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in the present study we formulate the hypothesis that human TRL are capable of&#xD;
      activating microglia and that such activation can be attenuated when those particles are&#xD;
      generated after consumption of pomace olive oil. The results of the study would lay the&#xD;
      foundation for the start of clinical trials demonstrating the effect of pomace oil in&#xD;
      reducing the risk of development and progression of AD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In a previous study, the investigators demonstrated that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins&#xD;
      (TRL), which transport dietary lipid components, are able of activating microglia, which&#xD;
      could be associated with the state of neuroinflammation in patients of Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators also demonstrated that some of the minor fat-soluble&#xD;
      components of olive pomace oil simultaneously modulate oxidative stress and the inflammatory&#xD;
      response in microglia, so that these components could have the ability to protect the brain&#xD;
      from microglial overactivation when transported in TRL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In that study, the investigators used artificial TRL that were manufactured ad-hoc in the&#xD;
      laboratory, in order to be able to test the effect of the compounds both individually and&#xD;
      together. Now is the time to consolidate the results using human TRL, obtained after the&#xD;
      consumption of olive pomace oil. The investigators expect that the results of this study will&#xD;
      reveal that the intake of olive pomace oil can prevent the release of inflammatory markers&#xD;
      caused by the overactivation of microglia, which could be associated to a reduction in the&#xD;
      risk of development and progression of Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and design&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, two specific objectives will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To obtain and characterize human TRL obtained after the intake of olive pomace oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the mitigating effect of the microglial activation by TRL obtained after the&#xD;
           intake of olive pomace oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed as a randomized and crossover trial in the postprandial phase in&#xD;
      healthy subjects, which will be divided into two groups to which a pomace oil and high-oleic&#xD;
      sunflower oil will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives set out in the project will be addressed through the execution of the&#xD;
      activities that are detailed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Selection of volunteers and administration of olive pomace oil. 1.1. Obtaining and&#xD;
           characterizing the experimental oils. 1.2. Recruitment and selection of volunteers. 1.3.&#xD;
           Clinical trial in the postprandial phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Isolation and characterization of human TRL. 2.1. General determinations in blood serum.&#xD;
           2.2. Characterization of TRL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Microglial activation in cells treated with human TRL. 3.1. Assays in cell cultures.&#xD;
           3.2. Analytical determinations. 3.3. Data processing and reporting.&#xD;
