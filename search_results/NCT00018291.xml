    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at investigating specific pharmacological interventions in the treatment&#xD;
      of the disruptive, agitated behavior associated with Alzheimer's patients. In addition, it is&#xD;
      hoped that specific clinical profiles will be found to predict which treatment is most&#xD;
      effective for these particular patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, the fourth leading cause of&#xD;
      death, and has enormous economic and emotional costs for caregivers of patients. Most of the&#xD;
      patients with AD develop disruptive, agitated behaviors at some point during the ailment that&#xD;
      are a common catalyst for placement in long-term care settings where they represent more than&#xD;
      half of all the residents. Disruptive behaviors create stress for both staff and patients in&#xD;
      long-term care settings, reduce patient quality of life because of excess use of physical&#xD;
      restraints, and drain the financial resources of the facilities. This study proposes to&#xD;
      design specific interventions designed to decrease disruptive, agitated behavior in patients&#xD;
      with AD residing in long-term care facilities. This 12-week study will assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      two pharmacological agents, an atypical neuroleptic (risperidone) and an anticonvulsant and&#xD;
      mood stabilizer (gabapentin) while identifying moderators of differential treatment response&#xD;
      to the two drugs. Specifically, this study aims to randomize 130 patients with AD who are&#xD;
      manifesting agitated disruptive behavior, into two groups of 65 patients each, with one group&#xD;
      receiving risperidone and the other gabapentin. There are two main hypotheses: 1) Patients in&#xD;
      both of the treatment groups will manifest different overall group decreases in ratings of&#xD;
      disruptive, agitated behavior; and 2) Measurable, clinical characteristics will identify&#xD;
      subgroups of subjects with differential treatment response to the two medications. The two&#xD;
      variables to be considered as moderators are as follows: a) Patients with higher psychosis&#xD;
      ratings will manifest greater responsivity to risperidone compared to gabapentin, and b)&#xD;
      Patients with high levels of affective lability will manifest greater responsivity to&#xD;
      gabapentin compared to risperidone.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of probable AD according to DSM-IV, which show high agreement with&#xD;
             NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al., 1984); kappa = 0.81 (Chui et al., in press).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At least a two-week history of two or more agitated behaviors from the Agitation&#xD;
             Screening Inventory (a shortened version of the 24-item Revised Memory and Behavior&#xD;
             Problem Checklist) (RMBPC; Teri at al., 1992), occurring at least once weekly, and&#xD;
             rated by the caregiver or nursing staff as at least moderately distressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Not planning a change in living situation or placement during the investigational&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Stability (of dose and type) of medications for nonexcluded concurrent medical&#xD;
             conditions (i.e. thyroid disease, anemia, cardiac disease) for four weeks prior to&#xD;
             baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to ingest oral medications and participate in all scheduled evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A sixth grade education or a work history sufficient to exclude mental retardation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. 50 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Medically acceptable for experimental drugs as confirmed by physical evaluation and&#xD;
             laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Modified Hachinski Scale score of 4 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Neurological diagnoses other than AD which affect cognitive function. These include&#xD;
             Parkinson?s Disease, tumors, hydrocephalus, history of significant trauma, and seizure&#xD;
             disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A diagnosis of delirium by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM, Inouye et al., 1990).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A diagnosis of dementia related to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             or amnestic disorder, as defined by DSM-IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known hypersensitivity to risperidone or gabapentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Alcohol or drug abuse within the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;

             mellitus, labile hypertension)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any medical problem that would cause or exacerbate agitated behaviors (including&#xD;
             unstable thyroid dysfunction, electrolyte disturbances, urinary tract infection, fecal&#xD;
             impaction, respiratory disease complicated by hypoxia or hypercapnia, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any psychotropic medications or other medications which may cause or exacerbate&#xD;
             agitated behavior. Patients taking these medications may participate in the study if&#xD;
             the drugs can be successfully discontinued during the washout period and the remainder&#xD;
             of the study, and if after discontinuation they still meet inclusion criteria for the&#xD;
             investigation. Excluded medications include: antipsychotics; antidepressants;&#xD;
             anxiolytics; CNS stimulants; anti convulsants; and sedative hypnotics.&#xD;
