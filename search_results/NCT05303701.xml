  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted by the Sponsor to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GV1001&#xD;
      (0.56 mg and 1.12 mg) administered subcutaneously as a treatment for moderate to severe&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies using in vivo and in vitro AD models have shown that GV1001&#xD;
      inhibits neurotoxicity, apoptosis, and the production of reactive oxygen species induced by&#xD;
      amyloid beta (Aβ) in neural stem cells by mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human&#xD;
      telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). In nonclinical studies, using both mild (early&#xD;
      stage) and severe (late stage) AD mouse models, GV1001 was shown to improve cognitive&#xD;
      function and memory, as well as significantly reduce the amount of Aβ and tau proteins. The&#xD;
      multifunctional effect of GV1001 makes it a promising therapeutic option for the treatment&#xD;
      for AD. In a completed Phase 2 study conducted in Korea, GV1001 showed significant&#xD;
      improvement in change from baseline of Severe Impairment Battery score at Week 24 and&#xD;
      demonstrated a clinically acceptable safety profile in patients with moderate to severe AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel design,&#xD;
      prospective phase 3 study in participants with moderate to severe AD. The study will consist&#xD;
      of a screening visit (up to 14 days prior to first dose), 24-week double-blind treatment&#xD;
      phase, another 24-week open extension phase, and end-of-study (EOS) visits 4 weeks after an&#xD;
      end-of-treatment [EOT] visit at each phase. Eligible participants will be randomized in a&#xD;
      1:1:1 ratio to receive GV1001 0.56 mg, GV1001 1.12 mg, or placebo (normal saline) every week&#xD;
      for 4 weeks beginning on Day 1 (of Week 1) followed by every 2 weeks for 20 weeks during the&#xD;
      double-blind treatment phase. Participants who give consents to enroll in the open extension&#xD;
      phase, will receive GV1001 1.12mg every week for 4 weeks beginning on Day 1 (of Week 26)&#xD;
      followed by every 2 weeks through Week 49. Yet, the group of participants who received GV1001&#xD;
      in the double-blind treatment phase (either 0.56 mg or 1.12 mg) will receive GV1001 1.12mg&#xD;
      and placebo (normal saline) alternately first 4 weeks of the open extension phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization, eligibility of potential participants will be confirmed through an&#xD;
      adjudication process in which screening data (eg, Korea Mini-Mental State Examination&#xD;
      [K-MMSE], Global Deterioration Scale [GDS], MRI/CT scans) obtained to evaluate AD status.&#xD;
      Results from CT or MRI performed within 1 year prior to screening will also be used to&#xD;
      confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant discontinues the study prematurely, the participant will be asked to come&#xD;
      for a drop-out [DO] visit for efficacy evaluation are scheduled at an end-of-study [EOS]&#xD;
      visit at Week 28 or Week 53.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For an individual participant, the maximum duration of study participation is approximately&#xD;
      14 months, including an up to 14-day screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluations will be performed at baseline, 1 Month, 3 Month, 6 Month, 9 Month and 12&#xD;
      Month using the Severe Impairment Battery [SIB] and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of&#xD;
      Boxes [CDR-SOB], K-MMSE, Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire [NPI-Q], GDS, and&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory for Severe&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease [ADCS-ADL-severe]. At the visits where several efficacy assessments are&#xD;
      administered, every effort should be made to perform the efficacy evaluations in the same&#xD;
      order at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring for AEs, laboratory evaluations,&#xD;
      vital signs measurements, and physical assessments.&#xD;
