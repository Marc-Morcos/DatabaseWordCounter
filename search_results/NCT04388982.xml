      Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Exosomes Derived from Allogenic Adipose Mesenchymal Stem&#xD;
      Cells（MSCs-Exos）in Subjects with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, the main pathological characteristics of AD patients are the accumulation of&#xD;
      β-amyloid (Aβ) into senile plaques, the abnormal aggregation of intracellular Tau protein to&#xD;
      form neuron fiber tangles (NFT) and neuron death. There are still no effective treatments to&#xD;
      prevent, halt, or reverse Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exosomes are naturally occurring nanosized vesicles and comprised of natural lipid bilayers&#xD;
      with the abundance of adhesive proteins that readily interact with cellular membranes. These&#xD;
      vesicles have a content that includes cytokines and growth factors, signaling lipids, mRNAs,&#xD;
      and regulatory miRNAs. Exosomes are involved in cell-to-cell communication, cell signaling,&#xD;
      and altering cell or tissue metabolism at short or long distances in the body, and can&#xD;
      influence tissue responses to injury, infection, and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this single center, open label, phase I/Ⅱ clinical trial, therefore, is to&#xD;
      explore the safety and efficacy of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells (MSCs-Exos) in the treatment of mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease.&#xD;
