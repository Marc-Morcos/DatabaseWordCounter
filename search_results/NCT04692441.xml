    <textblock>
      High fat feeding (HFF) increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but individuals who&#xD;
      carry the AD risk gene E4 paradoxically improve after acute HFF. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      further study this phenomenon with a clinical study to assess cerebral blood flow which can&#xD;
      be measured by a technique called arterial spin labeling (ASL) on an MRI and is tightly&#xD;
      related to brain metabolism.&#xD;

      Overview: The purpose of the study is to enroll 90 older adults, half of whom will have E4&#xD;
      carrier status, to assess whether E4 status affects change in global cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      (∆CBF) in response to a high fat drink. The screening visit includes informed consent,&#xD;
      baseline blood draw, oral triglyceride tolerance test (OTTT), and dual-energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DEXA). The study visit involves assessing cerebral blood flow using arterial&#xD;
      spin labeling (ASL) MRI - at baseline and at 2 hours after drinking heavy cream. The study&#xD;
      visit will also include 6 blood draws and a 30 minute cognitive battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit Procedures (at Seattle South Lake Union campus): Before the screening visit,&#xD;
      participants will receive a copy of the consent form in the mail as well as a medical history&#xD;
      questionnaire to fill out. Participants will be advised to fast the night before the&#xD;
      screening visit (minimum 8 hours required). After an informed consent process, study&#xD;
      personnel will check vitals, including waist circumference, height, and weight for body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) calculation. An IV will be placed by the study nurse and blood sent for complete&#xD;
      blood count, chem20 (including liver and kidney function assessment), glycated hemoglobin&#xD;
      (hemoglobin A1C), lipid panel, and a blood sample for APOE genotyping (Northwest Lipids using&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology). Blood samples except APOE will be sent to the&#xD;
      University of Washington (UW) Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified lab,&#xD;
      and participants will receive a copy of the results by mail. After the blood draw,&#xD;
      participants will then undergo an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): 6 time points (0, 15,&#xD;
      30, 45, 60,120 min) which will include a blood draw for plasma to measure insulin and C&#xD;
      peptide (in batches by Northwest (NW) lipids). At time 0 and 120 minutes study personnel will&#xD;
      also assess vitals and a point of care glucose using a glucometer. The OGTT will be the&#xD;
      standard 75 grams glucose drink from central supply. After the 2-hour OGTT is complete,&#xD;
      patients will undergo a DEXA scan. Note, DEXA can be performed before OGTT if needed for&#xD;
      study flow. Parking will be provided, and participants will be paid with a gift card.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit sample day:&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 am: Check in to the clinic 8-8:30: informed consent in private room, go over medical&#xD;
      history 8:30-9: Insert IV, fill out depression, anxiety screen, draw baseline blood 9 -11 am:&#xD;
      OGTT (During gaps in OGTT, do Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) 11-11:25 am: DEXA&#xD;
      11:25-11:30: Remove IV, distribute gift card and parking validation Time: 3.5 hours, total&#xD;
      blood drawn 40 mls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit Procedures (at University of Washington main campus): Participants will arrive to&#xD;
      the UW Translational Research Unit (TRU) after an overnight fast (minimum 8 hours required).&#xD;
      The study nurse will place an IV, and check vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      temperature, and weight. Then, the participant will be escorted to the MRI scanner and&#xD;
      undergo the fasting imaging protocol. The participant will head back to the TRU and start the&#xD;
      oral triglyceride tolerance test (OTTT). Time 0 blood is drawn and time documented. Then, the&#xD;
      participant will drink the dairy product-100 mLs of heavy cream (just under half a cup) which&#xD;
      contains 370 calories, 40.4 grams of total fat, 23.6 grams of saturated fat. The participant&#xD;
      will be encouraged to drink the product over 5 minutes as per published OTTT protocols. Blood&#xD;
      draws will be collected for measurement of glucose, insulin, lipids and appetite hormones&#xD;
      (30, 120, 180, 240 min). A post-lipid MRI will be done at the 2 hour time point, and the NIH&#xD;
      toolbox cognitive assessment will be done at 3 hour time point. The NIH battery takes&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes to administer and will be done on a portable tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit sample day:&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 am: Check in to UW TRU, ask about new medications, place IV 8:15: Escort down to MRI area,&#xD;
      get pre-MRI 8:45: Back at TRU: T0 blood draw 8:45-8:50: Drink lipid 9:20: T30 min blood draw&#xD;
      9:50: T60 min blood draw 10:50: T120 min (2 hour) blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
      **Return to MRI scanner for 2 hour MRI** (will be ~2 hours and 10 minutes post drink) 11:50:&#xD;
      T180 min (3 hour) blood draw **Do the NIH toolbox testing now - takes about 30 minutes**&#xD;
      12:50: T240 min (4 hour) blood draw 12:50-1 pm: Remove IV, receipt of gift card, participant&#xD;
      checks out. Time: 5 hours, total blood drawn: 80 mls (13 per blood draw x 6 time points)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI protocol: The investigator will use pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling to measure&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ml/100g/min as a marker of perfusion for improved signal&#xD;
      quality. In this approach, magnetically labeled arterial blood water serves as the endogenous&#xD;
      contrast. MRI images will be stored on external hard drive with encryption and will be&#xD;
      uploaded to One Drive or another HIPAA-compliant system for further processing and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment: As per the consensus recommendations, the investigator will use a sequence (5.5&#xD;
      minutes) with long label duration = 1.8 s, long post-labeling delay = 2 s, with labeling&#xD;
      offset = 25-30 mm, slices = 20, spatial resolution = 3.5×3.5×5 mm3, field of view =&#xD;
      240×240×100 mm3, SENSE-factor = 2, repetition time/echo time (TR/TE)= 5000/18 ms. Dual&#xD;
      adiabatic background suppression pulses will be applied to minimize gray and white matter&#xD;
      tissue contamination at inversion delay (TI) = 2.05 and 3.25 s. Finally, the investigator&#xD;
      will acquire an equilibrium magnetization scan (M0, 1 minute), identical to the above scan,&#xD;
      but with TR = 10,000 ms and no labeling or background suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: First, motion correction will be applied to the arterial spin labeling images using&#xD;
      motion correction (FSL-MCFLIRT), and these will be registered to the M0 image. Then, the&#xD;
      investigator will perform a pair-wise subtraction between the control and null images and&#xD;
      apply a two-compartment model to quantify CBF. The resulting CBF map will be co-registered to&#xD;
      the T1 scan followed by a transformation to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space.The&#xD;
      temporal regions such as the entorhinal cortex, temporal lobe, hippocampus as well as the&#xD;
      posterior cingulate and lateral parietal lobules will be identified using standard&#xD;
      Harvard-Oxford Cortical and Subcortical atlas. CBF values will be compared in these regions&#xD;
      between the groups. The region of interest approach can dilute effects that are smaller than&#xD;
      the size of the region of interest. Therefore, the investigator will also perform&#xD;
      permutations testing in FSL to evaluate voxel-wise CBF differences between group. In order to&#xD;
      ensure that the voxel-wise outcomes are not mere chance, the investigator will impose strict&#xD;
      family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons.&#xD;
