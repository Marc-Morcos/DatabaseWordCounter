  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) comprise approximately 25%&#xD;
      of hospitalized older adults. These individuals are at increased risk for functional decline,&#xD;
      delirium, falls, behavioral symptoms associated with dementia (BPSD) and longer lengths of&#xD;
      stay. Physical activity during hospitalization (e.g., mobility,bathing, dressing) has a&#xD;
      positive impact on older adults including prevention of functional decline, less pain, less&#xD;
      delirium, less BPSD, fewer falls, shorter length of stay and decreased unplanned hospital&#xD;
      readmissions. Despite known benefits, physical activity is not routinely encouraged and older&#xD;
      hospitalized patients spend over 80% of their acute care stay in bed. Challenges to&#xD;
      increasing physical activity among older patients with ADRD include environment and policy&#xD;
      issues (e.g., lack of access to areas to walk); lack of knowledge among nurses on how to&#xD;
      evaluate, prevent and manage delirium and BPSD; inappropriate use of tethers; beliefs among&#xD;
      patients, families, and nurses that bed rests helps recovery and prevents falls; and lack of&#xD;
      motivation/willingness of patients to get out of bed. To increase physical activity and&#xD;
      prevent functional decline while hospitalized we developed Function Focused Care for Acute&#xD;
      Care (FFC-AC-EIT) for patients with ADRD. Implementation of FFC-AC-EIT changes how care is&#xD;
      provided by having nurses teach, cue, and help patients with ADRD engage in physical activity&#xD;
      during all care interactions. FFC-AC-EIT was developed using a social ecological model,&#xD;
      social cognitive theory and the Evidence Integration Triangle. It involves a four-step&#xD;
      approach that includes: (1) Environment and Policy Assessments; (2) Education; (3)&#xD;
      Establishing Patient Goals; and (4) Mentoring and Motivating of Staff, Patients and Families.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of FFC-AC-EIT within 12 hospitals in&#xD;
      Maryland and Pennsylvania randomized to FFC-AC-EIT or Function Focused Care Education Only&#xD;
      (EO) with 50 patients recruited per hospital (total sample 600 patients). Aim 1 will focus on&#xD;
      efficacy at the patient level based primarily on physical activity, function, and&#xD;
      participation in function focused care, and secondarily on delirium, BPSD, pain, falls, use&#xD;
      of tethers, and length of stay; and all of these outcomes (except length of stay and tethers)&#xD;
      along with emergency room visits, re-hospitalizations and new long term care admissions at 1,&#xD;
      6 and 12 months post discharge; and at the unit level the aim is to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      FFC-AC-EIT on policies and environments that facilitate function and physical activity at 6,&#xD;
      12 and 18 months post implementation. Hospitals randomized to FFC-AC-EIT will be compared&#xD;
      with those randomized to Function Focused Care Education Only (EO). Aim 2 will evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility, based on treatment fidelity (delivery, receipt, enactment)136, and relative cost&#xD;
      and cost savings of FFC-AC-EIT versus EO. Findings will address several prioritized areas of&#xD;
      research: a focus on ADRD; improving physical function; and training of hospital staff and&#xD;
      will demonstrate efficacy of an approach to care for patients with ADRD that can be&#xD;
      disseminated and implemented across all acute care facilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After hospitals are recruited they will be randomized to cohort and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      treatment so that the hospital will receive either FFC-AC-EIT or EO. FFC-AC-EIT is&#xD;
      implemented by a Research Nurse Facilitator working with the stakeholder team and unit&#xD;
      champions for 10 hours weekly during months one and two and then for four hours weekly&#xD;
      starting in month three for a total of 12 months. Timing of the intervention activities will&#xD;
      be flexible based on the needs of the unit. The first meeting with the stakeholder team will&#xD;
      be 1-2 hours and the remaining meetings will be approximately 30 minutes monthly to update&#xD;
      the stakeholders on progress and any challenges associated with implementation of FFC-AC-EIT.&#xD;
      The majority of the time on the unit by the Research Nurse Facilitator will be spent with the&#xD;
      champions helping and assuring that they are engaging staff in function focused care&#xD;
      activities via the four steps of FFC-AC-EIT. Once hospitals are randomized we will set up a&#xD;
      time to meet with the identified contact to determine the stakeholder team members and&#xD;
      champions and organize the first stakeholder team meeting. The first meeting will provide an&#xD;
      overview of the implementation of Steps 1 to 4 [(1) Environment and Policy Assessments; (2)&#xD;
      Education; (3) Establishing Patient Goals; and (4) Mentoring and Motivating of Staff,&#xD;
      Patients and Families] and will address the unit challenges to implementing function focused&#xD;
      care using a Brainstorming approach. In the first two months the Research Nurse Facilitator&#xD;
      completes the environment and policy assessments with the champions and implements&#xD;
      appropriate changes on the units and plans and provides staff education and makes available&#xD;
      information for patients and families/ caregivers. The education reviews function focused&#xD;
      care. Ongoing work between the champions and the Research Nurse Facilitator focuses on&#xD;
      motivating staff and patients to work toward achievement of patient goals and established&#xD;
      unit goals. The stakeholder team will continue to meet with the Research Nurse Facilitator&#xD;
      monthly (approximately 30 minutes) over the 12-month intervention period to review progress&#xD;
      and to help champions overcome any identified multilevel challenges. In addition to monthly&#xD;
      visits, weekly emails containing motivational Tidbits will be sent to all stakeholder team&#xD;
      members within the cohort. The Tidbits include such things as updates about benefits of&#xD;
      engaging patients with ADRD in physical activity while hospitalized. To further facilitate&#xD;
      implementation we will give each treatment site: 1) a 100 dollar gift certificate from Nasco&#xD;
      (Nasco.com) to buy supplies for the unit to engage patients with ADRD in physical activities&#xD;
      (e.g., age-appropriate weights; soft horseshoe toss game); 2) 1000 dollars at the end of the&#xD;
      study for each champion to attend a conference and submit an abstract focused on optimizing&#xD;
      function and physical activity of hospitalized older adults with ADRD. Education Only (EO)&#xD;
      Control Intervention: Hospitals randomized to EO will be provided with an in-service for&#xD;
      nursing staff on function focused care in patients with ADRD by an EO Research Nurse&#xD;
      Facilitator using our developed PowerPoint presentations in 30-minute sessions as is&#xD;
      currently done in usual practice.&#xD;
