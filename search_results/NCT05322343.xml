  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B cube is a new generation cohort to study the determinants and natural history of brain&#xD;
      aging, using molecular epidemiology, in a representative sample (N=2000) of the general&#xD;
      population from the age of 55 (the approximate age of onset of the first cognitive disorders&#xD;
      and a target population particularly receptive to prevention messages). Special interest will&#xD;
      be given to nutrition, a promising environmental exposure for prevention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive aging and associated pathologies, primarily dementia and its main cause Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, are a major public health issue. Because of the under-diagnosis of dementia in the&#xD;
      population and the very long preclinical phase of these diseases, population-based cohorts&#xD;
      are essential to better understand brain aging. With the PAQUID and 3-Cités cohorts, the&#xD;
      Bordeaux Population Health Research Center (BPH) has been a world pioneer in population-based&#xD;
      studies on aging and dementia, and has thus contributed greatly to a better understanding of&#xD;
      age-realted brain diseases. As these cohorts are aging, and in view of the importance of&#xD;
      studying the early stages of brain aging, it seems essential to continue our research efforts&#xD;
      for the prevention of cognitive aging with the establishment of a new cohort of young&#xD;
      seniors. In addition to the population-based design of the study, the representativeness of&#xD;
      the cohort appears to be a crucial issue (since population-based cohorts depend on the&#xD;
      voluntary participation of healthy individuals, unfavorable exposures and altered health&#xD;
      states are often largely under-represented, which reduces the variability of exposures and&#xD;
      events, leading to an underestimation of prevalences, a decrease in statistical power and a&#xD;
      potential bias in the estimation of associations). Finally, the multifactorial nature of&#xD;
      brain ageing pathologies now calls for the replacement of the reductionist approach of risk&#xD;
      factors by a more holistic vision of the exposome (defined as all the environmental exposures&#xD;
      with which an individual is confronted throughout the lifecourse). The development of an&#xD;
      integrated approach of complex, high-dimensional, multi-omics biological data (genomics,&#xD;
      transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, proteomics), applied to various biological&#xD;
      matrices, is an indispensable tool to deep phenotyping and to the establishment of a new&#xD;
      generation etiological epidemiological research framework in the field of brain aging&#xD;
      pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Biobank and Brain health in Bordeaux cohort (B cube) will include the completion of a&#xD;
      general questionnaire (during the V1 visit), a dietary survey (during the V1, V4 and V5&#xD;
      visits), a computerized cognitive battery (during the V1 visit), a collection of biological&#xD;
      material (blood, urine, stool, saliva, hair, nails and nasopharyngeal swab) for the&#xD;
      constitution of a biobank (during the V2 biobank visit, 2000 samples of blood, urine, hair,&#xD;
      nails and 1000 samples expected for the other fluids/samples) An MRI will be performed in&#xD;
      volunteers aged 55 to 70 years (during the V3 visit). Finally, a complementary visit by a&#xD;
      medical specialist may be proposed to participants with cognitive disorders or Parkinson's&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
