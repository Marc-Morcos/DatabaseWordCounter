      This study is intended to examine the impact of learning amyloid brain imaging results among&#xD;
      asymptomatic older adults, and how to safely communicate these results and educate on the&#xD;
      risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a brain disease and is the most common form of dementia. Clinical&#xD;
      trials for the prevention of AD have been moving to enroll subjects at increasingly earlier&#xD;
      time-points, and are now focusing upon individuals who are not only cognitively normal but&#xD;
      also have biomarkers associated with an increased risk of developing AD. Detecting one&#xD;
      specific biomarker on brain scans, i.e. amyloid-beta protein, is currently used to inform&#xD;
      diagnoses in cognitively impaired individuals, and its use may expand to pre-clinical AD&#xD;
      cases as preventive therapies are developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the REVEAL-SCAN clinical trial, the investigators are examining the psychological and&#xD;
      behavioral impact of learning &quot;elevated&quot; and &quot;not elevated&quot; amyloid neuroimaging results&#xD;
      pertaining to the risk of progressing to Alzheimer's disease dementia by age 85 among&#xD;
      cognitively normal older adults. The study's goal is to learn how to communicate these&#xD;
      amyloid brain scan results and the risk of developing AD dementia by age 85 in a diverse&#xD;
      population of cognitively normal older adults. Findings will be relevant to future&#xD;
      decision-making in research trials and clinical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites will enroll older, cognitively normal individuals (approx. 370 total) using APOE&#xD;
      genotyping to enrich the enrollment sample such that roughly 100 of those scanned will have&#xD;
      elevated amyloid brain scan results. From this enriched sample, participants (approximately&#xD;
      25% African-American) will all receive their Alzheimer's Disease Dementia Risk Assessment&#xD;
      based on known risk factors. Half of the participants will be randomized to also learn their&#xD;
      amyloid brain scan result at that time, while the other half will learn their scan result 6&#xD;
      months later. Cognitive, psychological, and behavioral outcomes will be compared between&#xD;
      these two groups. Participants will be followed for up to 9 months with up to 7 in-person&#xD;
      visits and 5 phone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REVEAL-SCAN is the first multisite randomized clinical trial to explore the benefits, risks&#xD;
      and limitations of disclosing amyloid results, and will help researchers and clinicians&#xD;
      understand downstream implications of this emerging technology as it becomes increasingly&#xD;
      utilized to compile comprehensive neuroimaging profiles for older adults at risk for&#xD;
      developing Alzheimer's disease dementia.&#xD;
