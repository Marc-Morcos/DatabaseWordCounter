  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in older adults and has recently been implicated in&#xD;
      pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research has shown that sleep disruptions have&#xD;
      caused memory impairment. Sleep apnea is a form of sleep disruption. We would like to examine&#xD;
      how obstructive sleep apnea may contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: We will assess the endotypes (mechanisms) underlying OSA in elderly individuals known&#xD;
      to be high risk for AD (vs. non-OSA matched controls) using novel recently validated&#xD;
      simplified techniques which do not require burdensome complex overnight experiments to assess&#xD;
      endotypes (primary outcome loop gain). We will further assess the predicted response to O2&#xD;
      therapy in terms of respiratory outcomes among elderly OSA patients with varying levels of&#xD;
      loop gain and pharyngeal collapsibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: A substantial proportion of high AD risk patients with OSA should be O2&#xD;
      responsive as predicted using pathophysiological assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: We will perform an overnight mechanistic study of oxygen therapy vs. room air in high&#xD;
      AD risk patients with OSA (recruited from Aim 1 and others if necessary). Given the frequent&#xD;
      intolerance of PAP in elderly patients, we anticipate that oxygen therapy may be a viable&#xD;
      therapeutic approach in this fragile population. We will focus on respiratory outcomes&#xD;
      (primary outcome: apnea hypopnea index) but also assess sleep dependent memory consolidation&#xD;
      on word pairs task given the major impact in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: O2, compared to room air, will improve OSA and neurocognitive outcomes in&#xD;
      select elderly OSA patients at risk of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Preclinical AD with OSA and non-OSA controls, from Aim 1 will have structural and&#xD;
      molecular brain imaging focusing on hippocampal atrophy as a predictor of memory&#xD;
      consolidation. We will also assess amyloid and tau in the medial temporal region as function&#xD;
      of OSA severity and as a predictor of neurocognitive function. This aim will lay the&#xD;
      groundwork for designing a robust clinical trial using neuroimaging outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Impairment in memory consolidation is a function of hippocampal size in OSA&#xD;
      patients at risk of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: We will perform a pilot randomized trial of oxygen vs. PAP therapy in OSA patients&#xD;
      with preclinical AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: In preclinical AD with OSA, oxygen will be a viable therapeutic strategy to&#xD;
      improve memory.&#xD;

    <measure>Loop Gain (LG)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A method used to measure respiratory stability of the negative feedback chemoreflex control system using a specialized Positive Airway Pressure machine called a pCrit. The overall loop gain of the ventilatory system reflects the ratio of the ventilatory response to the disturbance that elicited the response (LG = ventilatory response/ventilatory disturbance). The higher the loop gain, the potentially more unstable the respiratory control system becomes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Apnea Hypopnea Index</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The number of times a person stops breathing and periods of shallow breathing with a marked decrease in blood oxygen concentration every hour on average. A score lower than five indicates normal sleep (no sleep apnea), 5-15 indicates mild sleep apnea, 15-30 indicates moderate sleep apnea, and a score greater than 30 indicates severe sleep apnea.</description>

    <measure>Neuroimaging</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>MRI and PET Scans. This study will examine pre-clinical AD with OSA patients using brain imaging (structural MRI and amyloid/tau PET). MRI will be conducted to provide a structural image suitable for coregistering the PET image and observing white matter integrity. The scan should take 35 minutes. These will be MPRAGE images collected using the standard ADNI protocol at the in-house 3T MRI scanner at the UCSD Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute (ACTRI). The PET scan should take 70-90 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person's average sleep propensity in daily life.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 19-item, self-rated questionnaire designed to measure sleep quality and disturbance over the past month. The sleep component scores are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 21 with the higher total score (referred to as global score) indicating worse sleep quality.</description>
