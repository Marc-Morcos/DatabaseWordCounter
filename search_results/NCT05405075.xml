      The Arizona Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) is the National Institute on Aging's&#xD;
      (NIA's) first statewide AD Center (ADC), the only ADC in the Southwestern United States, and&#xD;
      a leading example of statewide collaboration in biomedical research. It capitalizes on&#xD;
      Arizona's strengths in brain imaging, genomics, computer science and biomathematics, the&#xD;
      basic, cognitive and behavioral neurosciences, clinical, and neuropathological studies of AD,&#xD;
      the discovery and evaluation of investigational treatments, and the study of normal cognitive&#xD;
      aging.&#xD;

    <description>The ADRC uses a prospective, standardized, and longitudinal clinical evaluation of participants to determine their cognitive status. This includes tests that assess short and long term memory, ability to complete daily tasks, and processing of information.</description>

        The Clinical Core maintains a target of 550 participants at all stages of the&#xD;
        aging-dementia spectrum including 400 normal controls and 150 participants with MCI,&#xD;
        probable AD dementia and other dementias. Embedded within these diagnostic categories are&#xD;
        defined Latino and Native American cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be referred to the ADRC from varying sources including, but not limited&#xD;
        to, clinic referrals, community outreach programs, general advertising, national&#xD;
        registries, and other sites within the consortium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants eligible for enrollment and those completing annual follow-up are discussed in&#xD;
        frequent diagnostic consensus conferences. All undergo a standardized neuropsychological&#xD;
        and neurological battery of tests at entry and annual tests at all sites.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitively normal persons, individuals with mild cognitive impairment or dementia who&#xD;
             are at least 40 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to undergo health and cognitive assessments, and collection and banking of&#xD;
             blood with venipuncture for genetic research, biomarker research, and DNA banking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Participants whose diagnosis is unclear and confounded by multiple possible factors&#xD;
             are excluded. Participants with diagnoses of non-AD dementias are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Participants whose primary diagnosis is cognitive impairment due to a penetrating&#xD;
             or single severe closed head injury, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor, metabolic or&#xD;
             toxic encephalopathy, post-infectious (e.g., viral encephalitis, bacterial&#xD;
             meningitis), paraneoplastic, primary psychiatric illness, or otherwise not deemed&#xD;
             relevant to the intent of the Alzheimer Disease Center program are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Procedure specific exclusion criteria also apply but this does not impact the&#xD;
             participants ability to be included in the study.&#xD;
