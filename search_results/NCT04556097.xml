  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing need for to provide high quality care for persons living with dementia&#xD;
      (PLWD) and provide support for care partners in the primary care setting. The Care Ecosystem&#xD;
      model is a telephone-based dementia care program that provides standardized, proactive,&#xD;
      personalized, and scalable support and education for care partners. The Care Ecosystem model&#xD;
      has demonstrated an improvement in patient quality of life, reduced unnecessary healthcare&#xD;
      expenditures, and a decrease in care partner burden and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot the investigators will assess the feasibility of implementing and measuring&#xD;
      outcomes of an adapted Care Ecosystem training model for primary care nurse managers serving&#xD;
      a diverse panel of PLWD and their care partners in primary care practices participating in&#xD;
      the Mass General Brigham healthcare system's Integrated Care Management Program in Boston,&#xD;
      MA. The study team will leverage the Mass General Brigham electronic medical record to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of collecting the primary clinical outcome defined as emergency&#xD;
      department visits among the PLWD cared for by the primary care practices. The investigative&#xD;
      team will also assess the feasibility of implementation, number of contacts between nurse&#xD;
      care managers and care partners, and documented advance care planning.&#xD;

    <description>Nurse care managers will be randomized to either early or delayed adapted Care Ecosystem training. The Early Training arm will be the first group to receive training and the first to have the opportunity to use the training in a clinical setting. We anticipate that each nurse care manager will manage 10 PWLD and we anticipate a 50% response rate/data availability, yielding 75 patients per arm.</description>

    <description>The Care Ecosystem model uses a telephone-based intervention to support persons with dementia and their care partners, screening for common dementia-related problems and providing modular standardized support protocols and caregiver education. Specially trained health care navigators systematically identify needs and address health status, advance care planning, medication management and management of challenging behaviors. Health care navigators receive backup support from a nurse, social worker, dementia specialist, and pharmacist, and maintain close communication with the primary care provider of the persons with dementia.&#xD;
This Care Ecosystem model will be adapted to augment the dementia care provided by experienced Integrated Care Management Program nurse care managers engaged in the care of high-risk, high-cost patients in a large health system.</description>
