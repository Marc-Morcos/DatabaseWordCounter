  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of dementia is rapidly growing worldwide, affecting 46.8 million people in&#xD;
      2015. The 2014 Alzheimer's Society report estimated that 311,730 people with dementia were&#xD;
      living in care homes in the United Kingdom (UK). In care homes, people are more likely to be&#xD;
      socially isolated and experience a lack of stimulation. It has been argued that access to&#xD;
      meaningful activities is of high importance. One strategy that may engage older people in&#xD;
      enjoyable leisure activities is the use of touchscreen technology. Previous research has&#xD;
      indicated that people with dementia and care staff reported positive experiences when using&#xD;
      touchscreen technology, showing improvements in quality of life, relationships and&#xD;
      interpersonal interaction. A possible way to engage people with dementia with touchscreen&#xD;
      technology could be through the use of the visual arts. Preliminary evidence shows the use of&#xD;
      arts with this population to be beneficial in reducing behavioural symptoms, depression and&#xD;
      isolation and make people with dementia more able to express feelings. The use of visual art&#xD;
      activities in touchscreen technology is a promising idea, as positive results from&#xD;
      interventions using these activities independently can be found in scientific literature.&#xD;
      This intervention will consist of the use of two different visual art apps on touchscreen&#xD;
      tablets with people with dementia living in care homes. Study data collection will take 8&#xD;
      weeks; four weeks will involve the execution of the intervention and four weeks for&#xD;
      measurements. Participants will be supported to use the app twice-weekly, with a maximum of 8&#xD;
      individual sessions. So far, very little research on the benefits of visual art interventions&#xD;
      on touchscreen devices has been made. Thus, there is a need to have more research on this&#xD;
      topic. This study will add to research on this field, and its results could be valuable to&#xD;
      care staff and people with dementia.&#xD;

      SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with dementia that live in care homes are more prone to experience a lack of&#xD;
      stimulation and be socially isolated. Activities that are likely to be beneficial for people&#xD;
      with dementia are social and leisure activities, as the activities promote engagement and&#xD;
      improve affect. It has been argued that these activities should be of high importance in care&#xD;
      settings and that care home residents living with dementia should have access to meaningful&#xD;
      activities and are supported when engaging with the activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of touchscreen technology is one strategy that may possibly engage older people in&#xD;
      enjoyable leisure activities. In past research, people with dementia and staff reported&#xD;
      positive experiences with the use of technology in previous research that evaluate the&#xD;
      impacts of touchscreen technology in care homes. This same research also showed supportive&#xD;
      evidence for the positive contribution of the touchscreen technology for improvements in&#xD;
      quality of life, relationships and interpersonal interactions. A literature review from 2017&#xD;
      on the use of touchscreen technology by people with dementia and its impact on wellbeing also&#xD;
      shows supportive evidence for the use of touchscreen technology in dementia care. The&#xD;
      researchers concluded that touchscreen-based interventions could provide benefits on mood,&#xD;
      mental health, social interaction, quality of interaction, and sense of mastery. If people&#xD;
      with dementia have the appropriate support for the use of touchscreen technology, it is&#xD;
      evidently possible for people to benefit from its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possible way to engage people with dementia with touchscreen technology could be through&#xD;
      the use of the visual arts. Preliminary evidence shows that use of arts for people with&#xD;
      dementia appears to be beneficial in reducing behavioural symptoms, depression and isolation&#xD;
      and make people with dementia more able to express feelings. The use of visual art activities&#xD;
      in touchscreen technology is a promising idea, as positive results from interventions using&#xD;
      these activities separately can be found in scientific literature. So far, very little&#xD;
      research on the benefits of visual art interventions on touchscreen devices has been made.&#xD;
      Thus, there is a need to have more research on this topic. This study will add to research on&#xD;
      this field and its results could be valuable to care staff and people with dementia.&#xD;
      Providing people with dementia a set of exciting activities which have the potential to&#xD;
      enrich people lives and be beneficial for wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention activity will consist of the use of two different visual art apps on&#xD;
      touchscreen tablets with people with mild to moderate dementia that lives in care homes. The&#xD;
      study will take place in a nursing home in Nottinghamshire. It will involve 12 residents of&#xD;
      the care home with dementia and staff members that are involved in participants' care.&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified by the care home staff, and staff members will&#xD;
      indicate these people to the research team. Study data collection will take 8 weeks; four&#xD;
      weeks will involve the execution of the intervention and four weeks for additional&#xD;
      measurements (collect consent, screening and end measures). Given the nature of the&#xD;
      intervention, no practical control condition would be a reasonable comparison for this&#xD;
      intervention. Thus, the use of a cross-over design is a suitable control condition to be used&#xD;
      in this study. Participants will be split into two groups of 6 participants; each group will&#xD;
      use one app for two weeks and then change to the other app for another 2 weeks. Participants&#xD;
      will be supported to use the app twice a week, with a maximum of 8 individual sessions over&#xD;
      the four weeks. The data collection will consist of the observation of the activity and on&#xD;
      the use of dementia-specific instruments and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to explore the supported use of two digital art apps in a participatory&#xD;
      artistic activity with people living with dementia in residential care. The research team is&#xD;
      interested in checking the efficacy of the activity. The team will also evaluate if art&#xD;
      activities on touchscreen tablets are accepted by participants and carers and if the&#xD;
      intervention is feasible in care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following research questions were formulated for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What effects do participatory digital art on touchscreen tablets have on people with dementia&#xD;
      in care homes? (impact on participants - efficacy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      How the insertion of the digital art activity is perceived by people with dementia and the&#xD;
      care staff (acceptability of the intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
      How can digital art apps be implemented in care homes to be delivered by the staff?&#xD;
      (practicality of the intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCESS AND TIMETABLE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Week 1 to Week 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These weeks will focus on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits to explain the study to participants and consultees (30 minutes). Collection of the&#xD;
      consent of the participants and consultees and answer questions (20 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the informed consent is signed potential participants with dementia will be accessed for&#xD;
      cognition with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment - MoCA to ensure that the potential&#xD;
      participants fit the inclusion criteria and will give the investigators a baseline on&#xD;
      participants' cognition before the intervention (10 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participants are selected, staff members will be contacted to reply to questions and&#xD;
      questionnaires about the participant with dementia. Staff members will be asked to provide&#xD;
      demographic information about the participants (3 minutes for each participant with&#xD;
      dementia), to answer questions about the care home life (5 minutes), and to answer a&#xD;
      proxy-instrument, the QUALIDEM for each of the participants (5 minutes for each participant&#xD;
      with dementia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 4 to Week 7:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention activities with the participants with dementia will take place during these&#xD;
      four weeks. The intervention will be delivered to the participants with dementia at a quiet&#xD;
      room in the care home by two co-investigators, one will be the facilitator, and the other one&#xD;
      will be the observer. All the sessions will be video recorded and analysed by two independent&#xD;
      co-investigators. The use of video was preferred to observation and note taken as with it is&#xD;
      possible to analyse the interaction between the participant and facilitator with the&#xD;
      touchscreen tablet at the same time. With the analysis of the intervention through videos is&#xD;
      also possible to focus on details that could be missed with observations, as videos give the&#xD;
      opportunity to pause and repeat key points of the interaction for a comprehensive analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is a 30-minutes of individual sessions, with 10 minutes of app use. The&#xD;
      additional 20 minutes will include the setup of the equipment and preparation of the&#xD;
      participant at the beginning of the session; and questions for the participants at the end.&#xD;
      The sessions will happen in the afternoon four days a week (on weekdays), with 6 participants&#xD;
      per day (one of the groups). Each group will have fixed session days, to make the staff aware&#xD;
      of which participants would have a session on a specific day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection here will be made through:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' observation: Participants' behaviour in the video records of the sessions will&#xD;
      be analysed with an adapted version of the Greater Cincinnati Chapter Wellbeing Observation&#xD;
      Tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions to participants: At the end of each session, the participants will be asked to&#xD;
      answer questions on visual analogue scales (VAS) to evaluate participants subjective&#xD;
      wellbeing at that moment (3 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires and questions to staff: Staff members will be asked to answer the QUALIDEM&#xD;
      once a week during the 4-week intervention for each of the participants (5 minutes for each&#xD;
      participant with dementia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will also evaluate the acceptability and practicality of the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability: Participants will be asked at the end of the sessions (once a week) questions&#xD;
      about satisfaction with the apps and the intervention (3 minutes) relevance of the activity,&#xD;
      and if would be interest in continue the use of the apps (VAS, and open questions). The&#xD;
      research team will also check for actual use of the touchscreen tablet between the sessions&#xD;
      and will provide a form to the care staff keep a record (1 minute for each entry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practicality: To evaluate the practicality of the intervention, the participants and the&#xD;
      staff will be asked on the opinion on frequency and duration of the intervention (ideal and&#xD;
      what was received) (3 minutes). During the intervention the researchers will make&#xD;
      observations on care home daily life and will collect information on the type and amount of&#xD;
      resources needed, training required and time to support the intervention. There also will be&#xD;
      an analysis of the barriers and facilitators for the implementation of the activity in care&#xD;
      homes. One of the researchers will collect this information through field notes of&#xD;
      observation of the sessions and discussions with the care staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 8:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For end measurements, the MoCA (10 minutes) will be used with participants with dementia and&#xD;
      the staff members will be asked to answer the QUALIDEM for each of the participants (5&#xD;
      minutes for each participant with dementia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • At a later point (data collection finished): Once data collection is complete, the research&#xD;
      team will develop the guidance on the use of touchscreen tablets in residential care for&#xD;
      people with dementia. Staff members from the care home will be asked to give feedback on the&#xD;
      guidance through informal consultation. This informal consultation could happen through email&#xD;
      communication or in-person meetings. This should happen within 2 months after the end of data&#xD;
      collection. The analysis and writing up findings should take up to 5 months.&#xD;
