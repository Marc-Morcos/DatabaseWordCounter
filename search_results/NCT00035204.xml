  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative effects of galantamine compared to&#xD;
      donepezil (both cholinesteraste inhibitors), on sleep, attention, and gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tolerance in patients with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

      This is designed as a pilot (preliminary) study to evaluate the differences in effects on&#xD;
      attention, sleep problems and gastrointestinal tolerance associated with Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      with two different drugs at two different doses. Patients must have mild to moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative&#xD;
      Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA)&#xD;
      criteria and a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 10 to 24. The trial will consist&#xD;
      of a 2-week run-in phase, an 8-week assessment phase, and an extension phase of variable&#xD;
      length (6 weeks to 54 weeks). During the study, patients will be randomized (assigned by&#xD;
      chance) to receive either galantamine or donepezil. Galantamine will be given by mouth 4mg&#xD;
      twice daily for Weeks 1-4 and then 8mg twice daily for Weeks 5-8 and beyond (for participants&#xD;
      in the extension). The patients on donezepil will receive 5mg by mouth at bedtime for Weeks&#xD;
      1-4 and then 10mg at bedtime for Weeks 5-8 and beyond. Placebo tablets will be given so that&#xD;
      each patient takes two capsules per dose in order to conceal the identity of the drugs.&#xD;
      Neither the patient nor the physician will know which drug the patient is receiving. Drug&#xD;
      effectiveness will be measured by change in overall functioning of the patient shown by the&#xD;
      Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Family Input (CIBIC-Plus). Other tests&#xD;
      to evaluate whether the drug is effective will include the change in results of attention&#xD;
      tests (Simple Reaction Time [SRT], Choice Reaction Time [CRT], Verbal Series Attention Test&#xD;
      [VSAT], and Stroop Test), and in sleep pattern tests (tests that measure movements during&#xD;
      sleep [Actiwatch] and patterns of sleep such as the caregiver-completed Pittsburgh Sleep&#xD;
      Quality Index [PSQI] and the Circadian Sleep Inventory for Normal and Pathological States&#xD;
      [CSINAPS]). Measures of quality of life will include the Alzheimer's Disease Related Quality&#xD;
      of Life Scale (ADRQL) and the caregiver-completed Allocation of Caregiver Time Survey (ACTS)&#xD;
      and SF-12 Quality of Life Survey. Safety assessment and gastrointestinal tolerability will be&#xD;
      based on recording the number and severity of unexpected and undesirable events as well as&#xD;
      physical examination and vital signs. The exploratory study hypotheses are that galantamine&#xD;
      will be superior to donezepil in improving attention, sleep patterns, and quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease and that it will be well tolerated by&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive either galantamine 4mg twice daily by mouth or donepezil 5mg at bedtime&#xD;
      . Then, either galantamine 8mg twice daily by mouth or donezepil 10 mg at bedtime by mouth&#xD;
      (with placebo dose); the doses are continued into the double-blind extension phase (6 to 54&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or post-menopausal female out-patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have mild to moderate dementia as evidenced by a Mini-Mental State&#xD;
             Examination score of 10-24 inclusive at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must show a history of cognitive decline that has been gradual in onset&#xD;
             and progressive over a period of at least six months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There must be evidence of sustained memory deterioration in an otherwise alert&#xD;
             patient, plus additional impairment in at least one of the following five areas:&#xD;
             orientation, judgement and problem solving, functioning in community affairs,&#xD;
             functioning in home and hobbies, or functioning in personal care&#xD;
