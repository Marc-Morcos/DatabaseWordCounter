  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MK-4334&#xD;
      administered once daily (QD) in participants with Alzheimer's clinical syndrome receiving a&#xD;
      stable, daily dose of donepezil 10 mg, taken orally (PO). This includes participants with&#xD;
      symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that the true geometric mean minimum plasma concentration at 24 hours (C24)&#xD;
      is at least 60 nM at steady state in the presence of steady-state donepezil 10 mg.&#xD;
