      The study aims to identify immune biomarkers in peripheral blood for identifying Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD). Blood samples from subjects with AD will be compared to age-matched controls&#xD;
      without cognitive symptoms, as well as healthy younger subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss&#xD;
      of cognitive brain functions and functional decline. One of the pathological features of this&#xD;
      condition is the progressive deposition in the brain of amyloid beta-peptide (A-beta) (1).&#xD;
      Once deposited in the brain, the peptide exerts a toxic effect by triggering a chronic&#xD;
      inflammation that interferes initially with normal brain function and results eventually in&#xD;
      neuronal death (2). It is currently postulated that at a certain threshold of A-beta&#xD;
      accumulation compensatory mechanisms in the brain are no longer sufficient to cope with&#xD;
      A-beta toxicity, and the clinical syndrome of AD develops. It is possible that A-beta may&#xD;
      accumulate in the brain over a period of up to 10-15 years before clinical symptoms become&#xD;
      significant. The question has been raised whether the accumulation of A-beta is possibly a&#xD;
      normal process of aging, suggesting that all people may be susceptible to the disease if they&#xD;
      live long enough - of note is that the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease rises to over 40%&#xD;
      above the age of 85 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the many possible ageing-related factors involved in the development of AD, senescence&#xD;
      of the immune system may significantly enhance changes in the brain and intensify the&#xD;
      neurological decline in patients with this disease. A direct consequence of immunosenescence&#xD;
      is the increased frequency of systemic infections and, in fact, many who die with AD have&#xD;
      previously suffered from a severe infection. Since patients with AD have an ongoing chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory response in the brain, associated with the activation of glial cells and a&#xD;
      partially disrupted blood brain barrier, systemic inflammation may intensify this process in&#xD;
      the brain and increase the overall neuronal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to the damage caused by immune activation, A-beta vaccination studies have shown&#xD;
      very promising effects in mouse models of the disease, particularly with regard to the&#xD;
      clearance of amyloid plaques by A-beta antibodies (3). When tested in patients with AD, 6% of&#xD;
      the vaccinated patients developed severe inflammatory reactions in the brain (4).&#xD;
      Nonetheless, a cohort of patients showed improved cognitive tests where specific antibodies&#xD;
      were induced (5). In a recent study we demonstrated that such brain inflammation may be due&#xD;
      to increased levels of IFN-γ in the brain (6), possibly as a result of sub-clinical systemic&#xD;
      infection and the specific immune responses observed in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the chronic inflammation progresses throughout the disease, the specific arm of the&#xD;
      immune system, i.e., brain-specific lymphocytes, may also be stimulated to play a role. In&#xD;
      contrast to previous assumptions, our findings in human subjects with AD demonstrate that a&#xD;
      specific immune response to A-beta is indeed significantly induced in both elderly&#xD;
      individuals and patients with AD as compared to middle-aged individuals (7). The nature and&#xD;
      role of this immune response to A-beta in man is yet to be investigated, and may lead to the&#xD;
      characterization of pathways associated with neuronal cell death, and result in new&#xD;
      diagnostic modalities and immunotherapeutic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether peripheral markers possibly related to&#xD;
      A-beta induced inflammation of the brain are increased in patients with clinical AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method This is an observational pilot study comparing the level of inflammatory markers in&#xD;
      the peripheral blood of patients with AD to that of age-matched and cognitively normal&#xD;
      elderly individuals, as well as to healthy young controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will include males and females older than 60 years diagnosed as having clinical AD&#xD;
      according to DSM-IV criteria. The control group will comprise cognitively normal community&#xD;
      dwelling males and females older than 60 years. In addition, a group of healthy young male&#xD;
      and female controls aged 20-30 years will serve as the reference group. The diagnosis of both&#xD;
      older patients and controls will be determined independently by a multidisciplinary team of&#xD;
      experts at the Memory Clinic of the Beersheva Mental Health Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects and controls will be required to provide written informed consent for&#xD;
      participation in the study. In the case of the patients with AD an independent psychiatrist&#xD;
      will be required to confirm that the patient is capable of agreeing to participation in the&#xD;
      study. In the case of patients with AD who have impaired judgment and are unable to consent&#xD;
      to their participation, a legal guardian will be required to provide written informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the acquisition of demographic data, a single amount of 25 ml of blood will be&#xD;
      drawn from all subjects. Blood will be drawn into two heparinized tubes of 10 ml each and one&#xD;
      serological tube (with procoagulant) of five ml will be drawn for serum isolation. The&#xD;
      heparinized tubes will be maintained at room temperature until lymphocytes are purified on&#xD;
      the same day. Sera samples will be stored at 4°C. Blood will be drawn before midday to&#xD;
      facilitate purification on the same day. Following peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)&#xD;
      and sera isolation the following analysis will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Generation of AD-specific monoclonal antibodies. Since antibodies which bind the&#xD;
           N-terminus portion of A-beta enhance its clearance from the brain and are now tested in&#xD;
           a clinical trial, it is important to identify the naturally occurring specific&#xD;
           monoclonal antibodies induced in patients with AD and determine whether they affect the&#xD;
           course of the disease. Such specific antibodies also may have diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
           properties. These specific human monoclonal antibodies will be isolated and produced in&#xD;
           vitro by the hybridoma technique using a proprietary fusion partner cell line known as&#xD;
           MFP-2. Briefly, PBMCs will be fused with MFP-2 and the resulting hybridomas will be&#xD;
           screened for nonspecific Ig production and then for those immunoglobulins that are&#xD;
           specific to A-beta using standard techniques of ELISA. Hybridomas that secrete specific&#xD;
           human monoclonal antibodies will be serially subcloned for stabilization, expanded and&#xD;
           grown in defined media for production of large quantities of monoclonal antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis of T-cell subsets and serum-derived cytokines. Aging is associated with&#xD;
           senecense of the immune system expressed by a decline in naïve T cells and an increase&#xD;
           in memory and regulatory T cells. As a result cytokine homeostasis both in the periphery&#xD;
           and in the brain is altered and may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, analysis&#xD;
           of T-cell subsets (naïve and memory CD4, CD8, and regulatory CD4CD25) using&#xD;
           Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and serum-derived cytokines by ELISA will be&#xD;
           performed and correlated with the clinical score of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical evaluation of differences in mean values between groups will be performed using&#xD;
      the Student's-t test.&#xD;
