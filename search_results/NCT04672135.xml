    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 randomized double blind, first in human (FIH) study with the novel oral&#xD;
      Alzheimer drug candidate REM0046127, which consists of two main parts, a single ascending&#xD;
      dose (SAD) study with 7 cohorts followed by a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study with 2&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;

      SAD&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a baseline, 5 cohorts of 8 young healthy males are foreseen, with a repeat to assess food&#xD;
      impact and an additional elderly cohort. Depending on the early FIH findings, the number of&#xD;
      cohorts could be more or less. FIH studies include initially only males due to the incomplete&#xD;
      nature of preclinical reproductive toxicology studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment duration: single day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2 volunteers on placebos, of which 1 sentinel&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  6 volunteers on study drug, of which 1 sentinel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timing for each cohort will be about 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects will be screened for selection from day -21 to day -1 before starting the&#xD;
                experimental phase of each cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  First the 2 sentinels will be dosed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Following the review of sentinel safety and tolerability data through the Data&#xD;
                Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) after one day or 2 half-life times following the&#xD;
                sentinel dosing, the remaining 1+5 subjects will be randomized and dosed&#xD;
                approximately 7 days after the sentinels&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First cohort of 10 healthy young male subjects. This cohort can be initiated after the&#xD;
           food interaction has been assessed in the last safe SAD cohort, and does not need to&#xD;
           wait for the elderly cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second cohort of 12 healthy elderly subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The 1st cohort of healthy young male at about 75% of the Maximum Tolerated Dose&#xD;
                (MTD) of the SAD&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The 2nd cohort of healthy older male and female (not of child-bearing potential) at&#xD;
                about 50 or 100% of the highest tolerable dose of the SAD, depending on the&#xD;
                observations in the 1st MAD cohort to assess potential impact of age on&#xD;
                Pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment duration: 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Timing for each cohort will be about 35 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be screened for selection from day -21 to day -1 before starting the&#xD;
           experimental phase each cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First the sentinels will be dosed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the review of sentinel safety and tolerability data through the DSMB, the&#xD;
           remaining subjects will be randomized and dosed approximately 14 days later&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  According to plan the sentinels of the 2nd cohort will be dosed about 35 days after the&#xD;
           sentinels of the 1st cohort.&#xD;
