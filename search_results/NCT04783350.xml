      The proposed project aims to systematically examine the feasibility of remote, caregiver-led&#xD;
      tACS for older adults who are vulnerable to memory decline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a feasibility study, which will include older adult participants (Ps) with memory&#xD;
      deficits together with willing and able administrators (As) to administer tACS to the&#xD;
      participants. This study will include 20 older Ps and 20 As to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      deploying home-based tACS in larger clinical trials, and to prepare for the development and&#xD;
      implementation of such trials. The proposed project will systematically examine the&#xD;
      feasibility of remote, caregiver-led tACS for older adults who are vulnerable to memory&#xD;
      decline. This study will provide data to support the safety and effectiveness of home-based&#xD;
      tACS in this population and will lead to future research to increase access of tACS as a part&#xD;
      of memory decline prevention and treatment for older adults who have more difficulty reaching&#xD;
      a clinic for treatment due to disability or who live more remotely.&#xD;
