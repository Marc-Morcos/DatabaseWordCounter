  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to validate that a previously identified gene variant influences&#xD;
      the proportion of activated microglia (PAM) and the amount of TSPO binding on PET imaging, to&#xD;
      identify novel loci that influence PAM and TSPO PET, and to understand the functional&#xD;
      consequences of gene variants that drive microglial activation in Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While activated microglia have been observed in the vicinity of neuritic amyloid plaques in&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), there have been no large-scale assessments of microglial activation&#xD;
      in aging and neurodegenerative disease. The investigators seek to understand the genetic&#xD;
      underpinning of microglial responses-particularly the proportion of microglia in a&#xD;
      morphologically-defined state of activation-that increase susceptibility to AD, so the&#xD;
      investigators can develop more targeted forms of immune-based therapies to prevent cognitive&#xD;
      decline and progression to dementia. The objective is to refine the genetic architecture of&#xD;
      microglial activation to validate a previously identified gene variant -- and to identify&#xD;
      novel loci -- that influence the proportion of activated microglia. The investigators also&#xD;
      seek to understand the functional consequences of variants driving microglial activation in&#xD;
      AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that identifiable gene variants influence microglial activation and&#xD;
      susceptibility to AD. The investigators will test this hypothesis by conducting genome-wide&#xD;
      analysis and identifying associations between gene variants and microglial activation.&#xD;
      Microglial activation will be measured in human autopsy tissue (ex vivo), living human brain&#xD;
      using PET imaging (in vivo), and in monocyte-derived microglia-like cells (in situ and in&#xD;
      vitro).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This genetic study is designed to validate a finding that was discovered in participants with&#xD;
      self-reported European-Caucasian ancestry. Therefore, the study seeks to enroll participants&#xD;
      who self-report as white, not Hispanic or Latino. However, if this study is successful, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to use the methods in this protocol in a future study to identify new&#xD;
      genetic variants associated with changes on TSPO PET in a more diverse participant&#xD;
      population. The investigators intend to use the results from this study to eventually benefit&#xD;
      individuals of all racial and ethnic groups.&#xD;

    <measure>Correlation between the chromosome 1 variant (rs2997325) and TSPO binding</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The measure will be in vivo validation of GWAS and assessment of clinical relevance by performing TSPO PET imaging using 11C-ER176 to measure microglial activation. PET images will be analyzed using 1) the two-tissue kinetic model to calculate total distribution volume, corrected for free fraction of radioligand in plasma (VT/fP). Analysis will be a meta-analysis of the association of rs2997325 with 11C-ER176 binding (total distribution volume, VT).</description>

    <description>11C-ER176 data will be used to perform a discovery GWAS for additional variants that influence TSPO binding and to define the genetic architecture of the PAM trait. Using PLINK and all imputed high quality genotypes (imputation r2 &gt;0.8), adjusted for sex, age, and technical variables, the investigators will perform a GWAS for TSPO binding.</description>

    <description>Subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will have one PET scan with 11C-ER176, with arterial sampling. If the subject lacks known AD-biomarkers, they may undergo a 18F-florbetaben PET scan prior to the 11C-ER176 PET scan. Genome-wide genetic analysis will be performed. Participants will undergo an annual clinical evaluation and blood sample collection for 5 years to establish the trajectory of AD-related serum biomarkers and syndromic diagnoses.</description>

    <description>11C-ER176 is a novel TSPO radioligand that was developed because of its relative insensitivity to the rs6971 polymorphism. Increased TSPO signal on PET is associated with activation of microglia in the brain. The radioligand will be administered in tracer doses at activity of up to 20 mCi (740 MBq), IV, total of one injection. A single dose of radioligand will be injected over 1 minute.</description>
