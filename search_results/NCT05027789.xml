  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine if training in memory support aids and healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle activities (physical exercise, mentally stimulating activities and stress&#xD;
      management) can have a positive effect on memory, thinking, and activities that people do&#xD;
      every day. Participation in this study will involve being placed into one of two groups: a&#xD;
      Self-Guided Intervention Group or a Structured Intervention Group. Both groups will be asked&#xD;
      to attend group sessions in which they will be provided education on memory support&#xD;
      strategies and lifestyle changes. The Structured Intervention Group will also be provided&#xD;
      with an iPad and a digital application (called EMMA) to track their activity. Study&#xD;
      participation involves a 6-month intervention and completing outcome measures at 4 different&#xD;
      time points for up to a year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this research will be asked to participate in group sessions about memory&#xD;
      support strategies and healthy behaviors. They may also choose to have a partner participate&#xD;
      in this study with them, but it is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be weekly sessions for 10 weeks, followed by sessions 1 to 2 times per month for&#xD;
      the next 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete healthy lifestyle activities on their own. Before the&#xD;
      intervention starts and at three time points after the intervention, we will collect&#xD;
      cognitive assessments and questionnaires to measure the possible impact of the treatment. The&#xD;
      post-intervention assessments will take place right after completion of the intervention, and&#xD;
      then 6 and 12 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of the study, participants will be required to get permission from their&#xD;
      primary care provider to ensure that it is safe for them to complete physical aerobic&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Self-Guided and Structured Intervention Groups will be required to participate in the&#xD;
      following study activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Training Sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to attend 15 information sessions that include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. training on ways to help support memory like remembering appointments or taking&#xD;
           medication and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. training on increasing interest in three health behaviors known to reduce risk of memory&#xD;
           declines (physical exercise, mental stimulation, stress management).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These sessions will be in a group of up to 15 people and will last about 2 hours each. For 10&#xD;
      weeks, there will be sessions every week, and then for the next 4 months there will be 1-2&#xD;
      session each month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two different versions of the intervention we are evaluating. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned into one of the two groups. Both groups provide similar information about&#xD;
      memory support strategies and lifestyle modifications to promote cognitive health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-Guided Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the self-guided group will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive education on memory support strategies and healthy lifestyles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decide how they want to implement this information into their daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive information on various commercially available digital and other tools that might&#xD;
           help them implement healthy changes in their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The chance that participants will be in this group is random, like flipping a coin. One&#xD;
           in every three participants will be enrolled in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this group will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive specific recommended behavior targets (e.g., like how much exercise they should&#xD;
           engage in each week).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive an iPad to use throughout the study and follow up period with the digital&#xD;
           application installed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be asked to use the digital application to record their activity and to get reminders to&#xD;
           complete this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two in every three participants will receive the iPad and digital application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this group will receive training on how to use the digital application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with their own iPad and/or smartphone can install the digital application on&#xD;
      their personal iPad or smartphone if they prefer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the Self-Guided and Structured groups will complete the following assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular health - This questionnaire will ask about age, sex, education, blood&#xD;
      pressure, total cholesterol level, body-mass index and complete a short test of physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholesterol Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood test at the University of California Davis Pathology laboratory will be performed for&#xD;
      any participant who has not had this test in the past year. Participants must fast overnight&#xD;
      and have nothing but water for 12 hours before the blood test. Approximately 4 milliliters&#xD;
      (or about 1 teaspoon) of blood will be drawn for this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memory and Behavior Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of memory and thinking and questionnaires about health and behaviors will be completed&#xD;
      at the beginning of the study and three additional times (every 6 months). Study partners&#xD;
      will also be asked to complete some questionnaires about the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are randomized to the Structured Intervention Group will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete these additional assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week-Long Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Structured Intervention Group participants will be asked to complete daily assessments&#xD;
           for one week at four different times during participation. This will include questions&#xD;
           about the experience with EMMA and some short memory and thinking assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Digital application (EMMA) Experiences Interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A subset of participants in the Structured Intervention Group will be asked to&#xD;
                complete an interview about their experience with using EMMA. This interview will&#xD;
                occur over the telephone or video conferencing (such as Zoom) and will be recorded&#xD;
                for scoring and quality assurances. The researchers will keep these recordings&#xD;
                until the study is complete (about 5 years). This is completely voluntary, and&#xD;
                participants can choose not to complete the interview.&#xD;
