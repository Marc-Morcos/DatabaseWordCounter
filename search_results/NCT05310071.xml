      The primary objective of this study is to verify the clinical benefit of monthly doses of&#xD;
      aducanumab in slowing cognitive and functional impairment as measured by changes in the&#xD;
      Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score as compared with placebo in&#xD;
      participants with early Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in CDR-SB Score at Week 78</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 78</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR integrates assessments from 3 domains of cognition (memory, orientation, judgment/problem-solving) and 3 domains of function (community affairs, home/hobbies, personal care). Following caregiver interview and systematic participant examination, the rater assigns a score describing the participant's current performance level in each of these domains of life functioning. The &quot;Sum of boxes&quot; scoring methodology (CDR-SB) sums the score for each of the 6 domains and provides a value ranging from 0 to 18 with higher scores indicating greater impairment. Positive change from baseline indicates greater impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) Score at Weeks 78 and 106</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 78 and 106</time_frame>
    <description>The iADRS composite captures decline in both cognition and daily function. The iADRS is a simple linear combination of Alzheimer's disease assessment scale, cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog13) and the Alzheimer's disease cooperative study scale for activities of daily living in mild cognitive impairment (ADCS-ADL-MCI). The iADRS scale ranges from 0-138, higher scores indicating better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in ADCS-ADL-MCI Score at Weeks 78 and 106</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 78 and 106</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS-ADL-MCI is a functional evaluation scale for MCI participants, based on information provided by an informant who rates 18 areas of daily living, with total score ranging from 0-53. Higher scores indicate greater independent, healthy functioning. Positive change from baseline indicates healthy functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in ADAS-Cog13 Score at Weeks 78 and 106</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 78 and 106</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS-ADAS-Cog13 is a brief objective cognitive assessment of the severity of cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. The ADAS-Cog13 score ranges from 0 to 85, with higher scores indicating worse performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score at Weeks 78 and 106</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 78 and 106</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a brief cognitive screening tool that provides clinicians the ability to rapidly assess cognitive ability in less than 10 minutes. The MMSE score ranges from 0-30, with higher scores indicating better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory-10 (NPI-10) Score at Weeks 78 and 106</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 78 and 106</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI-10 is a questionnaire administered to the informant, designed to obtain information on the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms and behaviors in a participant with Alzheimer's disease. Ten areas are assessed: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability and aberrant motor behavior. The NPI total score ranges from 0 to 120. Higher scores indicates greater impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Signal at Weeks 78 and 104</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 78 and 104</time_frame>
    <description>The cerebral amyloid plaque level was measured by amyloid PET imaging.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tau PET Signal at Weeks 78 and 104</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 78 and 104</time_frame>
    <description>The cerebral tau level was measured by tau PET imaging.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in CDR-SB Score at Week 106</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 106</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR integrates assessments from 3 domains of cognition (memory, orientation, judgment/problem-solving) and 3 domains of function (community affairs, home/hobbies, personal care). Following caregiver interview and systematic participant examination, the rater assigns a score describing the participant's current performance level in each of these domains of life functioning. The &quot;Sum of boxes&quot; scoring methodology (CDR-SB) sums the score for each of the 6 domains and provides a value ranging from 0 to 18 with higher scores indicating greater impairment. Positive change from baseline indicates greater impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Global Statistical Test (GST) Composite Z-Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 78 and 106</time_frame>
    <description>The GST is a composite z-score defined as the average of standardized z-scores of the CDR-SB, ADASCog13, and ADCS-ADL-MCI. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
