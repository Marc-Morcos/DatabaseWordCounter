  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a multidomain intervention for older&#xD;
      people with dementia in nursing homes. Participants will be randomized into two equal groups,&#xD;
      to receive either an intensive multidomain intervention (intervention group) or regular&#xD;
      health advice (control group). The intervention will include physical, cognitive, and social&#xD;
      interventions and management of metabolic and vascular risk factors. We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      multidomain intervention will be feasible in Vietnam, and participants who receive the&#xD;
      intervention will show improvement in cognitive function, quality of life, behaviors,&#xD;
      functional ability, sleep, and in reduction of falls, use of healthcare services, and death&#xD;
      rate compared to those in the control group during the 6 months intervention period and after&#xD;
      the 6 months extended follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-armed, 12 month, multicenter, randomized controlled pilot study, based in 3&#xD;
      nursing homes in Hanoi, Vietnam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study PI and/or researchers in the research team will contact adults aged 60 years and&#xD;
      older in the nursing homes to introduce the study. If they are interested in participating,&#xD;
      the study PI and/or researchers in the research team will screen them for their eligibility.&#xD;
      If they meet the inclusion criteria and are interested in participating, written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who agreed to participate in the study will be randomized into two equal groups,&#xD;
      to receive either an intensive multidomain intervention (intervention group) or regular&#xD;
      health advice (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both the intervention and the control groups will be treated for dementia&#xD;
      according to the recommendations of the Vietnam Alzheimer's Disease and Neurocognitive&#xD;
      Disorders Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will meet the study physician to have an examination at baseline, 3 months,&#xD;
      and 6 months. At each examination, participants will undergo a physical examination,&#xD;
      anthropometry (weight, hip and waist circumference), blood pressure determination, pulse rate&#xD;
      and rhythm, risks of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (smoking, drinking, hypertension,&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, diabetes) and assess blood test&#xD;
      results (lipid profile, HbA1C, and fasting glucose if patients have diabetes). Results will&#xD;
      be provided to participants and their doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to what is given to both groups, participants in the intervention group will&#xD;
      receive four intervention components: (1) physical activity intervention; (2) cognitive&#xD;
      intervention; (3) social intervention; and (4) management of metabolic and vascular risk&#xD;
      factors. Physical activity and cognitive stimulation interventions will be performed at&#xD;
      separate sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcome measures will be administered at baseline, 6 months, and extended follow-up at 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
