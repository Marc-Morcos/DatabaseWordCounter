    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and safety of [18F]THK-5351&#xD;
      positron emission computed tomography. Ten cognitively healthy subjects and 10 patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease will be enrolled. The primary outcome measures are to evaluate&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of [18F]THK-5351 Positron Emission Tomography imaging . Tracer&#xD;
      biodistribution will be evaluated by global and regional standardized uptake value ratio of&#xD;
      [18F]THK-5351 in the brain. Safety. For safety assessment, a physical examination,&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram and vital signs will be performed at baseline and at the completion of all&#xD;
      imaging to assess for interval change.&#xD;
