  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a prospective international multicenter observational study, 1080 stable chest pain&#xD;
      patients (REALITY Advanced registry of CCTA patients) with the suspected chronic coronary&#xD;
      syndrome will be enrolled. All of them will undergo computed tomography angiography, CMR and/&#xD;
      or SPECT, and Echo. One of the cohorts will be examined with multimodality invasive imaging&#xD;
      including quantitative coronary angiography, FFR, QFR with or without further percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention, OCT, and some of them - with IVUS, VH-IVUS. The plaque size and&#xD;
      relevant stenosis, a composition of the atherosclerotic lesion, major adverse cardiovascular&#xD;
      events (all-cause death, death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction, or&#xD;
      rehospitalization due to unstable or progressive angina, ischemia-driven revascularization)&#xD;
      will be judged to be related to either originally treated (culprit) lesions or untreated&#xD;
      (non-culprit) lesions. Moreover, the clinical potential of both non-invasive and invasive&#xD;
      imaging, as well as anatomical vs functional modalities in two real-world patient flows, will&#xD;
      be estimated with the special focus on the natural progression of atherosclerosis, clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, and safety (contrast-induced nephropathy, radiocontrast-induced thyroid&#xD;
      dysfunction, and radiation dose). The diagnostic accuracy will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up period will achieve 12 months prospectively with collected clinical events and&#xD;
      imaging outcomes which will be determined at the baseline and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The independent ethics expertise will be provided by the Ural State Medical University&#xD;
      (Yekaterinburg, Russia) and Central Clinical Hospital of the Russian Academy of Sciences&#xD;
      (Moscow, Russia). The monitoring of the clinical data with imaging as well as further CoreLab&#xD;
      expertise (expert-level post-processing multimodal imaging software of Medis Imaging B.V.,&#xD;
      Leiden, The Netherlands) will be provided by De Haar Research Task Force,&#xD;
      Amsterdam-Rotterdam, the Netherlands. FFR-CT is scheduled to be assessed by the ElucidVivo&#xD;
      Research Edition software from Elucid Bio, Boston, MA, U.S.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The REALITY project is a part of the JHWH (Jahweh) International Advanced Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Imaging Consortium. The main objective of the Consortium that is uniting international&#xD;
      efforts of both Academia and Industry is a synergistic development of the advanced&#xD;
      machine-learning imaging software in order to integrate benefits of both non-invasive and&#xD;
      invasive imaging providing the daily clinical practice with the robust tool for the&#xD;
      anatomical and functional examination of coronary atherosclerosis, PCI-related arterial&#xD;
      remodeling, and relevant myocardial function.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive coronary angiography with fractional flow reserve (FFR) is considered as the&#xD;
      reference standard of daily clinical practice. This invasive approach is associated with&#xD;
      potentially life-threatening complications, high expenditures, relatively high radiation&#xD;
      exposure, and some patient discomfort. Noninvasive cardiac computed tomography angiography&#xD;
      (CCTA) becomes a robust alternative to the invasive approach, especially when supported by&#xD;
      other functional and anatomical noninvasive imaging modalities such as cardiac magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (CMR), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and echocardiography&#xD;
      (Echo). Notwithstanding, their invasive counterpart, particularly a multimodal intravascular&#xD;
      imaging (including fractional flow reserve/ FFR, quantitative flow reserve/ QFR, optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography/ OCT, intravascular ultrasound/ IVUS, VH-IVUS) is able to rule out the&#xD;
      high-risk, vulnerable and obstructive atherosclerosis dramatically optimizing clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. The clinical value of these techniques remains questionable, especially if compared&#xD;
      between noninvasive and invasive imaging methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modern-day imaging modalities allow clinical cardiology to study the natural history of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis that can predict certain clinical outcomes paving the way for a reduction of&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality. The retrospective studies have shown that most atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaques responsible for future acute coronary syndromes are angiographically mild, and the&#xD;
      lesion-related risk factors for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are poorly&#xD;
      understood. Pathological studies have shown that thrombotic coronary occlusion after rupture&#xD;
      of a lipid-rich atheroma with only a thin fibrous layer of intimal tissue covering the&#xD;
      necrotic core (a thin-cap fibroatheroma) is the most common cause of myocardial infarction&#xD;
      and death from cardiac causes. However, the prospective identification of thin-cap&#xD;
      fibroatheromas has not been achieved, in part because the imaging tools to identify them in&#xD;
      vivo did not exist until recently (Stone GW, et al, 2011; DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1002358). Both&#xD;
      CCTA and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) provide us with the potential of the&#xD;
      advanced imaging of atherosclerotic lesions, but accuracy and safety remain the keystone&#xD;
      limitations of these approaches. CCTA has the unique advantage over detecting non-calcifying&#xD;
      plaques in addition to calcifying lesions, thus allowing for direct visualization of early&#xD;
      atherosclerosis stages such as lipid and fibrous atheroma, which are risk factors for future&#xD;
      coronary events. Long-term studies report an increased risk of the adverse outcomes&#xD;
      associated with vulnerable fibroatheroma, whereas calcifying lesions tend to remain rather&#xD;
      stable. Studies investigating the accuracy, outcome, and, thus, the diagnostic benefit of&#xD;
      coronary CCTA in chest pain patients are scarce (Plank F, et al, 2014;&#xD;
      doi:10.1136/openhrt-2014-000096). The accuracy of some advanced imaging modalities has&#xD;
      recently developed to overcome existing limitations, however, the accuracy and precision of&#xD;
      those measurements in the different stage lesions have not been established (Kan J, et al,&#xD;
      2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective international multicenter observational study, 1080 stable chest pain&#xD;
      patients (REALITY Advanced registry of CCTA patients) with the suspected chronic coronary&#xD;
      syndrome will be enrolled. All of them will undergo computed tomography angiography, CMR,&#xD;
      and/ or SPECT, and Echo. One of the cohorts will be examined with multimodality invasive&#xD;
      imaging including quantitative coronary angiography with or without further percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention, FFR, QFR, OCT, and some of them - with IVUS, VH-IVUS. The plaque size&#xD;
      and relevant stenosis, a composition of the atherosclerotic lesion, major adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events (all-cause death, death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction, or&#xD;
      rehospitalization due to unstable or progressive angina, ischemia-driven revascularization)&#xD;
      will be judged to be related to either originally treated (culprit) lesions or untreated&#xD;
      (non-culprit) lesions. Moreover, the clinical potential of both non-invasive and invasive&#xD;
      imaging, as well as anatomical vs functional modalities in two real-world patient flows, will&#xD;
      be estimated with the special focus on the natural progression of atherosclerosis, clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, and safety (contrast-induced nephropathy, radiocontrast-induced thyroid&#xD;
      dysfunction, and radiation dose). The diagnostic accuracy will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up period will achieve 12 months prospectively with collected clinical events and&#xD;
      imaging outcomes which will be determined at the baseline and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The independent ethics expertise will be provided by the Ural State Medical University&#xD;
      (Yekaterinburg, Russia) and Central Clinical Hospital of the Russian Academy of Sciences&#xD;
      (Moscow, Russia). The monitoring of the clinical data with imaging as well as further CoreLab&#xD;
      expertise (expert-level post-processing multimodal imaging software of Medis Imaging B.V.,&#xD;
      Leiden, The Netherlands) will be provided by De Haar Research Task Force,&#xD;
      Amsterdam-Rotterdam, the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical data of the REALITY Advanced Registry include information of the complex&#xD;
      examination with a 64-128-slice CT, two interviews with the risk factor modification&#xD;
      recommendations, lab screening (serum fasting glucose, asparagine transaminase, alanine&#xD;
      transaminase, total bilirubin, carbamide/ urea, creatinine, total cholesterol, triglycerides,&#xD;
      LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol), markers of the myocardium damage&#xD;
      (myoglobin, troponin I, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, brain natriuretic peptide -&#xD;
      NT-proBNP), complete blood count, ECG, and Echo. The Registry patients will be tested with&#xD;
      HeartAge, SCORE, Duke ACC/ AHA, Duke - DCS, Diamond-Forrester - DFM, The Seattle Angina&#xD;
      Questionnaire - SAQ, Duke Activity Status Index -DASI, and EQ-5D-5L. Patients will be&#xD;
      screened for the major risk factors and their modification: unhealthy blood cholesterol&#xD;
      levels, high blood pressure, smoking, insulin resistance, diabetes, overweight or obesity,&#xD;
      lack of physical activity, unhealthy diet (elements of Mediterranean and so-called 'Russian'&#xD;
      diet), older age, genetic or lifestyle factors, family history of early heart disease.&#xD;
      Moreover, such factors as CRP, sleep apnea, stress, and alcohol consumption will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligibility criteria which the candidates must have fulfilled will be verified and the&#xD;
      optimal clinical strategy will be estimated by the Heart Team, the Data Safety, and&#xD;
      Monitoring Board. The clinical outcomes will be examined by the independent clinical endpoint&#xD;
      adjudication committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CCTA will be undergone in accordance with the 2016 SCCT (Society of Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Computed Tomography) guidelines for the performance and acquisition of coronary computed&#xD;
      tomographic angiography (Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography/JCCT 2016;10:435e449).&#xD;
      The results of the CCTA will be interpreted taking into account the 2020 SCCT Expert&#xD;
      Consensus Document on Coronary CT Imaging of Atherosclerotic Plaque (JCCT 2020) and the 2021&#xD;
      SCCT Expert Consensus Document on Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography (JCCT 2021). All&#xD;
      non-invasive and invasive imaging procedures will be performed in accordance with local site&#xD;
      practice, national, international, and societal guidelines including Society for&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR), American Society of Echocardiography (ASE),&#xD;
      European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EuroPCR/ EAPCI), Society&#xD;
      for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging data from non-invasive (CCTA, FFR-CT, CMR, SPECT, Echo) and invasive (QCA, FFR,&#xD;
      QFR, OCT, IVUS, VH-IVUS) methods will be handled and analyzed with the expert-level&#xD;
      post-processing imaging software (Medis Suite Solutions: MR, XA, QFR, CT, Intravascular,&#xD;
      Ultrasound) from Medis Medical Imaging Systems B.V. (Leiden, The Netherlands), if applicable.&#xD;
      Raw imaging data will be transferred to the independent CoreLab (De Haar Research Task Force,&#xD;
      Rotterdam-Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and analyzed by two experienced readers, blinded to the&#xD;
      patient's information. The interobserver disagreements will be resolved by a third reader.&#xD;
      FFR-CT is scheduled to be assessed by the ElucidVivo Research Edition software from Elucid&#xD;
      Bio, Boston, MA, U.S.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The REALITY project is a part of the JHWH (Jahweh) International Advanced Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Imaging Consortium. The main objective of the Consortium that is uniting international&#xD;
      efforts of both Academia and Industry is a synergistic development of the advanced&#xD;
      machine-learning imaging software in order to integrate benefits of both non-invasive and&#xD;
      invasive imaging providing the daily clinical practice with the robust tool for the&#xD;
      anatomical and functional examination of coronary atherosclerosis, PCI-related arterial&#xD;
      remodeling, and relevant myocardial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the REALITY Advanced trial is to evaluate the natural history of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis within the concept of the Glagovian arterial remodeling in stable chest pain&#xD;
      patients with the assessment of the clinical potential/ prognostic value and safety of the&#xD;
      different noninvasive and invasive imaging tools as CCTA (and/ or CMR, SPECT, Echo), QCA,&#xD;
      FFR, QFR, and applicable intravascular imaging (OCT, IVUS, VH-IVUS) handled with the advanced&#xD;
      post-processing imaging software. Some preventive and therapeutic strategies will be&#xD;
      examined, focusing on the place in routine clinical practice of such noninvasive imaging&#xD;
      approach as CCTA vs relevant invasive imaging. The currently developed noninvasive imaging&#xD;
      tools, including 64-128-320-slice CCTA processed with the high-accuracy machine-learning&#xD;
      imaging software, can upgrade the noninvasive imaging's clinical value in contrary to the&#xD;
      invasive approach, evaluating the significance of coronary atherosclerosis with related&#xD;
      high-risk features of the arterial remodeling, predicting clinical outcomes, and avoiding&#xD;
      unnecessary invasive intravascular interventions. The optimization of the diagnostic strategy&#xD;
      and associated interventional approach can pave the way for dramatic improvement of clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and cost-effectiveness of coronary artery disease (CAD) clinical management and,&#xD;
      therefore, for substantial cardiovascular mortality reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The REALITY Advanced trial pursued several objectives as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare anatomical methods of noninvasive (CCTA, CMR) vs. invasive (QCA, OCT, IVUS,&#xD;
           VH-IVUS) imaging with a focus on the options such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. High-risk and vulnerable features of lesions, including plaque composition with&#xD;
                particular attention to the size of the necrotic core, the thickness and&#xD;
                histological condition of the cap, signs of erosion, rupture, local thrombosis,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Arterial remodeling,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Significance of a 40% plaque burden as a keystone threshold for progression of&#xD;
                atherosclerosis and clinical outcomes,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Perivascular inflammation,&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Culprit vs. non-culprit lesions,&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Assessment of the blood flow physiological patterns, including invasively measured&#xD;
                vs. calculated fractional flow reserve, wall shear stress (if applicable) derived&#xD;
                from both noninvasive and invasive imaging and handled by the advanced&#xD;
                post-processing imaging software,&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Diagnostic accuracy in comparison between various imaging modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To match noninvasive and invasive anatomical (CCTA, QCA, OCT, IVUS, VH-IVUS) vs.&#xD;
           functional (Echo, CMR, SPECT, MSCT) imaging, particularly if the anatomical significance&#xD;
           of coronary atherosclerosis compared to the time trajectory of the cardiac function with&#xD;
           a focus on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Ischemia (assessed by stress testing with CMR, SPECT, MSCT, Echo),&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Strain (both regional and global with different imaging modalities),&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Inflammation, including edema, fibrosis, particularly with CMR (hyperemia with EGE/&#xD;
                early gadolinium enhancement, edema with T2 weighted imaging, and scar/necrosis or&#xD;
                fibrosis with LGE/ late gadolinium enhancement),&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Local coronary hemodynamics,&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Diagnostic accuracy in comparison between various imaging modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To calculate the predictive value (with some risk stratification models) of different&#xD;
           noninvasive and invasive imaging modalities amid various therapeutic strategies and&#xD;
           invasive interventions. The performance of each strategy will be examined for&#xD;
           sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value&#xD;
           (NPV), and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To conduct epidemiological analysis of the involved population and evaluate the&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness of the different noninvasive and invasive strategies in stable chest&#xD;
           pain patients, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Direct effects: cost of imaging test, cost of complications due to imaging testing,&#xD;
                effects of radiation, effects of contrast material, other complications of&#xD;
                noninvasive and invasive imaging, psychological effects of the imaging test,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Indirect effects: cost of the treatment, cost of complications of treatment, cost&#xD;
                of health outcome, medical pathway, and health outcome depending on a medical&#xD;
                decision based on the image test result, psychological effects of the test result.&#xD;
