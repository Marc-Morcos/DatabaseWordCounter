      The purpose of the TRC-PAD study is to develop a large, well-characterized,&#xD;
      biomarker-confirmed, trial-ready cohort to facilitate rapid enrollment into AD prevention&#xD;
      trials utilizing the APT Webstudy and subsequent referral to in-clinic evaluation and&#xD;
      biomarker confirmation. Participants with known biomarker status may have direct referral to&#xD;
      the Trial-Ready Cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are interested in being selected for the TRC-PAD study, you should first enroll in the&#xD;
      APT Webstudy (https://www.aptwebstudy.org/welcome).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TRC-PAD study is short for the &quot;Trial-Ready Cohort for the Prevention of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Dementia&quot;. The purpose of the TRC-PAD study is to find many people (also called a &quot;cohort&quot;)&#xD;
      who are interested in participating in clinical trials aimed at discovering treatments that&#xD;
      will reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia. TRC-PAD will help researchers enroll&#xD;
      participants into these trials quickly to allow new treatments to be discovered as soon as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TRC-PAD study is for individuals, age 50 and older, who may be at increased risk for&#xD;
      memory loss caused by Alzheimer's disease. To join the TRC-PAD study, you first need to be&#xD;
      invited to complete an in-person TRC-PAD visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How can I be invited to an in-person visit for TRC-PAD? Members of the Alzheimer Prevention&#xD;
      Trials (APT) Webstudy complete online questionnaires and memory tests. The results of these&#xD;
      tests will identify individuals as being eligible for an in-person TRC-PAD visit. If you are&#xD;
      not enrolled in the APT Webstudy, you may be invited to an in-person visit for TRC-PAD&#xD;
      because other tests or procedures you have had suggest you might be eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How might the TRC-PAD Study help researchers learn more about Alzheimer's disease dementia?&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease remains one of the most important medical conditions for which there is&#xD;
      no treatment. Among the top ten causes of death, Alzheimer's disease is the only one that&#xD;
      cannot be prevented, cured, or even slowed. To change this, researchers are conducting&#xD;
      clinical trials to find new treatments. These trials need to study large numbers of&#xD;
      individuals and follow participants over long periods of time. The goal of TRC-PAD is to&#xD;
      identify individuals for these trials. TRC-PAD will find a group of people who may be&#xD;
      &quot;at-risk&quot; for developing Alzheimer's dementia in the future and are appropriate for&#xD;
      prevention trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How does TRC-PAD decide that I may have an increased risk for developing Alzheimer's&#xD;
      dementia? A person's risk for developing Alzheimer's dementia is determined by a number of&#xD;
      factors including family history, performance on memory tests, and biological tests called&#xD;
      biomarkers. Biomarkers are measurements in parts of the body - like blood tests or brain&#xD;
      scans - to help assess the presence of, or potential to develop, a disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If I decide to join TRC-PAD, what happens? Individuals in the TRC-PAD study will complete&#xD;
      several assessments to see if they qualify to join the cohort. This will include biomarker&#xD;
      testing (via Positron Emission Tomography (PET) brain scan or spinal fluid collection), tests&#xD;
      of memory and thinking, questionnaires about daily functioning, mood and behavior, genetic&#xD;
      testing and routine blood and urine tests. Individuals who are determined to eligible to&#xD;
      enroll in TRC will come back to the clinic every 6 months for brief longitudinal follow-up&#xD;
      visits with questionnaires and testing until that individual qualifies for a clinical trial.&#xD;

Once optimized, this algorithm will be able to select amyloid positive individuals (and eventually tau and other neurodegenerative biomarkers) with &gt;75% accuracy, greatly reducing future costly biomarker screen fails.</description>
