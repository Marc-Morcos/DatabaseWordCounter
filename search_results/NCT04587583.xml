    <textblock>
      This research will test the WeCareAdvisor tool for family caregivers of military veterans&#xD;
      with dementia to help caregivers assess, manage and track behavioral symptoms and their&#xD;
      contributing factors (e.g., pain, sleep disturbance), and that provides tailored strategies&#xD;
      for in-home, medication-free behavior management. 60 caregiver-person with dementia dyads&#xD;
      will be recruited (30 Treatment Group, 30 Wait-List Control Group).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by a study specific questionnaire completed by caregivers. Stress is measured on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is equivalent to no stress and 5 is equivalent to extreme stress.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Confidence in Managing Problematic Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by a study specific questionnaire completed by caregivers. Confidence in managing problematic behavior is measured on a scale of 0 to 10, where a score of 0 means not confident and 10 means extremely confident</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Upset</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by a study specific questionnaire completed by caregivers. Upset is measured on a scale of 0 to 5 where 0 is equivalent to no upset and 5 is equivalent to extreme upset (midpoint is equivalent to fairly upset).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Communication</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers rate the frequency of using six forms of negative communication (yelling, threatening, criticizing, withdrawing from patient, using harsh tone and screaming), measured on a scale of 1 to 5 where a score of 1 is never and a score of 5 is always.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Ease of Use of the WeCareAdvisor Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after using WeCareAdvisor tool</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by a study specific questionnaire completed by caregivers. Ease of use of the WeCareAdvisor tool is measured on a scale of 1 to 7 where 1 is equivalent to strongly disagree and 7 is equivalent to strongly agree (midpoint is equivalent to neutral).</description>
