  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a blood pressure medication,&#xD;
      spironolactone, can be tolerated by older African American adults that have memory and&#xD;
      thinking problems, also called mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study will also&#xD;
      investigate the effect of spironolactone on memory and thinking abilities as measured by&#xD;
      performance on cognitive tests, which are tests that measure memory and thinking skills.&#xD;
      Participants will take spironolactone or a placebo for one year and will have 4 to 5 study&#xD;
      visits during the study period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2018, 5.5 million older adults in the United States were diagnosed with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, and it is predicted that 15 million people will be diagnosed with dementia,&#xD;
      including Alzheimer's disease by 2060. Older African Americans adults are more likely to be&#xD;
      diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease as compared to Whites. Research search studies on high&#xD;
      blood pressure show that African Americans have higher levels of the hormone aldosterone that&#xD;
      can be involved with regulation of blood pressure and blood vessels. Research studies also&#xD;
      show that changes in blood vessels in the brain from higher aldosterone levels are related to&#xD;
      changes in thinking skills and memory (cognition). Spironolactone is a drug that blocks&#xD;
      aldosterone and has been used to treat high blood pressure for 60 years. More recently, this&#xD;
      drug has shown to have the potential to decrease declines in thinking skills and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spironolactone is widely used in clinical practice and is well-tolerated by younger and older&#xD;
      persons. As such, this study is designed to learn how a small group of older African American&#xD;
      adults with mild cognitive impairment will tolerate the drug. Persons who are eligible for&#xD;
      the study and agree to participate will receive spironolactone or a placebo and be monitored&#xD;
      for drug side effects for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the researchers will monitor changes in thinking and memory and blood&#xD;
      vessel stiffness, in addition to side effects that may be related to the drug. Study tests&#xD;
      include questionnaires that evaluate thinking skills and memory, and an ultrasound that&#xD;
      measures the stiffness of blood vessels in the neck which deliver blood to the brain. The&#xD;
      thinking and memory tests and ultrasound will be performed at the beginning of the study,&#xD;
      then repeated at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study can justify a larger size study of spironolactone in older African&#xD;
      Americans with mild cognitive impairment. The study has the potential to identify a new use&#xD;
      for a well-known drug that is safe and widely used in current clinical practice. Further, the&#xD;
      results from this study can address a racial difference in Alzheimer's disease and preserve&#xD;
      the health of the brain as people age.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Trail Making Test Part A Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>In Part A of the Trail Making Test (TMT) participants are presented with a sheet of paper with 25 circles numbered 1 through 25. Participants are asked to draw lines connecting the circles in ascending order of the numbers. The task is scored as the amount of time it takes in seconds for the circles to be correctly connected. The average time to complete the task is 29 seconds. Times greater than 78 seconds indicate cognitive impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change in Trail Making Test Part B Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Part B of the Trail Making Test (TMT) includes a sheet of paper with circles with numbers (1-13) and letters (A-L). Participants are asked to draw lines connecting the circles in ascending order of the numbers and letters, alternating between numbers and letters. The task is scored as the amount of time it takes in seconds for the circles to be correctly connected. The average time to complete the task is 75 seconds. Times greater than 273 seconds indicate cognitive impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>In the HVLT-R recall task, there are three trials where participants hear 12 words which they are asked to recall. The Total Recall score is the sum of correct responses over the three trials. Total scores range from 0 to 36 where higher scores indicate better recall.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>In the HVLT-R delayed recall task, participants hear 12 words and are asked to recall the words after waiting 20-25 minutes. The score is the sum of correctly recalled words and the score ranges from 0 to 12, where higher values indicate better delayed recall.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) Recognition Discrimination Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>In the HVLT-R recognition task, participants hear 24 words (half of which they have heard before) and are asked each each word has been previously presented. The recognition discrimination is calculated as the number of true positives minus the number of false positives during the recognition task. Index scores can range from -12 to 12 with higher scores indicating better recognition discrimination.</description>

    <description>The Digit Span test being used is a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Third Edition (WAIS-III) and assesses immediate memory and attention. Participants are asked to repeat strings of numbers forwards and backwards. The score is the number of digits that are repeated correctly. Higher scores indicate improved memory and attention.</description>
