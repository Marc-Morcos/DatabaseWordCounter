  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will recruit in total 39&#xD;
      participants with either Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI) or Mild&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease dementia (mild AD). There will be 3 Dose levels. An initial cohort of 13&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to a Dose level 1 (0.1 mg/kg vs. placebo) lasting 8 weeks. An&#xD;
      additional 13 subjects will be recruited and randomized into Dose level 2 (0.25 mg/kg vs.&#xD;
      placebo) for 8 weeks and 13 subjects for the last Dose level 3 (0.5 mg/kg vs. placebo) for 8&#xD;
      weeks. The primary objective will be to assess safety and tolerability of CpG 1018.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomly allocated in a blinded fashion to receive s.c. injection of either CpG ODN (dose level 1, 0.1 mg/kg) or placebo (saline). Dose escalation will occur after 10 weeks after the last injection in a new subject cohort, and will be based on the safety data and immunostimulatory assessments at previous dose level cohorts.</intervention_model_description>
