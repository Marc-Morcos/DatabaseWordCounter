  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores the acute exercise effect on neurocognitive function and also its&#xD;
      potential moderators in an exercise setting and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genetic risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute exercise has emerged as a modifier to multiple aspects of cognitive function; however,&#xD;
      its effect on populations with different risks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the role of&#xD;
      exercise variance and APOE genotype within the effect reminds underestimated. The current&#xD;
      study aimed to examine the acute exercise effect on neurocognitive function from behavioral&#xD;
      and neuroelectric perspectives among cognitively normal late-middle-aged adults.&#xD;
      Additionally, we determined whether variations in exercise intensity and duration and the&#xD;
      presence of the APOE É›4 allele modulated the effect.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The present study adopted a counterbalanced design. All participants were instructed to complete four counterbalanced treatments: a) longer duration (LI-40), b) moderate-intensity with 30 min (MI-30), c) high-intensity with shorter duration (HI-16), and d) control treatments.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Participants were required to complete the Stroop task approximately 30 min following the cessation of each acute exercise treatment or the 30-min reading.</time_frame>
    <description>A computerized Stroop task was used to assess participants' inhibitory control and basic information processing. The response time of the correct responses was calculated for the first behavioral index.</description>

    <measure>Event-related potential: P3 amplitude</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were required to complete the Stroop task while EEG activity was continuously recorded approximately 30 min following the cessation of each acute exercise treatment or the 30-min reading.</time_frame>
    <description>The event-related potential from parietal electrodes (i.e., P3, Pz, and P4) were initially outputted for the mean P3 amplitude; the averaged mean P3 amplitudes from parietal electrodes was then calculated as the neuroelectrical indices.</description>
