  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral functioning changes with age in order to respond to the impacts of different&#xD;
      external and internal factors on the brain, and more generally on the human body. Scaffolding&#xD;
      Theory of Aging and Cognition proposes that during life the brain develops specific neural&#xD;
      networks to handle with cognitive activities. When these networks are impaired due to factors&#xD;
      that damage brain structure and/or brain functioning, the brain adapts and elaborates new&#xD;
      networks to cope with this situation. A cognitive reserve built throughout life and an&#xD;
      appropriated care such as for example cognitive training, are in the centre of this model&#xD;
      because they are involved in building these networks. In general, studies exploring cognitive&#xD;
      training in normal aging and in patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease such as&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease have shown some benefits of the training on cognitive functioning. It has&#xD;
      been shown not only that the cognitive training improves older adults' cognition, but also&#xD;
      that these effects last for a long time and positively influence older people everyday&#xD;
      activities. In fact, the benefits from memory training were observed 5 years after the end of&#xD;
      the training and those of reasoning and of speed of processing even after 10 years. In&#xD;
      addition, majority of the participants declared to notice improvement of their everyday life.&#xD;
      Concerning Alzheimer's disease, several studies have observed positive results of cognitive&#xD;
      training although there are some controversies about its' effects. Numerous studies point out&#xD;
      that for cognitive training being the most efficient, the intervention has to take place as&#xD;
      early as possible, preferentially in a premorbid stage of the disease and that it is&#xD;
      important to propose trainings that minimize the withdrawal. In this sense, the importance of&#xD;
      using computer based training was put forward because it allows the elaboration of multiple&#xD;
      exercises with playful aspect and more importantly it can adapt on line the difficulty of the&#xD;
      exercises to the patient's performance. However, if it is commonly admitted that computer&#xD;
      based training has an important role in physician's, psychologist's or speech therapist's&#xD;
      office less is known about the efficiency of this type of training performed at distance, at&#xD;
      the patient's place of residence. It seems probable that to propose distance training as an&#xD;
      additional training to that performed in a practitioner's office would increase training&#xD;
      benefits. To investigators knowledge this was not investigated in a systematic way with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease patients. The more important advantages of a such additional training&#xD;
      are: (1) reduction of patients' travelling, (2) increased flexibility of training scheduling&#xD;
      and (3) increased frequency of training sessions per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in the present study investigators will examine in a systematic way, whether the&#xD;
      distance training, as an additional training to this performed in practitioner's office,&#xD;
      brings incremental short- and long-term benefits coming from cognitive training in mild to&#xD;
      moderate Alzheimer's disease patients. Investigators second objective is to determine what&#xD;
      would be the best frequency per week of such an additional training.&#xD;

    <description>Participant will perform 1-hour cognitive computer based training one time per week in a practitioner's office during 4 months (16 weeks of training = 16 hours of training). This training will include 10 short tasks of increasing difficulty. Performance of these tasks involve cognitive functions such as: executive functions, reasoning, auditive, visual and visuo-spatial memory, speed of processing, short-term memory and working memory. Thus the training aims to exercise all these cognitive functions.</description>
