      The purpose of this study is to measure effects on CSF biomarkers, EEG and safety with&#xD;
      REM0046127 oral suspension compared with placebo in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study duration will be up to 2 months for each treated subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each subject will start with a 14-day placebo run-in period, followed by a 28-day&#xD;
           treatment period and 7-day follow-up period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit frequency: every week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of Subjects: at least 30 subjects with an upper limit of 60 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Arms and Duration: All subjects will be randomized (1:1:1 allocation) to one&#xD;
           ofthree different starting levels after the 14-day run-in period:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  REM0046127 high dose: 1400mg (700mg bid) oral suspension per day for 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  REM0046127 low dose: 350mg (175mg bid) oral suspension per day for 28 days&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      REM0046127 is a small molecule intended for the oral treatment of subjects suffering from&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pharmacological mechanism of REM0046127 is based on modulating&#xD;
      Orai calcium (Ca2+) channel activity to normalize neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis in ADdiseased&#xD;
      neurons. This mechanism is central in the AD-disease cascade and is therefore expected to&#xD;
      modulate fast-acting mechanisms like restoration of impaired synaptic function, neuronal&#xD;
      network activity (EEG), secretion of tau into CSF and synaptic CSF biomarkers to improve&#xD;
      cognition (symptomatic). It is also expected to influence processes with slower kinetics like&#xD;
      brain amyloid plaques formation and neuronal cell death to slow or even stop disease&#xD;
      progression over time (neuroprotection).&#xD;
