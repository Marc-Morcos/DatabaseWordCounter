      A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be performed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of treating AR1001 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      for 26 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in The United&#xD;
      States affecting approximately 5.4 million Americans. AD is characterized by progressive loss&#xD;
      in memory and as well as a decline in the ability to learn that is associated with neuronal&#xD;
      death. Well known hallmarks of AD are neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and&#xD;
      extensive inflammation. Currently, no treatment has been developed to fully cure or prevent&#xD;
      the progression of dementia that is associated with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AR1001 is a polypharmacological drug candidate being developed as a treatment for AD and&#xD;
      shows great potential with favorable attributes for a central nervous system (CNS) drug&#xD;
      (i.e., high specificity and potency, as well as good pharmacokinetic, bioavailability, CNS&#xD;
      penetration, and ensured safety).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study of AR1001 aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AR1001 as a&#xD;
      potential treatment for AD. Based on the preclinical results, AR1001 could be an effective&#xD;
      treatment option with a mechanism of action that has not been explored for AD indication.&#xD;
