    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of UC-MSC&#xD;
      (Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell) .This study is also to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of this treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, most AD patients who seek treatment already have neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary&#xD;
      tangles, and neurodegeneration. At this stage of the disease, perhaps a multi-faceted&#xD;
      approach to halt the toxicity of amyloid-β peptides and promote cell survival and/or replace&#xD;
      lost cells would be most beneficial.Most of the treatments for Alzheimer disease are chemical&#xD;
      drug which can improve the symptoms but is not able to inhibit the disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that are being clinically explored as a&#xD;
      new therapeutic for treating a variety of immune-mediated diseases.Preclinical studies of the&#xD;
      mechanism of action suggest that the therapeutic effects afforded by MSC transplantation are&#xD;
      short-lived and related to dynamic, paracrine interactions between MSCs and host&#xD;
      cells.Clinical trials of MSCs thus far have shown no adverse reactions to allogeneic versus&#xD;
      autologous MSC transplants. Clinical studies showed that umbilical cord derived MSC is&#xD;
      immunologically stable and not toxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of UC-MSC (Human Umbilical&#xD;
      Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell).This study is also to investigate the efficacy of this&#xD;
      treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
