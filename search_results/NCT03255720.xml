      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, accountings for&#xD;
      60-70% of all demented cases. It is a neuro-pathological diagnosis determined by presence of&#xD;
      neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques in the brain of patients with dementia. The&#xD;
      disease frequently starts with memory impairment, but is invariably followed by a progressive&#xD;
      global cognitive impairment. The major risk factor for Alzheimer disease is age, with&#xD;
      prevalence doubling every 5 years after the age of 65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of Alzheimer's typically involves physical and neurological exams, as medical&#xD;
      history and mental status evaluation, laboratory investigations and it involves brain imaging&#xD;
      (such as MRI) which could identify other causes of problems such as stroke, tumor or head&#xD;
      trauma. By physical and neurological examination, Alzheimer's disease characterized by&#xD;
      gradual onset and progressive decline in cognition with sparring of motor and sensory&#xD;
      function until later stages; the average course of Alzheimer's disease is approximately a&#xD;
      decade, with a range of 3 to 20 years duration from diagnosis to death .Memory impairment is&#xD;
      present in the earliest stages of the disease; patients have difficulty learning new&#xD;
      information and retaining it for more than few minutes. As the disease advances, the ability&#xD;
      to learn increasingly compromised, more distant memories are lost. Other cognitive loses&#xD;
      include aphasia, apraxia, disorientation and impaired judgment. Cognitive impairment affects&#xD;
      daily life; patients have difficulty planning meals, managing finances or medication, using&#xD;
      telephone, driving. Many capacities may remain intact until later stages including&#xD;
      performance of self-care activities of daily living as eating, bathing. Patients evidence&#xD;
      personality alteration, irritability, anxiety, depression. Delusion, hallucination and&#xD;
      aggression. Laboratory Evaluation includes Biochemical markers as measurement of&#xD;
      Cerebrospinal fluid including Tau protein, amyloid beta peptides or neural thread protein and&#xD;
      measurement of urinary biomarkers including neural thread protein. Also testing including Apo&#xD;
      lipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele presenilin genes, amyloid precursor gene or TREM2. Diffusion&#xD;
      tensor imaging (DTI) is an imaging technology based on magnetic resonance diffusion weighted&#xD;
      imaging, which can make quantitative analysis of anisotropy of water molecules in different&#xD;
      directions, so as to observe the microstructure of tissues non-invasively. So Diffusion&#xD;
      tensor imaging can provide information of fiber orientation, the injury of fiber, and&#xD;
      membrane permeability which cannot be obtained from conventional MRI. Diffusion tensor&#xD;
      imaging enables mapping of White matter microstructure changes in development, aging and&#xD;
      neurological disorders, From the tensor, it's possible to derive the mean diffusivity (DM)&#xD;
      and the fractional anisotropy (FA) which is the most robust measures of anisotropy which&#xD;
      measure the degree of deviation from isotropic diffusion. ). More recently, an additional&#xD;
      DT-MRI derived index has been proposed .This index measures the degree of similarity of&#xD;
      orientation of neighboring voxels and its named inter-voxel coherence (C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      So Diffusion tensor imaging has therefore become a powerful technique in the study of&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases in recent years.&#xD;
