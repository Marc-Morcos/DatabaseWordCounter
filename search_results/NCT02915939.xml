    <textblock>
      Emerging research on family caregiving and institutionalization has emphasized that families&#xD;
      do not disengage from care responsibilities following a relative's admission to residential&#xD;
      long-term care settings. The Residential Care Transition Module (RCTM) provides 6 formal&#xD;
      sessions of consultation (one-to-one and family sessions) over a 4-month period to those&#xD;
      family caregivers who have admitted a cognitively impaired relative to a residential&#xD;
      long-term care setting (nursing home, assisted living memory care unit). The proposed mixed&#xD;
      method, randomized controlled trial will determine whether and how the RCTM decreases family&#xD;
      caregivers' emotional and psychological distress, placement-related strain, and increases&#xD;
      relative's transitions back to the community. The RCTM will fill an important clinical and&#xD;
      research gap by evaluating a psychosocial intervention designed for families following RLTC&#xD;
      placement to determine whether and how this approach can help families better navigate the&#xD;
      residential care transitions of relatives with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Emerging research on family caregiving and institutionalization has found that families do&#xD;
      not disengage from care responsibilities following relatives' admissions to residential&#xD;
      long-term care settings. Families instead remain involved in a spectrum of care activities&#xD;
      ranging from instrumental activities of daily living to emotional support. Perhaps for these&#xD;
      reasons, a number of studies have noted that caregiving stress, depression, or other key&#xD;
      outcomes remain stable or sometimes increase following residential long-term care (RLTC)&#xD;
      entry for certain types of caregivers. A few interventions have attempted to increase family&#xD;
      involvement after institutionalization, but no rigorous studies have demonstrated that these&#xD;
      interventions are effective in helping families navigate transitions to RLTC environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Residential Care Transition Module (RCTM) provides 6 formal sessions of consultation&#xD;
      (one-to-one and family sessions) over a 4-month period to those family caregivers who have&#xD;
      recently admitted a relative to a RLTC setting. In this randomized controlled trial, family&#xD;
      members who have admitted a cognitively impaired relative to a RLTC setting will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the RCTM [(n = 120)] or a usual care control condition [(n = 120)]. A mixed&#xD;
      methods analysis will be used to pursue the following aims: Specific Aim 1: Assess whether&#xD;
      the RCTM yields statistically significant reductions in family members' primary subjective&#xD;
      stress and negative mental health outcomes; Specific Aim 2) Determine whether family members&#xD;
      who receive the RCTM will indicate statistically significant decreases in secondary role&#xD;
      strains over a 12-month period when compared to usual care controls; Specific Aim 3)&#xD;
      Determine whether RCTM family members report statistically significant decreases in&#xD;
      residential care stress when compared to family members in the usual care control group; and&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4) Delineate the mechanism of action of RCTM under conditions of high and low&#xD;
      success by &quot;embedding&quot; qualitative components (30 semi-structured interviews) at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the 12-month evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will fill an important clinical and research gap by evaluating a&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention designed for families following RLTC placement that determines&#xD;
      whether and how the RCTM can help families better navigate the residential care transitions&#xD;
      of cognitively impaired relatives.&#xD;

    <description>Residential Care Transition Module sessions focus on the experiences of the caregiver, the care recipient, and (potentially) other family members immediately following residential long-term care (RLTC) admission. The sessions are designed to establish a therapeutic rapport with the caregiver and the family; provide a safe environment to explore stressors; examine family relational dynamics as they relate to the RLTC placement decision itself as well as the roles different family members play in the life of the caregiver and relative in RLTC; identify new modes of communication to facilitate more effective interactions with other family members and care staff; and identify effective ways to advocate for improved quality of care for and quality of life of their relatives in RLTC.</description>
