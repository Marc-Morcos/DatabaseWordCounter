  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic education expands in Alzheimer's Disease management in France. Several studies&#xD;
      revealed a positive impact on caregiver's burden and/or quality of life. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study, is to determine whether a therapeutic educational programme for both AD patients and&#xD;
      primary caregivers, in community dwelling, improves patient's quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine whether a therapeutic educational programme for both AD&#xD;
      patients, in community dwelling, and their primary caregivers improves patient's quality of&#xD;
      life, after two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design : This study is a monocentric randomised controlled intervention trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population : One hundred and seventy dyads 'patient-caregiver' in which the patient suffers&#xD;
      from mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease patients (MMSE 11 to 26), lives in&#xD;
      community dwelling and has a primary caregiver will be included during eighteen months. The&#xD;
      primary caregiver is define as a person living with the patient or providing care at least 3&#xD;
      times a week or 8 hours per week; he/she isn't a professional. Eighty five dyad will be&#xD;
      include in the intervention group (group A) and eighty five in the control group (group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome : Our primary endpoint is the AD patient's quality of life assessed by Logsdon's&#xD;
      Quality of life in Alzheimer's Disease scale (Qol-AD) reported by the caregiver at two&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary endpoints are caregiver's burden assessed by the Zarit Burden Inventory,&#xD;
      frequency and severity of behavioural and psychological symptoms assessed by the Neuro&#xD;
      Psychiatric Inventory, independence in personal and instrumental daily life activities&#xD;
      assessed by Katz's Activities of Daily Living and Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily&#xD;
      Living scales, and caregiver's quality of life assessed by the Nottingham Health Profile at 6&#xD;
      months. The patient quality of life will also be recorded at 12 months on the logsdon's&#xD;
      Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease scale reported, and at every visit (MO, M2, M6, et&#xD;
      M12) on the same scale dut (QoL-AD) reported by the patient himself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is a therapeutic educational programme. It includes two consultations for&#xD;
      the dyad AD patient/caregiver and four group sessions, one a week, for caregivers only. The&#xD;
      intervention length is 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group (n=85) will benefit from an educational programme that includes two&#xD;
      consultations for the dyad AD patient/caregiver and four group sessions for caregivers only.&#xD;
      The two consultations will be held at baseline (MO) and two months later (M2); the first one&#xD;
      (MO)will include : the 'educational diagnosis', the comprehensive assessment of the patient&#xD;
      and assessment of the judgement criteria. Between MO and M2 the primary caregivers will&#xD;
      participate to four collective sessions one per week about, of 3 hours length : 1- Knowledge&#xD;
      of the disease; 2- Pharmacological and non pharmacological treatments. Behavioural and&#xD;
      psychological symptoms of dementia 3- Crisis situations. Prevention of caregiver's exhaustion&#xD;
      4- Assistive devices and care pathways. At M2, the dyad will benefit from : assessment of&#xD;
      response to the educational objectives and of the judgement criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group (n=85) will benefit from routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be implemented over an eighteen month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring will consist of a two consultations to 6 and 12 months including assessment of&#xD;
      primary and secondary judgment criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected in Access data basis and SAS software will be used to perform&#xD;
      statistic analysis. Intention to treat analysis using linear mixed model will be performed,&#xD;
      adjusting for patient (disease severity), caregiver characteristics (burden) and occurence of&#xD;
      life event that may interfere with the patient's quality of life.&#xD;
