  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LUCINDA Trial is a three-site, phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study of leuprolide acetate (Eligard) in women with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease taking a stable dose of donepezil (Aricept.) Its objective is to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      of a 48-week regimen of leuprolide (22.5 mg per 12 weeks) compared to placebo on cognitive&#xD;
      function, global function and plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to re-purpose the safe and well-tolerated gonadotropin-releasing hormone&#xD;
      (GnRH) analogue Leuprolide Acetate for use in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Leuprolide Acetate is&#xD;
      currently used in adults for prostate cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids and in&#xD;
      preparation for in-vitro fertilization, and in children for central precocious puberty. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study to confirm and extend results from a prior phase II study (Bowen et al,&#xD;
      2015) which demonstrated that Leuprolide halted cognitive and functional decline in a&#xD;
      subgroup of women with mild-moderate AD who were also taking the acetylcholinesterase&#xD;
      inhibitor donepezil. Objectives are to replicate, in the same subgroup, Leuprolide's clinical&#xD;
      EFFICACY in this prior trial and to add neuroimaging and plasma BIOMARKERS that will help&#xD;
      elucidate Leuprolide's likely multiple mechanisms of action in AD. These mechanisms include&#xD;
      decreasing levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) based on extensive preclinical evidence that&#xD;
      decreasing LH preserves cognition and decreases amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation in&#xD;
      animal models of AD, as well as new evidence that GnRH analogues may have anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
