    <textblock>
      One of the crucial challenges for the future of Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches in elderly is to target the main pathological process responsible for disability&#xD;
      and dependency. However, a progressive cognitive impairment occurring after the age of 70 is&#xD;
      often related to mixed lesions of neurodegenerative and vascular origins. Whereas young&#xD;
      patients are mostly affected by pure lesions, aging favors the occurrence of co-lesions of&#xD;
      AD, vascular and Lewy body types. Pure DLB (Dementia with Lewy Body) and AD are distinct&#xD;
      disorders but they often coexist in old age patients, the Abeta pathology of DLB/AD cases&#xD;
      being different to that observed in patients with AD alone. Vascular dementia (VD) and AD&#xD;
      with cerebrovascular disease (AD+CVD) are the leading causes of dementia next to AD alone.&#xD;
      Lack of consensus persists about the diagnosis criteria for VD and AD+CVD, due in part to&#xD;
      their clinical, pathological heterogeneity and the multiple pathological subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We do not know the precise role and weight of each brain lesion type in the disability&#xD;
      progression in elderly. To target the actual pathological process, we need to disclose the&#xD;
      functional weight of AD, Lewy body and vascular lesion types in elderly. Most of the studies&#xD;
      report on functional and clinical abnormalities in patients with pure pathologies. Thus,&#xD;
      co-morbid processes involved in the transition from an independent functional status to&#xD;
      disability in the elderly with co-lesions still remain to be elucidated. Neuropathological&#xD;
      examination often performed at late stages cannot answer this question at mild or moderate&#xD;
      stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain MRI, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) with DaTscan® and CSF&#xD;
      biomarkers help routinely in performing the diagnosis of pure or mixed lesions responsible&#xD;
      for dementia. The topography of the atrophy in MRI helps to provide information about the&#xD;
      etiological diagnosis. Medial temporal lobe atrophy on MRI has good discriminatory power for&#xD;
      AD compared to DLB and VD in pathologically confirmed cases. DaTscan® SPECT presents with&#xD;
      good sensitivity and specificity at early stages of DLB. The good diagnosis value of CSF&#xD;
      biological markers has led recently to their inclusion in the research diagnosis criteria of&#xD;
      AD. Low Aβ1-42 and high levels of total tau and hyperphosphorylated tau isoforms appear to be&#xD;
      the most sensitive and specific CSF biomarkers. Aβ1-42 is lowered in AD, as well as in other&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases like DLB, VD. The combination of MRI, particularly medial temporal&#xD;
      atrophy measures and vascular lesions on FLAIR MRI sequences, SPECT and CSF biomarkers seem&#xD;
      to be of incremental value for the diagnosis AD, VD, DLB and mixed profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify the biomarkers (MRI, SPECT-DaTscan® and CSF), and their&#xD;
      combination, that are the most predictive of functional disability in elderly presenting with&#xD;
      a progressive cognitive decline related to AD, DLB, VD and all mixed patterns.&#xD;
