  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an important unmet need for timely, non-invasive, and low-burden evaluation of&#xD;
      patients presenting with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia. MCI impacts&#xD;
      12-18% of people in the United States over age 60 and is often an initial clinical sign of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Alzheimer's Association, 2022). The PrecivityAD test is an&#xD;
      analytically and clinically validated blood test that aids healthcare providers in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of AD in patients with MCI and early-stage dementia. C2N has created a quality&#xD;
      improvement (QI) survey to gather insight from clinicians as to the clinical effectiveness of&#xD;
      the commercially available PrecivityADâ„¢ test, which identifies whether a patient with signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of cognitive decline is likely to have amyloid plaques in the brain, a&#xD;
      pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

      By gathering feedback from healthcare providers on patient selection, intended use, and&#xD;
      anticipated outcomes and continued or revised care plans as a result of the test report, C2N&#xD;
      can better understand the impact of the test results on diagnosis and patient management.&#xD;

        Neurologists actively practicing in the United States were asked to complete the QI 1.0&#xD;
        survey with expertise in caring for patients with mild cognitive impairment and knowledge&#xD;
        of Alzheimer's Disease in terms of expertise and volume of patients served. This may&#xD;
        include nurse practitioners or physician assistants who work in the field of neurology.&#xD;
