      MAIN TRIAL: Nearly half of older adults report problems with function, which can lead to&#xD;
      difficulty with activities of daily living and nursing home placement. Thus, there is a need&#xD;
      to implement evidence-based models of care to improve function and those factors that support&#xD;
      function in older adults living in the community. One such model is CAPABLE, a&#xD;
      person-centered, nurse and occupational therapy intervention supported by assistive devices&#xD;
      and home modifications. The investigators build on prior work that translated CAPABLE and&#xD;
      conducted preliminary testing of a package of implementation strategies. This R15 application&#xD;
      will test site-level adoption and sustainability after deploying a package of implementation&#xD;
      strategies (readiness assessment, training, facilitation, champions, coalition building, and&#xD;
      audit and feedback). Sites will be randomized to internal facilitation alone or internal&#xD;
      facilitation plus external facilitation. This work will impact implementation science by&#xD;
      testing two approaches to implementation of an evidence-based intervention to improve&#xD;
      outcomes among older adults in a Medicaid Waiver program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT We extend the Parent Trial by addressing a problem found while&#xD;
      deploying CAPABLE with beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia. There are&#xD;
      39.8 million informal caregivers in the US and 16.3 million who care for someone with AD or&#xD;
      dementia; and 1,500 of those are in the Michigan waiver. Most beneficiaries with those&#xD;
      conditions did not accept CAPABLE as they were unable to receive instruction. Interventions&#xD;
      that improve caregiver knowledge, confidence, and self-efficacy improve care they provide.&#xD;
      Thus, the goal is to extend provision of CAPABLE to beneficiaries with AD or dementia via the&#xD;
      engagement of their informal caregivers. This work is significant as there are 1,500&#xD;
      beneficiaries with AD or dementia in the waiver who could benefit from CAPABLE yet many did&#xD;
      not, as they were to receive instructions. To date, CAPABLE has only been designed to be used&#xD;
      directly with the individuals without caregiver involvement. In the waiver, beneficiaries are&#xD;
      required to have a designated caregiver, therefore, modifying the toolkit for use by&#xD;
      caregivers could aid in deploying CAPABLE to beneficiaries with AD or dementia.&#xD;

      MAIN TRIAL: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines Implementation Science (IS) as&#xD;
      the process of applying evidence to the treatment or prevention of human disease. In&#xD;
      response, this trial is significant because it addresses testing of multimodal implementation&#xD;
      strategies of an evidence-based intervention (CAPABLE) in a Medicaid setting to improve the&#xD;
      quality and effectiveness of a waiver. Investigators will utilize implementation strategies&#xD;
      refined in prior work (MiCAP; Hartford/Hillman/CMS) where the investigators trained&#xD;
      clinicians (N=34) and provided CAPABLE for beneficiaries (N=270).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this application, the investigators extend their work and train &quot;all&quot; Registered Nurses&#xD;
      (RNs), Occupational Therapists (OTs), and Social Workers (SWs) (N=575) in the waiver sites in&#xD;
      Michigan to implement the CAPABLE model of care for &quot;all&quot; Medicaid waiver beneficiaries&#xD;
      (N=15,000). Guided by site managers, the team will select and train Internal Facilitators&#xD;
      (IFs), who are supervisors/employees that work for the waiver site, to conduct facilitation&#xD;
      at each site as &quot;Champions&quot;. Investigators will utilize waiver employees as External&#xD;
      Facilitators (EFs), who were early adopters of CAPABLE in prior work, as &quot;Super-Champions&quot;&#xD;
      for Arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is also significant as it addresses a critical barrier to implementation of&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions to improve function in older adults living in the community to&#xD;
      age-in-place (CAPABLE). Evidence suggest 90% of older adults prefer to age-in-place; yet a&#xD;
      gap exists between their desire and ability. Thus, further testing of efficacy of an&#xD;
      intervention (CAPABLE) in a Medicaid waiver population will fill a gap in science and build&#xD;
      upon evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Institute of Medicine, NIH, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality have each&#xD;
      established IS as a research priority so that the benefits of evidence-based interventions&#xD;
      can be realized. Consequently, strategies (MiCAP) to overcome barriers and increase the pace&#xD;
      and the effectiveness of implementation are a public health priority. The multimodal&#xD;
      implementation strategies (MiCAP N=6) include: assessing readiness, conducting training,&#xD;
      using IF Champions, building an IF coalition, and audit and feedback is adequate.&#xD;
      Additionally, investigators will examine if the additive EF is required to support adoption&#xD;
      and sustainability of an evidence-based intervention (CAPABLE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disabilities in basic activities of daily living (ADLs [e.g., bathing, toileting]) and&#xD;
      instrumental ADLs (IADL [e.g., shopping, cleaning]) are the primary modifiable predictors of&#xD;
      nursing home (NH) placement. Disability is also a major driver of increased risk of falls and&#xD;
      may lead to poor quality-of-life. Disability creates an inability to carry out everyday ADLs.&#xD;
      There are a number of risks for disability like complex medication regimens, poor balance and&#xD;
      strength, inadequate communication with clinicians, falling, and unsafe ADL performance. In&#xD;
      addition, unsafe environments and deteriorated housing increase risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this problem, the evidence-based intervention, CAPABLE, addresses modifiable&#xD;
      intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors and considers the psychological, environmental, and&#xD;
      physical factors to enhance function of disabled individuals and promote aging-in-place. A&#xD;
      multi-component model of care, CAPABLE was designed to reduce the effect of problems with&#xD;
      physical function among low-income older adults living at home by addressing an individual's&#xD;
      capabilities and the home environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAPABLE was adapted from the ABLE program. ABLE used a person-directed, consultative model&#xD;
      involving 6 home sessions conducted by OTs and physical therapists who provided home&#xD;
      alterations (assistive devices [e.g., shower chair, reacher, raised toilet seat],&#xD;
      environmental modifications [e.g., grab bar, ramps], and select home modifications [e.g.,&#xD;
      widen bathroom doorway]) and instruction in various techniques to enable participants to&#xD;
      achieve self-identified functional goals. CAPABLE is a 16-week structured program delivered&#xD;
      by OTs who conduct 6 home visits and provide assistive devices, RNs who conduct 4 home&#xD;
      visits, and a repairperson who provides home alterations (i.e., installs devices,&#xD;
      environmental modifications, and home repair). CAPABLE's interdisciplinary team provides&#xD;
      consultation with older adults to help them identify daily activity goals (e.g., taking a&#xD;
      shower, walking to the bathroom), evaluate barriers to achieving those goals, and attain&#xD;
      outcomes collaboratively. The OT addresses ADLs, IADLs, and discretionary activities at home&#xD;
      such as functional mobility, meal preparation, bathing, and dressing. The RN targets&#xD;
      underlying issues that influence ADLs, IADLs, and discretionary activities at home, such as&#xD;
      pain reduction, improvement in mood, fall prevention, medication review and management,&#xD;
      primary care physician communication, incontinence management, sexual health, and smoking&#xD;
      cessation. CAPABLE draws upon approaches to enhance uptake and adoption of strategies by&#xD;
      patients by assessing readiness and using motivational interviewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the investigators move IS forward by examining a multimodal implementation&#xD;
      strategy (MiCAP) approach to implement evidence (CAPABLE) in a Medicaid Waiver program. To&#xD;
      fill an IS gap, investigators will use proven implementation strategies that are packaged&#xD;
      (MiCAP) and delivered to clinicians in the waiver program sites to support beneficiary&#xD;
      improvement in function and those factors that influence function in older disabled adults&#xD;
      aging-in-place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT There is a paucity of literature on caregiver provision of&#xD;
      assessment or direct care to individuals with AD or dementia, as most discuss burden,&#xD;
      confidence, stress, depression, or health. In 2005, the AARP used a Delphi technique to&#xD;
      identify caregiver competency domains of medical/nursing skills, assessment, measurement,&#xD;
      collaborating, and communication. A review of caregiver training programs found problem&#xD;
      solving, use of community resources, and communication to be the primary focus. Physical or&#xD;
      emotional assessment, medical/nursing skills training, home exercises, medication management,&#xD;
      or planning, like what is needed when delivering CAPABLE, appeared to be lacking in caregiver&#xD;
      training. Regarding toolkit usage, Powell and colleagues recommend using toolkits when&#xD;
      implementing interventions, and our parent trial uses a beneficiary toolkit. A recent review&#xD;
      of 72 studies evaluating use of toolkits (i.e. weight management, fall prevention,&#xD;
      vaccination, pain management, and patient safety) found 57% reported adherence to clinical&#xD;
      procedures and toolkit effects were positive. This finding supports use of a toolkit with&#xD;
      caregivers when CAPABLE is deployed with beneficiaries with AD or dementia. Many older adults&#xD;
      cared for by informal caregivers have unmet needs. A 44.3% (38.2% ADL related, 14.6% IADL&#xD;
      related) unmet need rate is common among older adults with caregivers. Higher rates of unmet&#xD;
      needs are likely in beneficiaries in the waiver as they are multi-morbid and low-income with&#xD;
      few resources and even worse in those with AD or dementia.&#xD;

    <description>The Stages of Implementation Completion is an 8-stage tool of implementation process and milestones, with stages spanning 3 phases. Three scores are derived: 1) number of stages completed; 2) time spent in each stage; and 3) proportion of activities completed in each stage. Number of stages completed is a count of progression through stages; the score is the last stage in which at least one activity was performed. Time spent in each stage is calculated by taking the difference between the date of completion of the first activity and the date of completion of the last activity in the same stage. Complete all 8 stages: the final completion date is logged in stage 8. For sites that chose to discontinue implementation, the date is logged in the furthest stage that the site enters. Proportion of activities completed is calculated as number of activities completed divided by number of possible activities in each stage.</description>

    <description>Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS-50) is a 50-item tool that assesses mental health and social service providers' attitudes toward adopting EBP. The EBPAS-50 covers 12 subscales: appeal, requirements, openness, divergence, limitations, fit, monitoring, balance, burden, job security, organizational support, and feedback. The 12 subdomains sum up in a higher order total scale score representing respondent's global attitudes toward EBP. Responses are given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-&quot;not at all&quot; to 4-&quot;to a very great extent&quot;. In order to assess different perspectives and to reduce response biases, 23 items belonging to five subscales (divergence, limitations, monitoring, balance, and burden) are negatively framed. For the total score these items are reversed scored, and the mean subscale scores recomputed, before a mean score for the total EBPAS-50 item score is computed. A higher total score indicate a more positive attitude towards adoption of EBP.</description>
