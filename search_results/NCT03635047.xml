  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation first&#xD;
      in human (FIH) study in healthy adults and in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. The study is designed to systematically assess the safety (including immunogenicity)&#xD;
      and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of AL002.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the single ascending dose (SAD) phase up to approximately 56 healthy adult participants&#xD;
      will be sequentially enrolled into up to approximately 9 cohorts In the multiple-dose (MD)&#xD;
      phase, approximately 32 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease will be enrolled&#xD;
      in three cohorts.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Total body weight between 50 and 120 kg, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical laboratory evaluations (including chemistry panel fasted [fasted at least 8&#xD;
             hours], complete blood count (CBC), and urine analysis) within the reference range for&#xD;
             the test laboratory, unless deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator. A&#xD;
             count of the segmented neutrophils and bands should be performed when results from the&#xD;
             white blood cells (WBCs) are not within the reference range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Negative test for selected drugs of abuse at screening (does not include alcohol) and&#xD;
             at admission (testing at admission does include alcohol breath test). A positive&#xD;
             result may be verified by re-testing (up to one false positive result permitted) and&#xD;
             may be followed up at the discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Females must be non-pregnant and non-lactating, and either surgically sterile&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In good health, determined by no clinically significant findings from medical history,&#xD;
             physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory tests, and vital&#xD;
             signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For MD cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ages 50-85 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;

             guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Availability of a person (&quot;study partner&quot;) who, in the Investigator's judgment, has&#xD;
             frequent and sufficient contact with the participant and is able to provide accurate&#xD;
             information regarding the participant's cognitive and functional abilities, agrees to&#xD;
             provide information at clinic visits, which require partner input for scale&#xD;
             completion, and signs the necessary consent form, per local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease dementia based on National&#xD;
             Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Association criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or lactating, or intending to become pregnant within 16 weeks after last dose&#xD;
             of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participation in a clinical trial within 30 days before randomization; use of any&#xD;
             experimental oral therapy within 30 days or 5 half-lives prior to Day 1, whichever is&#xD;
             greater; or use of any biologic therapy within 12 weeks or 5 half-lives prior to Day&#xD;
             1, whichever is greater. Participants who have received an experimental therapy that&#xD;
             has no half-life, like a vaccine, should have completed that therapy at least 12 weeks&#xD;
             prior to Day 1. Participants who have received an experimental vaccine against a&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS) target, such as beta-amyloid or tau, are not eligible for&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any non-experimental vaccine within 2 weeks of randomization, until 2 weeks after the&#xD;
             last dose. It is advised that prospective participants receive their annual influenza&#xD;
             vaccine as early as possible in advance of the flu season, and then wait 2 weeks prior&#xD;
             to randomization. It is permitted to receive the annual influenza vaccine during the&#xD;
             screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Surgery or hospitalization during the 4 weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Planned procedure or surgery during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Systemically, clinically significantly immunocompromised patients, owing to continuing&#xD;
             effects of immune suppressing medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known history of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to&#xD;
             chimeric, human, or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Past history of seizures, with the exception of childhood febrile seizures.&#xD;
