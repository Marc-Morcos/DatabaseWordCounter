  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease and related diseases (ADRD) are a major public health issue. In France,&#xD;
      nearly 900,000 people have ADRD, which represents about 70% of dementia cases, and the&#xD;
      expected prevalence for 2020 is 1.2 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with ADRD have cognitive, behavioral and functional impairments that lead to&#xD;
      progressive impairment of quality of life and autonomy. Maintaining them at home depends&#xD;
      predominantly on their caregivers, mainly family, spouse or child. By definition, the&#xD;
      caregiver is &quot;the person who provides partial or total support to an elderly dependent person&#xD;
      or a person with a disability in the vicinity of the victim for the activities of daily&#xD;
      life&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investment of caregivers is therefore both human and financial, representing a greater or&#xD;
      lesser burden. This burden can significantly affect their quality of life. Indeed, studies&#xD;
      have shown that caregivers suffer from depletion, anxiety, depression and sleep disorders&#xD;
      resulting in a deterioration of their health, leading them to greater care consumption. They&#xD;
      would be more prone to cardiovascular diseases and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of the literature from 2009 examined 66 studies evaluating the contribution of&#xD;
      various technologies targeting demented patients and their caregivers. Of these, only 10&#xD;
      dealt with independence at home and the well-being of the patient and his / her caregiver.&#xD;
      The main limitations of these studies are the small samples (ranging from 1 to 6 patients),&#xD;
      the degree of cognitive degradation (mainly moderately severe) and the lack of standardized&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although new technologies promise powerful home-based solutions, studies evaluating their&#xD;
      efficacy for patients with ADRD and their caregivers remain scarce and fragile at the level&#xD;
      of evidence due to methodological biases.&#xD;

      Description of the intervention: Lili Smart solution consists of an application for&#xD;
      caregivers (web / mobile), a GSM watch worn by the patient, smart sensors placed at different&#xD;
      locations of the patient's home and a support service 24 / 24 and 7/7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The main objective is to evaluate the impact of the Lili Smart solution on the&#xD;
      burden felt by caregivers of patients with ADRD at 3 months and at 6 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of the Lili Smart solution at 3 months&#xD;
      and 6 months of follow-up on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The anxiety of the caregiver of the patient with ADRD;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression of the caregiver of the patient with ADRD;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The quality of life of the caregiver of the patient with ADRD;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The quality of life of the patient with ADRD,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The level of functional autonomy of the patient with ADRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The risks associated with the functional decline (falls, run aways) of the patient with&#xD;
           ADRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the social impact measurement, the study aims to demonstrate the&#xD;
      medico-economic impact of Lili smart solution as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The direct and indirect medical costs of the patient and the caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and caregiver adherence to the Lili Smart solution will also be assessed as a&#xD;
      secondary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology : This study is an interventional research on the human person meeting the&#xD;
      definition 1 Â° of article L1121-1 of the CSP and not relating to the products mentioned in&#xD;
      article L. 5311-1 It is a randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel-group,&#xD;
      interventional, randomized, controlled trial in N = 60 patients and their primary caregiver&#xD;
      with an observational phase (inactive device), and one interventional phase (activated&#xD;
      device).&#xD;
