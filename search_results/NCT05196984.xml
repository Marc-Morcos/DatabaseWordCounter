    <textblock>
      Down Syndrome (DS) is characterized by an additional copy of chromosome 21, which also&#xD;
      increases risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The investigators' lab found a non-invasive way&#xD;
      to remove toxic proteins from the brain in AD mouse models. Remarkably, treated mice also&#xD;
      have improved memory on behavioral testing. The investigators then translated this&#xD;
      non-invasive method, which uses light and sound to stimulate the brain, to be used in mild&#xD;
      Alzheimer's patients and cognitively normal adults. The investigators have also translated&#xD;
      this research into a vibrating speaker device to study tactile vibration to stimulate the&#xD;
      brain as well. For the present study, 30 participants with Down Syndrome and 30 cognitively&#xD;
      normal adult controls will be recruited, and the investigators will assess their brain waves&#xD;
      with electroencephalogram (EEG) during light, sound, and tactile stimulation. The&#xD;
      investigators will also test for safety, feasibility, and cognitive performance before and&#xD;
      after a 30-60 minute session of light and sound stimulation to optimize the stimulation&#xD;
      devices for use in the DS population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hallmark sign of Down Syndrome (DS) is an additional copy of chromosome 21, which is also&#xD;
      a risk factor of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Given the significantly increased likelihood of&#xD;
      developing AD in DS, it is imperative to study the impact of a possible disease modifying&#xD;
      therapeutic both in the prevention of progression to dementia as well as for changing the&#xD;
      course of memory disorders in this population. Development of a non-invasive medical device&#xD;
      that is effective in slowing cognitive impairment is not only revolutionary but also possibly&#xD;
      cost- effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information processing in the brain is thought to occur through synchronized neuronal&#xD;
      activity in the form of network oscillations. Disruptions of gamma oscillations, particularly&#xD;
      in the 30 - 50 Hz range, are reported as a potential early hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
      Using a non-invasive light (LED) flickering at 40 Hz, investigators were able to show&#xD;
      entrainment of 40 Hz gamma oscillations in the visual cortex of Alzheimer's mouse models,&#xD;
      along with microglia activation and a significant reduction in amyloid load. Similar gamma&#xD;
      activity disruptions have been observed in mouse models of Down Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In initial pilot studies, investigators found that the light and sound device is safe to use&#xD;
      in cognitively normal adults and adults with mild AD and that the stimulation at 40Hz can be&#xD;
      used to entrain their brain activity. Additionally, investigators have found that a vibrating&#xD;
      speaker tactile device is safe to use in cognitively normal adults and can also be used to&#xD;
      entrain brain activity. While trials are ongoing in the setting of sporadic Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease, the purpose of this proposed study is to determine whether gamma entrainment through&#xD;
      non-invasive 40Hz sensory stimulation can be observed in participants with Down Syndrome as&#xD;
      measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) and an acute stimulation session. The investigators&#xD;
      will recruit 30 participants diagnosed with Down Syndrome and 30 cognitively normal&#xD;
      participants as a comparison group. Participants will be randomly assigned into one of two&#xD;
      study conditions within their participant group: an active condition (40Hz stimulation) and a&#xD;
      control condition (sham stimulation) for a 30-60 minute light and sound stimulation session.&#xD;
      Cognitive and mental health evaluations as well as memory tests will be performed on all&#xD;
      participants, before and after exposure to the GENUS light and sound device for 30-60&#xD;
      minutes, which can deliver light and sound waves at different frequencies. The GENUS device&#xD;
      is composed of a panel with light-emitting diode (LED) illumination and speakers for auditory&#xD;
      stimulation. In addition to the stimulation session, the investigators will also use&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) to check how the participant's brain waves respond to the&#xD;
      stimulation, and use questionnaires to evaluate for safety and tolerability. The&#xD;
      investigators will also use EEG to check how a subset of the participants (10 total&#xD;
      individuals) respond to tactile stimulation using a vibrating speaker device. The tactile&#xD;
      stimulation will simply be an additional condition during the EEG for these 10 individuals,&#xD;
      but will not impact the stimulation session or study condition assignments, which involve&#xD;
      only light and sound. This study will provide critical insight into potential longitudinal&#xD;
      studies involving non-invasive 40Hz sensory stimulation in subjects with Down Syndrome as a&#xD;
      potential intervention for the development of AD.&#xD;
