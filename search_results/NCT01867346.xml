      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is a long-term study of human aging. To&#xD;
      see how the brain changes with age, researchers will study BLSA participants who are at least&#xD;
      60 years old. In particular, researchers are looking for early markers of possible&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and other conditions that cause memory loss. To do so, they will give&#xD;
      tests of memory and brain function, and stay in close contact with participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study cognitive changes that occur in normal aging and in people who develop memory&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 60 years of age who are participating in the BLSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are three parts to this study. These study procedures will be done under the usual&#xD;
           BLSA guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take paper and pencil tests. The tests measure skills such as&#xD;
           language, attention, memory, and problem solving. They will also ask questions about&#xD;
           emotions and feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will give the name and phone number of a person who knows them well and&#xD;
           sees them often. Researchers will ask this person to fill out questionnaires on the&#xD;
           effects of aging on the participant. These questions will monitor the participant's&#xD;
           memory and ability to function independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular phone calls between study visits. These calls will help&#xD;
           to keep their information up to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will continue on this study for as long as they are able to participate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the early 1960 s cognitive testing has been performed in conjunction with BLSA visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the mid-1980 s, the primary focus of these investigations was the natural history of&#xD;
      age associated changes in memory and other cognitive functions. While a portion of the work&#xD;
      of the Cognition Section still involves descriptive studies of cross-sectional and&#xD;
      longitudinal effects of age on specific cognitive abilities, the cognitive testing program&#xD;
      was refocused in the mid-1980 s to investigate early predictors of cognitive change,&#xD;
      including risk and protective factors for cognitive impairment and Alzheimer s disease. In&#xD;
      collaboration with Dr. Claudia Kawas, and more recently Dr. Richard O Brien of the Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins Department of Neurology, the research program of the Cognition Section was expanded&#xD;
      to ascertain incident cases of cognitive impairment and dementia, including home visit&#xD;
      assessments for inactive participants. In addition, an autopsy program in collaboration with&#xD;
      the Alzheimer s Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Johns Hopkins University was initiated.&#xD;
      This collaboration has yielded a number of important findings including information on the&#xD;
      incidence of Alzheimer s disease, and demonstrations that use of hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
      in postmenopausal women and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in older adults6&#xD;
      are associated with reductions in the risk for Alzheimer s disease in our community-dwelling&#xD;
      BLSA participant sample.&#xD;
