    <textblock>
      The increasing incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders with the change in&#xD;
      the world age demographic is a source of major public health concern. Early and accurate&#xD;
      identification of individuals at high risk of Alzheimer's Disease has become a priority. Over&#xD;
      the last years, research has focused on the concept of &quot;Mild Cognitive Impairment&quot; which&#xD;
      happens to be a heterogeneous condition as, depending on the studies, Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment patients' conversion rates to dementia range from 2 to 15 percent per year. A&#xD;
      study of the full range of stages of evolution, from preclinical stage, to clinical&#xD;
      expression of dementia or death is therefore of utmost importance to improve our knowledge on&#xD;
      AD and trigger the development of new treatments, especially if between stages transition can&#xD;
      be related to neuroimaging (either structural or molecular), biological (Cerebro-Spinal&#xD;
      Fluid, serum or plasma) or vascular damages markers. However, if all the above markers have&#xD;
      been shown to be individually associated with worsening of cognitive status, no prior study&#xD;
      has simultaneously explored the association of a large panel of risk factors and biomarkers&#xD;
      with the progression through early signs of cognitive impairment until AD in a large sample&#xD;
      of study participants. In parallel to improving the knowledge on AD, it is also important to&#xD;
      better estimate the social and economic burden of AD and their consequences on the&#xD;
      individuals and their circle and how they evolve from early phase (pre-clinical) of the&#xD;
      disease to the most severe stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort, solution to the item 29 of the Plan Alzheimer 2008-2012, has been developed&#xD;
      according to the initial memorandum of understanding prepared by the &quot;Comit√© Plan Cohortes&quot;&#xD;
      of the Fondation Plan Alzheimer, and taking on board comments provided by the Scientific&#xD;
      Advisory Board (July 2010) of the Fondation Plan Alzheimer and the whole working groups&#xD;
      constituted for the preparation of the pilot phase: clinicians, neuro-imaging specialists,&#xD;
      biologists, social sciences researchers (from June 2010). The cohort is built to fulfil the&#xD;
      guiding principles as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It should be scientifically original and identify hypothesis-driven research, allowing a&#xD;
           corpus of new or confirmatory knowledge of a high-level of evidence to be acquired. In&#xD;
           addition, the infrastructure (standardised collection of socio-demographic, clinical,&#xD;
           imaging, biological data) may allow to respond, in a timely manner, to additional&#xD;
           questions that may emerge over time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An interdisciplinary approach is set up as the condition of individuals affected by&#xD;
           neurodegenerative dementias involves clinical and biological aspects but also&#xD;
           environmental, social and economic components;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While pursuing its own original scientific objectives, the cohort should have the&#xD;
           potential for a comparison with other equivalent cohorts around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort will be including individuals at high risk of developing a neurodegenerative&#xD;
      dementia. As such, the cohort is aiming at providing results with an expected impact for&#xD;
      those individuals of the same profile, as well as their caregivers and their case management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One expected impact is to increase knowledge on the progression from early signs of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment to AD and estimate associations between these signs and level of biomarkers&#xD;
      assessed through imaging or blood or CSF samples. Another major expected impact is to&#xD;
      standardise and harmonise protocols in terms of clinical and neuro-psychological&#xD;
      examinations, biological markers, neuroimaging markers, diagnosis of dementia, support to&#xD;
      caregivers and informants.&#xD;
