  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficulty completing everyday tasks is a primary reason for the high cost of care, loss of&#xD;
      caregiver paid hours, and general caregiver burden associated with dementia. Electronic&#xD;
      reminder applications hold promise as a low-cost solution to improve daily functioning,&#xD;
      promote aging in place, and reduce caregiver burden and cost of care, particularly as older&#xD;
      adults become more computer literate. There are many electronic reminders available for&#xD;
      healthy individuals, but few have been developed to target the specific cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties that impede completion of everyday tasks in people with dementia (i.e.,&#xD;
      premature decay of task goals, decreased motivation to perform tasks, distractibility,&#xD;
      semantic knowledge degradation, etc.). Furthermore, there is a dearth of feasibility research&#xD;
      on the fundamental efficacy and usability of reminder applications for people with dementia.&#xD;
      This R21 proposal addresses these gaps with a feasibility study of the SmartPrompt, an&#xD;
      enhanced electronic reminder aid designed for people with dementia that is used with an&#xD;
      inexpensive smartphone. A diverse sample of older adults with mild dementia (N = 40) and&#xD;
      their caregivers (N =40) will be trained to use the SmartPrompt and then asked to use the&#xD;
      application to perform a target task (hydration, meals, or medication) twice per day in their&#xD;
      homes for two weeks. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the SmartPrompt is effective at&#xD;
      promoting everyday task completion (i.e., efficacy) relative to a one- week control period&#xD;
      without the SmartPrompt. Using a single-group crossover design, efficacy outcomes will be&#xD;
      obtained during the SmartPrompt and Control Conditions and will include participant and&#xD;
      caregiver reports of task completion, caregiver report of burden, and participant report of&#xD;
      frustration Aim 2 will investigate whether the SmartPrompt will be perceived favorably by&#xD;
      participants and caregivers and the extent to which technical support is needed for its use&#xD;
      (i.e., usability). Usability measures will be obtained from caregivers (report of technical&#xD;
      problems, questionnaire), participants (questionnaire), the study team (training time,&#xD;
      technical support required), and the smartphone (i.e., measures of smartphone use, response&#xD;
      times to prompts). A third exploratory aim is to examine participant and caregiver features&#xD;
      that are associated with efficacy and usability outcomes, including participant cognitive&#xD;
      profile, participant/caregiver demographics, computer proficiency and self-efficacy, desire&#xD;
      to change, etc. Results will be used to inform 1) a working model of barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators for the use and efficacy of prompting applications that may be tested in future&#xD;
      studies and 2) SmartPrompt design modifications for a future Phase II clinical trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The exorbitant health care costs associated with dementia relative to other illnesses are a&#xD;
      signiÔ¨Åcant concern in the US and other countries with aging populations. Difficulty&#xD;
      completing everyday tasks is a primary reason for the high cost of care, loss of caregiver&#xD;
      paid hours, and general caregiver burden. As older adults become more computer literate,&#xD;
      assistive technologies hold promise as an inexpensive solution to improve daily functioning&#xD;
      and ultimately promote aging in place, reduce caregiver burden, and reduce healthcare&#xD;
      expenditures due to secondary health issues that arise when everyday tasks are neglected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic reminder applications are a type of assistive technology that deliver cues to&#xD;
      perform important daily activities (e.g., take medication). Electronic reminders are widely&#xD;
      available, but, few of these applications have been designed specifically to 1) target the&#xD;
      numerous cognitive difficulties that impede the recall and completion of everyday tasks in&#xD;
      people with dementia (i.e., premature decay of task goals, decreased motivation to perform&#xD;
      tasks, etc.); 2) circumvent the sensory/motor difficulties that older adults face when using&#xD;
      technology (i.e., simple, user-friendly interface); and 3) be accessible at a low cost (i.e.,&#xD;
      easily integrated with consumer devices like smartphones). Additionally, there is a dearth of&#xD;
      fundamental knowledge and quantitative data on the feasibility of electronic reminder&#xD;
      applications for older adults with dementia. This revised R21 application&#xD;
      (PAR-15-351/PAR-18-179) proposes a Stage I feasibility study that will address gaps in&#xD;
      fundamental knowledge on the efficacy and usability of an electronic reminder aid for&#xD;
      commercially available smartphones specifically designed for people with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 (efficacy): To investigate the hypothesis that a reminder application designed to&#xD;
      target the specific cognitive impairments that preclude task completion in dementia and to&#xD;
      circumvent sensory/motor challenges faced by many older adults (SmartPrompt) is efficacious&#xD;
      for promoting everyday task completion. The SmartPrompt includes six features to address&#xD;
      cognitive impairments that cause task failure in dementia: 1) reminder alert (prospective&#xD;
      memory impairment); 2) choice to respond to reminder immediately or at a later time&#xD;
      (distractibility); 3) instructions (semantic knowledge degradation); 4) persistent reminder&#xD;
      until task is completed (poor monitoring); 5) activity logging via photos (episodic memory&#xD;
      impairment); 6) gaming rewards for task completion (apathy). Diverse participants with mild&#xD;
      dementia (N = 40) and their caregivers will be asked to track performance of a target task&#xD;
      (medication, meals, or hydration) twice per day for two weeks. Using an AB/BA crossover&#xD;
      design, participants will use the SmartPrompt for one of the two weeks (SmartPrompt&#xD;
      Condition) and will perform the task as usual during the other week (Control condition; order&#xD;
      counterbalanced across participants). Efficacy outcomes, including caregiver/participant&#xD;
      daily logs of task completion and reports of caregiver burden and participant frustration,&#xD;
      will be examined using repeated-measures analyses comparing the Control vs. SmartPrompt&#xD;
      Conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (usability)- To evaluate the usability of the SmartPrompt using measures obtained from&#xD;
      caregivers, participants with dementia, the study team, and the study smartphone. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that the design features of the SmartPrompt will be perceived favorably&#xD;
      by participants and will require minimal technical support from the study team and caregivers&#xD;
      during the one-week SmartPrompt testing period. The investigators also expect that the&#xD;
      structure and support embedded in the SmartPrompt application design will lead to favorable&#xD;
      caregiver and participant usability ratings relative to published standards. All technical&#xD;
      problems reported by the participant and/or caregiver will be logged and analyzed by the&#xD;
      study team for future design modifications. Metrics obtained directly from the smartphone&#xD;
      (e.g., response times to reminder alarms) also will be evaluated as objective measures of&#xD;
      usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: To examine participant and caregiver features that are associated with&#xD;
      SmartPrompt efficacy/usability. Features of primary interest include participant sex, level&#xD;
      of education, level and type of cognitive/functional impairment, caregiver and participant&#xD;
      computer literacy/self-efficacy, and desire to change. The investigators will recruit a&#xD;
      diverse older adult sample and administer measures of cognition, performance-based testing of&#xD;
      everyday function, and questionnaires on mood/anxiety, computer&#xD;
      literacy/proficiency/self-efficacy, and desire for behavior change. Bivariate correlations&#xD;
      and multiple regression analyses will be performed with participant/caregiver features as&#xD;
      predictors and efficacy/usability outcomes as the dependent variables. Results of this aim&#xD;
      will be used to 1) develop a working framework of barriers and facilitators for the efficacy&#xD;
      and usability of electronic reminder applications that will be tested in future studies and&#xD;
      2) inform modifications of the SmartPrompt training protocol and/or design for a future Phase&#xD;
      II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the limited success of pharmaceutical treatments for dementia, there has been&#xD;
      surprisingly little rigorous research on the potential to leverage relatively simple&#xD;
      assistive technologies to improve daily functioning for people with dementia. Even relatively&#xD;
      modest improvements in daily function could have a host of positive downstream effects,&#xD;
      including increased autonomy and quality of life and improved health for people with dementia&#xD;
      and reduced cost of care and reduced burden for caregivers.&#xD;
