        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women of non-childbearing potential and men, aged 50 to 85 years, inclusive, with a&#xD;
             diagnosis of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease according to the 2018 NIA-AA&#xD;
             criteria and at least a 6-month history of decline in cognitive function documented in&#xD;
             the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i) Non-childbearing potential for women is defined as postmenopausal (last menses&#xD;
             greater than 24 months) or undergone a documented bilateral tubal ligation or&#xD;
             hysterectomy. If last menses less than 24 months, a serum follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
             (FSH) value confirming post-menopausal status may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii) Male participants who are sexually active with a woman of child-bearing potential&#xD;
             must agree to use condoms during the study and for 3 months after last dose. Female&#xD;
             partners should also consider using an acceptable means of birth control, though it is&#xD;
             not mandatory. Acceptable forms of birth control include abstinence, birth control&#xD;
             pills, or any double combination of: intrauterine device (IUD), male or female condom,&#xD;
             diaphragm, sponge, and cervical cap.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. CSF positive for amyloid beta (as defined in the study manual). Historical CSF results&#xD;

             however, an LP is still required as part of screening procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Neuroimaging (MRI) consistent with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and&#xD;
             without findings of significant exclusionary abnormalities (see Section 9.3 exclusion&#xD;
             criteria no. 4). An historical MRI, up to 1 year prior to screening, may be used as&#xD;
             long as there have been no interval clinical neurologic events that may suggest a&#xD;
             change in the MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. MMSE 18-26 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;

             Principal Investigator, has contact with the study participant for a sufficient number&#xD;
             of hours per week to provide informative responses on the protocol assessments,&#xD;
             oversee the administration of study drug, and is willing and able to participate in&#xD;
             all study site visits and some study assessments. The caregiver/ study partner must&#xD;
             provide written informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
