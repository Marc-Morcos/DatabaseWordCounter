  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Masitinib is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets activated cells of&#xD;
      the neuroimmune system (mast cells and microglia). Study AB21004 will evaluate masitinib as&#xD;
      an adjunct to cholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine in patients with mild-to-moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Masitinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has demonstrated neuroprotective action&#xD;
      in neurodegenerative diseases via inhibition of mast cell and microglia/macrophage activity,&#xD;
      and which is capable of accumulating within the central nervous system (CNS) at a&#xD;
      therapeutically relevant concentration. There is a growing body of evidence implicating mast&#xD;
      cells and microglia (types of innate immune cells that are present in the CNS), with the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masitinib has been shown to restore normal spatial learning performance and promote recovery&#xD;
      of synaptic markers in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, with its synapto-protective&#xD;
      action being directly linked to mast cell inhibition. The potential benefit of masitinib in&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease has been previously&#xD;
      demonstrated in a phase 2 study (AB04024; NCT00976118) and a positive phase 2B/3 study&#xD;
      (AB09004; NCT01872598) that showed masitinib (4.5 mg/kg/day) was associated with a&#xD;
      statistically significant slowing of cognitive deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of study AB21004 is to confirm treatment effect with masitinib as an adjunct to&#xD;
      cholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
