      The investigators will compare PI-2620 tau PET scans from patients with frontotemporal lobar&#xD;
      degeneration (FTLD), patients with non-amnestic presentations of Alzheimer's disease (naAD),&#xD;
      and demographically matched cognitively normal seniors.&#xD;

      The current study is a companion imaging study to IRB# 842873, &quot;University of Pennsylvania&#xD;
      Centralized Observational Research Repository on Neurodegenerative Disease&quot; (UNICORN).&#xD;
      UNICORN is an observational study that aims to collect and store cross-sectional and&#xD;
      longitudinal data from brain imaging, clinical and neuropsychological assessment, biomarker&#xD;
      assays, and genetic testing of participants to improve clinical assessment and basic&#xD;
      scientific understanding of multiple neurodegenerative conditions. The UNICORN cohort&#xD;
      includes neurodegenerative disease patients who have been evaluated by trained neurologists&#xD;
      in the Penn Cognitive Neurology Clinic according to published clinical research diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria and reviewed at a weekly multidisciplinary consensus conference; as well as&#xD;
      individuals with normal cognition recruited from the general community or from among&#xD;
      caregivers/relatives of patients participating in research. As part of the UNICORN study,&#xD;
      participants are asked to undergo periodic (typically annual) magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) and clinical/neuropsychological assessment. Participants may also be asked to undergo&#xD;
      genetic testing to detect known variants associated with increased neurodegenerative disease&#xD;
      risk. UNICORN participants are also asked to undergo a one-time lumbar puncture to assess&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid protein levels, including amyloid-ß1-42, an established biomarker for&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologic change. As an alternative method of assessing&#xD;
      amyloid status, some UNICORN participants may elect to undergo an [18F] florbetaben amyloid&#xD;
      PET scan under protocol #824869.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in the current study must be concurrently enrolled in UNICORN. The current&#xD;
      study comprises a recruitment/screening visit and a single PET imaging scan using the PI-2620&#xD;
      tracer. The central hypotheses are 1) that PI-2620 PET will distinguish Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (AD) or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) tauopathy from the brains of both healthy&#xD;
      seniors and patients with FTLD due to accumulation of transactive response DNA binding&#xD;
      protein 43 kDA (TDP-43); and 2) that in FTLD and AD tauopathies, PI-2620 will be associated&#xD;
      with patients' current and future cognitive, motor, and functional impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened according to the study selection criteria, based on&#xD;
      self-report, information provided by caregivers, and medical history available through&#xD;
      PennChart or through the Integrative Neurodegenerative Disease Database (INDD). During the&#xD;
      recruitment/screening visit, participants will provide written informed consent for this&#xD;
      protocol before beginning any study procedures. Participants must satisfy all eligibility&#xD;
      criteria and consent to PI-2620 PET imaging to be enrolled in the study. Participants will be&#xD;
      assigned to one of 6 groups, including cognitively and neurologically normal seniors (CN;&#xD;
      planned enrollment of n=12), non-amnestic AD (naAD, n=12), frontotemporal lobar degeneration&#xD;
      (FTLD) due to tauopathy (FTLD-tau, n=12), FTLD due to TDP-43 (n=12), FTLD-tau due to a known&#xD;
      genetic mutation in the MAPT gene (genetic FTLD-tau, n=3), and FTLD-TDP due to a known&#xD;
      mutation in the GRN gene or open reading frame 72 of chromosome 9 (C9orf72) (genetic&#xD;
      FTLD-TDP, n=3). Total planned enrollment is thus 54 participants; recruitment and data&#xD;
      acquisition for the study are projected to take approximately 3 years.&#xD;
