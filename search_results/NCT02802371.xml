  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caring for patients with Alzheimer Disease or Related Disorders (ADRD) is accompanied with a&#xD;
      caregiver burden that increases with the progression of the disease. This burden can have&#xD;
      physical, psychological, emotional, social and financial issue on the informal caregivers who&#xD;
      are often represented as hidden secondary patients. They frequently have a higher risk of&#xD;
      developing mood disorders as depression, anxiety, stress, sleep disorders and a lower quality&#xD;
      of life associated with a greater use of psychotropic drugs. They also incur higher risk of&#xD;
      heart disease and mortality. The embrittlement of the caregiver is a major factor of early&#xD;
      institutionalization of patient. In the PIXEL study, the mean age of the men caregivers was&#xD;
      73.9 years and 64.8 for the women caregivers. Elderly themselves, especially spouses, the&#xD;
      informal caregivers are also exposed to common chronic diseases and associated polypharmacy&#xD;
      with a higher risk of developing drug-related problems due to aging and negligence of their&#xD;
      own health care. These risks are increased mainly in the elderly because of changes in&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters related to aging, acute or chronic diseases&#xD;
      and the potentially inappropriate prescription (PIP). Previous studies have shown the&#xD;
      effectiveness and positive impact of optimization of the therapeutics by a clinical&#xD;
      pharmacist on the reduction of drug-related problems, length of hospital stay, readmission&#xD;
      rates, quality of life and mortality. The patient's medication management is usually&#xD;
      delegated to the informal caregiver, who must also manage his own treatment. The caregiver&#xD;
      may face difficulties with therapeutics (e.g., inappropriate dosage form, adverse effects and&#xD;
      patient refusal) that could impact on its compliance with treatment or that of his relative.&#xD;
      No previous study has evaluated the impact of pharmaceutical collaborative care including&#xD;
      personalized interview with a clinical pharmacist and optimization of drug prescribing among&#xD;
      patients with ADRD and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, many studies have assessed the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions on&#xD;
      caregiver burden, mood disorders and the patient institutionalization. Meta-analysis showed a&#xD;
      moderate improvement of the caregiver burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the PHARMAID study is to measure the impact of personalized&#xD;
      pharmaceutical collaborative care integrated to a multidisciplinary psychosocial program on&#xD;
      the burden of ADRD caregivers and assessed at 18-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>The caregiver burden is measured using the Zarit Burden Index (ZBI) questionnaire. The ZBI is a subjective measure of burden that includes 22 items exploring the caregiver's perception and feelings about care situations. Each item was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always), which are summed. The score range is 0-88, a higher score indicating a higher burden level.</description>
