  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 60% of care partners of persons with AD/ADRD report feeling lonely. Building on the&#xD;
      existing evidence that increasing meaning and purpose in life is a strong predictor of&#xD;
      decreased loneliness, interventions to reduce loneliness in this population may be&#xD;
      strengthened by incorporating concepts from Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy (MCP). Thus, the&#xD;
      overall goal of the proposed project is to reduce loneliness in care partners of patients&#xD;
      with AD/ADRD through increasing their sense of meaning and purpose in life using concepts&#xD;
      from MCP, delivered via a web-based platform, RELOAD-C (REducing LOneliness in Alzeheimer's&#xD;
      Disease-Care Partners). This will be achieved through three Specific Aims. Aim 1 consists of&#xD;
      three phases (preparatory work, stakeholder involvement with N=15 AD/ADRD care partners, and&#xD;
      adaptation of the existing web-based platform) to produce RELOAD-C, which centralizes: 1) 6&#xD;
      brief videos portraying an MCP expert delivering MCP concepts; 2) links to 7 virtual group&#xD;
      meetings (6 weekly + 1 booster) to discuss MCP concepts (of note, the support groups utilized&#xD;
      in this study exist only as part of this research); and 3) written content expanding on the&#xD;
      material from the MCP videos. Aim 2 evaluates usability/acceptability of RELOAD-C (defined as&#xD;
      a task success rate ≥ 78%, and scores ≥ 68 on the System Usability Scale) with N=20 care&#xD;
      partners of persons with AD/ADRD. Aim 3 proposes a pilot RCT to evaluate the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the RELOAD-C components (MCP videos vs. MCP-focused group discussions) in&#xD;
      reducing loneliness and feasibility of conducting a future, large-scale RCT. N=96 AD/ADRD&#xD;
      care partners will be randomized to: usual care, n=32; MCP videos alone via RELOAD-C, n=32;&#xD;
      or MCP videos + weekly groups via RELOAD-C, n=32. Care partners' outcomes will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, and 6-weeks and 3-months post-baseline. The investigators expect the effect sizes&#xD;
      will be in the moderate range (.3). Feasibility is defined as: ≥ 75% consented, ≤ 30%&#xD;
      drop-out, and 80% engagement with intervention. Reducing loneliness among care partners is of&#xD;
      high public health significance and incorporating MCP in loneliness interventions is highly&#xD;
      innovative. In sum, the investigators will enroll 15 care partners during Aim 1, 20 care&#xD;
      partners during Aim 2, and 96 care partners during Aim 3.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Loneliness is common in care partners of persons with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD-related&#xD;
      dementias (ADRD). In the United States, more than 6 million people have AD/ADRD. This number&#xD;
      is expected to reach 13 million by 2050, increasing the number of care partners&#xD;
      proportionately. More than 60% of care partners of persons with AD/ADRD are lonely, defined&#xD;
      as the distressing experience when one's relationships are poorer in quantity and quality&#xD;
      than desired. This is not surprising given the unique experience of caring for a person with&#xD;
      AD/ADRD, characterized by declines in intellectually stimulating conversation, loss of mutual&#xD;
      support, and avoidance of social outings. Already elevated, care partners' loneliness is&#xD;
      among the problems exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Loneliness is associated with a 26%&#xD;
      increased risk of mortality, and physical and mental morbidity. In longitudinal studies,&#xD;
      loneliness significantly predicts heart attack, diabetes, depression, anxiety, and distress.&#xD;
      Studies of care partners show that loneliness is associated with poorer quality of&#xD;
      relationships, and burden, as well as negative patient outcomes. Therefore, there is an&#xD;
      urgent need for effective evidence-based interventions to reduce loneliness in care partners&#xD;
      of persons with AD/ADRD. Existing interventions for care partners of persons with AD/ADRD&#xD;
      demonstrate limited efficacy in reducing loneliness. Existing interventions focus on&#xD;
      providing education, decision support, skills training, and stress management. In all these&#xD;
      cases, the intervention did not significantly reduce loneliness at follow-up. Existing&#xD;
      interventions have not attempted to reduce loneliness through increasing care partners' sense&#xD;
      of meaning and purpose in life, despite strong evidence that increased meaning in life&#xD;
      predicts reduced loneliness. A qualitative analysis of 119 loneliness interventions&#xD;
      demonstrated that their limited efficacy is due to a lack of content focused on meaning in&#xD;
      life. Several empirical studies indicate a strong, inverse relationship between meaning and&#xD;
      loneliness. Macia et al. 2021 found that meaning in life was the most important predictor of&#xD;
      loneliness, and the authors recommend targeting meaning in life in future interventions.&#xD;
      Folker et al. 2021 theorize that meaning in life promotes a better ability to cope with&#xD;
      loneliness. Interventions to reduce loneliness in AD/ADRD care partners may be strengthened&#xD;
      by incorporating concepts from Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy (MCP). MCP focuses on exploring&#xD;
      sources of meaning in life and is based on the premise that finding meaning and purpose in&#xD;
      one's existence is a primary force of motivation. Examination into the mechanism of change in&#xD;
      MCP demonstrated significant mediation effects via a sense of meaning and purpose in life on&#xD;
      outcomes of improved quality of life, and decreased depression, hopelessness and desire for&#xD;
      hastened death. Yet, the impact of MCP on loneliness has not yet been systematically&#xD;
      evaluated. MCP, originally found to increase a sense of meaning and purpose in life in&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer, has since been adapted for many populations, including care&#xD;
      partners. The MCP adaptation for care partners was led by Dr. Allison Applebaum&#xD;
      (consultant),and focuses on finding meaning and purpose in life through one's role as a care&#xD;
      partner, regardless of the illness the care recipient has. Dr. Applebaum found MCP to be&#xD;
      efficacious in increasing meaning and purpose in life in cancer care partners when delivered&#xD;
      via brief videos. Therefore, the overall goal of the proposed project is to reduce AD/ADRD&#xD;
      care partners' loneliness through increasing their meaning and purpose in life using concepts&#xD;
      from MCP. The investigators expect that reducing loneliness will reduce care partners'&#xD;
      negative outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, distress, and burden. These MCP concepts will&#xD;
      be delivered via RELOAD-C (REducing LOneliness in Alzeheimer's Disease-Care Partners), a&#xD;
      web-based platform that centralizes 6 brief videos of an MCP expert (Dr. Applebaum)&#xD;
      discussing sources of meaning, links to virtual group meetings facilitated by a social worker&#xD;
      trained in MCP to promote discussion of MCP concepts, and written content providing guidance&#xD;
      on homework and exercises referenced in the MCP videos. The investigators currently do not&#xD;
      know the effect of MCP videos on increasing meaning and purpose in life in AD/ADRD care&#xD;
      partners, though they expect these videos to be efficacious as they were with cancer care&#xD;
      partners. It remains unclear whether watching these MCP videos, which lacks bi-directional&#xD;
      interaction, is sufficient to also reduce loneliness in care partners of persons with&#xD;
      AD/ADRD. Interventions that show promise in reducing loneliness in care partners of persons&#xD;
      with AD/ADRD, based on evaluations in small samples, are those that focus on increasing&#xD;
      opportunities for communication through group meetings. Building off the strengths of the&#xD;
      existing literature, then, the investigators expect that adding virtual group meetings&#xD;
      focused on discussion of MCP concepts will produce a comparatively larger reduction in&#xD;
      loneliness than watching MCP videos alone. Thus, to advance the field, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to preliminarily evaluate the strength of&#xD;
      each RELOAD-C component (MCP videos, MCP virtual weekly group discussions) on care partners'&#xD;
      loneliness. The software platform that the investigators will be adapting to produce RELOAD-C&#xD;
      was developed by Dr. Michael Diefenbach (primary mentor) to deliver intervention content&#xD;
      through videos and interactive features to bladder cancer patients and their care partners.&#xD;
      Care partners of persons with AD/ADRD experience barriers to participating in in-person&#xD;
      interventions, including unique concerns (e.g. they cannot leave the patient alone). Thus,&#xD;
      delivering intervention content via a web-based platform maximizes reach whilst obtaining&#xD;
      comparable clinical effectiveness as traditional in-person interventions. Overview of the&#xD;
      research design. Aim 1a: Preparatory Work: the study team will modify the script from Dr.&#xD;
      Applebaum's videos of MCP for cancer care partners to ensure the language is suitable for&#xD;
      AD/ADRD care partners (i.e. remove references to cancer and cancer-specific challenges), Aim&#xD;
      1b: Stakeholder Involvement: The study team will circulate these scripts/drafts created in&#xD;
      Aim 1a to N=15 care partners of persons with AD/ADRD to obtain feedback. This will occur in&#xD;
      two rounds, the first of which is dedicated to obtaining feedback and the second of which is&#xD;
      dedicated to soliciting final comments after the feedback from the first round has been&#xD;
      integrated. Aim 1c: Adaptation of an existing web-based delivery platform: Michael Diefenbach&#xD;
      (primary mentor) developed a web-based platform to deliver and reinforce intervention content&#xD;
      to patients with bladder cancer. The study team will adapt this existing platform by&#xD;
      replacing the bladder cancer content with MCP content prepared and revised during Aims 1a-1b,&#xD;
      producing RELOAD-C. Aim 2: Usability and Acceptability Testing Phase of RELOAD-C will be&#xD;
      achieved through a mixed-methods design and the Think Aloud method a direct observation&#xD;
      method of user testing that involves asking users to think out loud as they are performing a&#xD;
      task, with N=20 AD/ADRD care partners. Aim 3: Pilot RCT: Using a modified cluster RCT design&#xD;
      with two-step randomization, N=96 care partners will be randomized to usual care (n=32), MCP&#xD;
      videos delivered via RELOAD-C (n=32), or MCP videos plus virtual group meetings delivered via&#xD;
      RELOAD-C (n=32). Care partner outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and 6-weeks and 3-months&#xD;
      post-baseline.&#xD;

The first 6 group meetings will occur weekly, during the first 6 weeks after participants are randomized in step 2. Each of the first 6 group meetings will facilitate discussion of the MCP concepts introduced in that week's video, as participants receive access to each video ~3 days prior to the group meeting. The 7th virtual meeting will be used as a &quot;booster&quot; in week 9 after step 2 randomization, and will focus on sharing how participants are using the MCP concepts in their daily lives. All meetings will be facilitated by our social worker, Katherine Henthorne, LCSW.</description>
