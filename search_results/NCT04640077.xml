    <measure>Part A: Correlation between VTC and on-site assessment for PAIR 1 for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between VTC and on-site assessment for PAIR 1 (defined as completing a VTC evaluation and one in person evaluation regardless of order) for the ADAS-Cog13. The ADAS-Cog13 (13-item version of ADAS Cog) assesses areas of cognitive function that are the most typically impaired in AD: orientation, verbal memory, language, praxis, delayed free recall, digit cancellation, and maze-completion measures. The ADAS-Cog13 scale ranges from 0 to 85, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part A: Correlation between VTC and on-site assessment for PAIR 1 for Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between VTC and on-site assessment for PAIR 1 for ADCS-ADL. The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item inventory developed as a rater-administered questionnaire answered by the participant's caregiver. The ADCS-ADL measures both basic and instrumental activities of daily living by participants. The range for the total ADCS-ADL score is 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating greater level of impairment. Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-iADL) is calculated from a subset of questions from the ADCS-ADL. The range for the ADCS-iADL is 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance.</description>

    <measure>Part A: Correlation between VTC and on-site assessment for PAIR 1 for Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between VTC and on-site assessment for PAIR 1 for MMSE. The MMSE is a brief instrument used to assess cognitive function in participants. The range for the total MMSE score is 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater level of impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part A: Correlation between VTC and on-site assessment for PAIR 1 for Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between VTC and on-site assessment for PAIR 1 for CDR-SB. The CDR-SB is a global assessment tool than can be used to effectively evaluate both cognition and function. The CDR-SB scores are calculated by adding the box scores and range from 0 to 18 (with higher scores indicative of more impairment).</description>

    <measure>Part B: Change from Baseline on the ADAS-Cog13 score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline on the ADAS-Cog13. The ADAS-Cog13 (13-item version of ADAS Cog) assesses areas of cognitive function that are the most typically impaired in AD: orientation, verbal memory, language, praxis, delayed free recall, digit cancellation, and maze-completion measures.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part B: Change from Baseline on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline on the iADRS. The iADRS is a composite that measures both cognition and function from the ADAS- Cog and the ADCS-iADL. The iADRS is calculated as a linear combination of the total scores of the ADAS-Cog13 (score range 0 to 85 with higher scores reflecting worse performance) and the ADCS-iADL (score range from 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance). The iADRS score ranges from 0 to 144 with lower scores indicating greater impairment.</description>
