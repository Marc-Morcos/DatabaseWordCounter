  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled and parallel trial&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BAC in patients with Alzheimer's disease or vascular&#xD;
      dementia. The investigation product, BAC, is a potential anti-inflammatory agent consisted of&#xD;
      Multi-Glycan Complex (MGC) from the Soybean extract. It aims to reduce the neruoinflammation&#xD;
      in the Alzhemimer's disease and vascular dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either one of topical application of&#xD;
      BAC or BAC matched vehicle, topical application on external nasal skin, scalp, and neck,&#xD;
      30mL/day, 2 times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment duration for each patient is 12 weeks, which consists of 6 visits located at&#xD;
      Screening, Baseline (Week 0), Weeks -2, -4, -8, and -12. During the treatment period,&#xD;
      patients may continue to receive routinely used medications or treatments for Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease or vascular dementia except those prohibited under this protocol.&#xD;

    <description>This is a global measure of detectable change in cognition, function and behavior.</description>

    <measure>Change in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score at all post treatment visits compared to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>An inventory of informant based items to assess activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, i.e. functional performance, of Alzheimer's disease (AD).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at all post treatment visits compared to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>This is a multi-item instrument that examines orientation, registration, attention, calculation, recall, visuospatial abilities and language. The score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. MMSE was measured at Screening, Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score at all post treatment visits compared to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI is the behavior instrument most widely used in clinical trials of anti-dementia agents. The NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time, examining and scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses to screening questions. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined. Information for the NPI is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the patient's behavior. The NPI assesses 12 behavioral domains (12-item NPI) common in dementia. Each NPI domain is scored by the caregiver based on a standardized interview administered by the clinician. NPI-12 Caregiver Distress score is scored for associated caregiver distress from 0 (no distress) to 5 (very severe or extreme). Higher scores indicate greater distress. NPI was measured at Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse event incidence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a study medication and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study medication, whether or not related to the study medication. Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs unless determined to be clinically significant by the Investigator. The number of participants with adverse events within the BAC and placebo groups was determined.</description>

    <measure>Change in physical examination results</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>Items include general appearance, skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, head and neck, heart, joints, chest and lungs, abdomen, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal, nervous system, and others.</description>
