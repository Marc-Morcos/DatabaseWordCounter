  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this open-label extension study is to assess long-term safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      simufilam 100 mg in subjects who have completed the RETHINK-ALZ or REFOCUS-ALZ Phase 3&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-national, multi-center, fixed-dose, 52-week, open-label extension study.&#xD;
      After completing participation in either RETHINK-ALZ (PTI-125-06) or REFOCUS-ALZ&#xD;
      (PTI-125-07), subjects will have the option to participate in this study. After the subject&#xD;
      provides consent and the Investigator confirms the subject satisfies both inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, the study drug will be administered at the research site on Study Day 1&#xD;
      and subsequent visits will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate up to 1600 subjects may enroll in this study. Approximately up to 150 clinical&#xD;
      sites in the USA, Canada, South Korea, and Australia will have the option to participate in&#xD;
      this collaborative research effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects electing to participate, the clinical and laboratory assessments from the Week&#xD;
      76 (REFOCUS-ALZ) or Week 52 (RETHINK-ALZ) End-of-Treatment visit will serve as Baseline Visit&#xD;
      assessments for the open-label study on Study Day 1. All subjects will return in 4 weeks and&#xD;
      every 12 weeks thereafter for safety assessments. At all post-baseline visits, subjects will&#xD;
      report any adverse events since their last visit. In addition to adverse event monitoring,&#xD;
      safety will be evaluated at every visit by vital signs, brief examinations, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) and the Columbia Suicide Severity&#xD;
      Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Study drug use since the last visit will be assessed and a new bottle&#xD;
      of study drug will be dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emerging subject safety assessments will be monitored throughout the study by an&#xD;
      independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).&#xD;
