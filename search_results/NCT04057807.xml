      To examine the differences in the capacity to activate microglia in patients with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease (AD) compared to age-comparable cognitively normal subjects and younger healthy&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome is Microglia Activation Reserve Index (MARI) (calculated in the parietal&#xD;
      region of interest (ROIs)) in AD patients compared to elderly controls. The researchers will&#xD;
      recruit up to 20 participants. The investigators will use 7 AD and 7 comparably aged&#xD;
      cognitively normal successfully scanned subjects to calculate the microglial activation&#xD;
      reserve index. The expectations are significant differences between the two groups suggesting&#xD;
      altered reactivity of the microglia in AD. The result would be an exciting one suggesting at&#xD;
      least one mechanism by which some patients with significant amyloid load have progressive&#xD;
      dementia while comparable others are either cognitively normal or have stable Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (MCI). It will also suggest avenues for intervention in amyloid positive MCIs to&#xD;
      prevent progression to Alzheimer's dementia. The exploratory analysis will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effects of aging on MARI: The researchers will evaluate the effects of aging on MARI.&#xD;
           Comparisons will be made for MARI between cognitively normal elderly and the 8 healthy&#xD;
           individuals to whom the investigators applied this protocol in an earlier study. The&#xD;
           reactivity of microglia is reported to change with age and so the investigators expect&#xD;
           MARI to change in the cognitively normal elderly. However, the expectation is that the&#xD;
           differences between the young and elderly cognitively normal subjects to be small&#xD;
           relative to the comparison of AD and elderly normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effects of amyloid on MARI: The researchers will look at the relationship of regional&#xD;
           and global amyloid load to MARI. The presence of a relationship suggests that one of the&#xD;
           reasons for altered microglial reactivity might be interactions of microglia with&#xD;
           pathologic amyloid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Effects of MARI on cognition: The researchers will explore whether MARI would correlate&#xD;
           with the measure of disease stage, with higher MARIs associated with worse&#xD;
           neuropsychological score and more severe disease. The researchers will look for&#xD;
           correlations between MARI and the individual neuropsychological scores. This would&#xD;
           determine if disease severity is correlated with microglial activation reserve.&#xD;
