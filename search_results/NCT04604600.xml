      Background and objectives Owing to the aging problem, cognitive impairment has been a&#xD;
      worldwide health issue. Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are&#xD;
      the two most common causes. It has been reported that VCI and AD share many common risk&#xD;
      factors. MRI is essential in assessing the extent, location and type of vascular lesions.&#xD;
      Amyloid PET has been used in detecting cerebral amyloid burden non-invasively since 2004.&#xD;
      There are only small number of studies using amyloid PET in VCI and the results are still&#xD;
      controversial. In the current proposal, we will investigate&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the correlation of clinical risk factors, ApoE genotype, various MRI markers, and&#xD;
           amyloid PET expression&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. assess the influence of ApoE genotype on different biomarkers, including MRI markers,&#xD;
           amyloid retention, and plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the potential of amyloid PET as a prognostic factor for VCI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods This study will be conducted in National Taiwan University Hospital and&#xD;
      Bei-Hu Branch Hospital. Sixty clinical diagnosed VCI, 30 AD patients and 30 normal subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this 3-year prospective study. We will collect vascular risk factors,&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests, 10 cc venous blood for plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, total tau and&#xD;
      phosphorylated level measurement by IMR assay, ApoE genotype, brain MRI, and amyloid PET of&#xD;
      each patient and control subject. All the data will be analyzed together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results We will try to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. establish the correlation of plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 level, ApoE genotype, MRI imaging&#xD;
           markers in the diagnosis and prognosis of VCI patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. understand more on the pathophysiology of VCI.&#xD;
