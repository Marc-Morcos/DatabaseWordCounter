    <textblock>
      Tau protein has been identified as one of the key pathological features of Tau&#xD;
      proteinopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP),&#xD;
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Tau protein-targeted PET imaging can detect the amount and&#xD;
      distribution of Tau protein deposition in human body, and has great research and application&#xD;
      value in the diagnosis and evaluation of Tau protein disease. This study will be the first to&#xD;
      introduce a complete quantitative, repeatable detection and analysis method in China. For the&#xD;
      SV2a tracer [18F]MNI-1126, cross-sectional evaluation of its imaging in patients with Tau&#xD;
      protein-related diseases and normal controls will be carried out. Later, longitudinal&#xD;
      clinical symptoms and two tracers will be evaluated in patients with Tau protein-related&#xD;
      diseases and normal controls.([18F]APN1607 and [18F]MNI1126) Imaging follow-up to explore&#xD;
      longitudinal changes in brain Tau protein deposition and synaptic density in Tau&#xD;
      protein-related diseases, thus providing support for future clinical drug trials using&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers.&#xD;

      Tau protein has been identified as one of the key pathological features of Tau protein&#xD;
      diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP),&#xD;
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Tau protein targeting PET imaging can detect the amount and&#xD;
      distribution of Tau protein deposition in human body. It has significant research and&#xD;
      application value in diagnosis and evaluation for Tau protein diseases. Previous studies have&#xD;
      shown that Tau radiotracer can detect Tau pathology in early stage of AD, and Tau signal&#xD;
      increases as the disease progresses. In addition, Tau binding may be associated with&#xD;
      increased cognitive impairment in AD subjects. [18F] APN-1607 is a newly developed PET&#xD;
      imaging agent targeting to Tau protein, which has high affinity with Tau protein in brain&#xD;
      tissue of AD patients, high selectivity for Aβ protein, MAO-A and MAO-B, and no non-specific&#xD;
      uptake in normal brain tissue. Toxicological studies show that intravenous injection of [18F]&#xD;
      APN-1607 with dosage less than 20μg is safe. Its clinical research has been initiated in the&#xD;
      United States, Japan and Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2) is a membrane protein in presynaptic envelope. SV2 is&#xD;
      an important component of normal synaptic function and plays an important role in&#xD;
      neurotransmitter release. Three isomers of SV2 are known, of which SV2A is the only subtype&#xD;
      distributed throughout the brain. Studies have shown that synaptic loss in hippocampus and&#xD;
      cerebral cortex is closely related to cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Therefore,&#xD;
      PET imaging and quantification of SV2A signal may be an excellent representative of synaptic&#xD;
      density in vivo, which can be used to measure the brain level of SV2A in Alzheimer's disease,&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease or other neurological and psychiatric diseases, and potentially as a&#xD;
      biomarker of synaptic density in neurodegenerative diseases. Researchers have reported the&#xD;
      development and evaluation of 18F labeled tracers for SV2A protein imaging. The best&#xD;
      candidate [18F] MNI-1126 has shown excellent in vivo binding properties in preliminary&#xD;
      studies in non-human primates. These preliminary in vivo pre-clinical evaluations suggest&#xD;
      that [18F] MNI-1126 exhibits excellent quality as a F-18 labeled PET tracer for multicenter&#xD;
      SV2A imaging trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greatest advantage of PET imaging technology is that it can visualize the structure or&#xD;
      function of tissues and organs which could not be observed in vivo without trauma. Visual&#xD;
      observation of the distribution of radioactivity concentration in PET images can&#xD;
      qualitatively distinguish the positive and negative cases. Standard uptake value ratio (SUVR)&#xD;
      can be used to semi-quantitatively analyze the abnormal uptake of a region of interest in&#xD;
      patients for clinical and daily work. However, in the development of new molecular targeting&#xD;
      markers, in order to make better use of the information in images to obtain the parameters&#xD;
      and contents of molecular markers such as distribution, miss targeting or not, condition for&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier passage ,and stability, a complete set of quantitative and repetitive&#xD;
      detection and analysis methods should be applied. It includes detection of radioactivity in&#xD;
      arterial blood, detection of metabolites of molecular markers, dynamic modeling of PET,&#xD;
      repeated measurement and analysis, and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring radioactive activity of arterial blood is a method to obtain the input parameters&#xD;
      of molecular targeted markers in the brain by detecting the radioactivity of per unit volume&#xD;
      in arterial blood at multiple time points. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) can&#xD;
      be used to detect the metabolites of molecular markers with radioactivity, which can be used&#xD;
      to calibrate the total radioactivity of arterial blood samples and obtain the concentration&#xD;
      of free molecular targeted markers in arterial plasma. On the basis of acquiring the input&#xD;
      parameters of brain molecular targeting markers, the dynamic behavior of a given PET tracer&#xD;
      can be described by establishing a dynamic model of radiotracer and estimating the relevant&#xD;
      parameters. The required data can be obtained under the minimum possible traumatic&#xD;
      conditions, and then the parameters related to physiological, biochemical or metabolic&#xD;
      processes can be quantitatively estimated. Then through repeated measurements of brain&#xD;
      molecular targeting markers, that is, multiple scans of the same molecular marker and the&#xD;
      same patient at different time points, the results of the two scans can be qualitatively and&#xD;
      quantitatively analyzed and compared, and the pharmacokinetics of the markers in the brain,&#xD;
      the properties of binding targets and the stability between batches can be further obtained.&#xD;
      However, because of the intolerance of patients and other factors in the study of arterial&#xD;
      blood radioactivity detection and repeated measurement for radioactive markers, although it&#xD;
      is a mature PET-related research technology around the world, it has not been effectively&#xD;
      carried out in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will introduce a complete quantitative and repetitive analysis method for&#xD;
      the first time in China to evaluate the cross-sectional imaging of Tau protein tracer&#xD;
      [18F]APN-1607 and SV2a tracer [18F] MNI-1126 in patients with Tau protein-related diseases&#xD;
      and normal controls. Subsequently, the longitudinal changes of Tau protein deposition and&#xD;
      synaptic density in the brain of patients with Tau protein-related diseases will be explored&#xD;
      through the evaluation of longitudinal clinical symptoms and follow-up of two kinds of tracer&#xD;
      ([18F]APN1607 and [18F]MNI1126) imaging in patients with Tau protein-related diseases and&#xD;
      normal controls, so as to provide support for the design of clinical trials using imaging&#xD;
      biomarkers in the future.&#xD;
