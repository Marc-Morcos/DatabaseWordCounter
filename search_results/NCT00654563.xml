      The study is designed to collect data regarding the clinical course and outcome of patients&#xD;
      suffering from memory disorders. Visits are charged to the individual's insurance inclusive&#xD;
      of Medicare. Patients benefit from expert evaluation and treatment recommendations.&#xD;
      Participants may be eligible for participation in experimental treatments in the future.&#xD;

      The purpose of this long-term, observational patient outcome registry at Cedars-Sinai Medical&#xD;
      Center is to collect information about subjects with memory disorders from their clinical&#xD;
      care and treatment outcome(s). It plans to examine predictors of treatment outcomes among&#xD;
      those individuals who enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no curative treatments for memory disorders, and this study hopes to&#xD;
      collect information on the disorders. Over the next 6 years, this registry expects to recruit&#xD;
      600 adults over the age of 18 who are concerned that they may have a memory problem, or who&#xD;
      have been diagnosed with a memory problem such as occurs in Age Associated Memory Impairment,&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease, Vascular Dementia, Mixed Dementia, Dementia with Lewy Bodies,&#xD;
      Frontotemporal Dementia, Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Memory Disorders Program owes its existence to patients agreeing to have their clinical&#xD;
      information kept in a database for quality control and research purposes. This data will&#xD;
      include physical and cognitive exams, laboratory tests and scans as well as information about&#xD;
      their medications. Many potential subjects will call in with interest in our Memory Disorders&#xD;
      Program, and a preliminary screening process will be performed over the phone. All potential&#xD;
      subjects would be sent an informed consent document to look at before reviewing it with the&#xD;
      study coordinator. Once they arrive at their initial visit, the research registry and its&#xD;
      optional substudy (a postmortem exam available to all Cedars-Sinai patients) would be&#xD;
      discussed with unlimited time for questions. If the subject, or his/ her surrogate decision&#xD;
      maker (legally authorized representative, or LAR), consents to research, then his/ her&#xD;
      clinical test results and (if applicable) the results of the postmortem exam will be kept on&#xD;
      file for research purposes. If the subject/LAR consents, he/ she may also be contacted about&#xD;
      any future research studies for which he/ she may be eligible. Patients who elect not to&#xD;
      participate in this research will not be contacted for future studies. However, for those who&#xD;
      are found to be ineligible and would like to learn about future studies as they arise, the&#xD;
      Memory Disorders ICF offers them the option to be contacted in the future as new studies&#xD;
      become available to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will involve no collaborations, inside or outside of the Cedars-Sinai&#xD;
      Medical Center. However, the subject's clinical care will involve collaborations with other&#xD;
      departments within Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry will not involve any research-related costs, or any remunerative incentive.&#xD;

      The main Memory Disorders Registry only involves records-keeping to follow subjects' care,&#xD;
      and does not involve any biospecimen collection. The optional postmortem exam (brain-only&#xD;
      autopsy) obtains brain tissue, and it would be performed after death, so that no risks will&#xD;
      impact the subject involved in the postmortem examination. With regard to cosmetic concerns,&#xD;
      the incision is made from ear to ear through the neck region, leaving no disfiguration. The&#xD;
      postmortem exam is not a genetic screen, but in rare instances it might find brain atrophy,&#xD;
      although no specific inclusions. If found, the subject's family would be informed of this&#xD;
      finding.&#xD;
