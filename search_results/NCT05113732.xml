      This study aimed to investigate relationship between cognitive function and functional&#xD;
      mobility in Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that the decrease in cognitive function in individuals with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease is associated with the level of functional mobility. Sociodemographic information of&#xD;
      participants will be recorded. Cognition will assessed with Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
      (MoCA), global score and MoCA's visuospatial executive functions, naming, attention,&#xD;
      language, abstract thinking, delayed recall, orientation sub-scores will recorded. Functional&#xD;
      mobility will assessed Timed Up and Go Test and 5 Times Sit&amp;Stand Test.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assesment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>MoCA assesses cognitive skills such as visuospatial / executive functioning, object naming, memory, attention, language, abstraction, orientation. Higher scores reflect the better performance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Timed Up and Go Test measures the level of functional mobility skills and, assess fall risk and balance. The time elapsed between standing up from the sitting position, walking the distance of 3 meters, coming back and sitting back on the chair is recorded. The shorter time reflect the better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>5 Time Sit to Stand Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>5 Time Sit to Stand Test measures the level of functional mobility skills and, assess fall risk and lower extremity strength. The test measures the time taken to stand five times from a sitting position as quickly as possible. The shorter time reflect the better performance.</description>
