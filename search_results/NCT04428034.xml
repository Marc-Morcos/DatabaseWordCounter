  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Learning Skills Together (LST) program is a synchronous web-based educational&#xD;
      intervention developed to address the essential need for training to equip family caregivers&#xD;
      to someone with mid-stage Alzheimer's disease to confidently provide complex care tasks.The&#xD;
      purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of delivering LST, the program's&#xD;
      acceptability to caregivers, and likelihood of effecting caregivers self-efficacy and&#xD;
      mastery.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Caregiver Competency</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks post-intervention; and to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using the Caregiving Competence Scale. This measure includes 3-items pertaining to caregiver's confidence (e.g., &quot;I feel confident that I am meeting the needs of my relative&quot;). There are five response options to each statement (&quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; [1] to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; [5]), such that scores may range from 3 to 15. A lower score indicates a lower level of confidence that the caregiver is meeting their relative's needs (i.e., higher scores are better). The outcome measure will use the average change score from baseline scores.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Mastery</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks post-intervention; and to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using the Caregiver Mastery Scale. This 7-item scale asks participants the extent to which they feel they have control over various parts of their lives (e.g., &quot;I have little control over the things that happen to me&quot;). Participants may respond that they &quot;Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly agree (4) with each statement, such that scores range from 7 to 28. The lower the score, the less control the caregiver feels that they have control (i.e., higher scores are better). The mean score for this measure among caregivers to frail older adults was previously reported as 19.42 (SD 3.29), with Cronbach's alpha of 0.78. The outcome measure will use the average change score from baseline scores.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Learning Skills Together program will begin their participation with a one-on-one phone call with an interventionist, who will ensure the participant is prepared to to attend the group sessions (e.g., familiar with videoconference technology) and will help the participant to set individual goals. The caregiver participant will then attend 4, group-based sessions lasting approximately 1.5 hours each, to learn about common complex care tasks managed by family caregivers to someone with mid-stage Alzheimer's disease, such as managing behavioral symptoms of dementia, incontinence, nutrition, transferring, medication management, and more. Sessions will integrate interactive activities, such as videos, case studies, and discussions. Approximately four weeks later, caregivers will be asked to attend a group reflection session to discuss application of what was learned and progress in meeting individual goals.</description>

          <description>Measured using the Caregiver Competency Scale, a 3 item scale. Each scale has 5 responses: Never (0), to All of the time (5). Scores range from 3-15 with a lower score indicating less confidence in providing for relative's needs.</description>

Responses range from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (4). Range of scores are from 7-28, with a lower score showing that the caregiver believes they have less control.</description>

        <title>Change in Caregiver Competency</title>
        <description>This will be measured using the Caregiving Competence Scale. This measure includes 3-items pertaining to caregiver's confidence (e.g., &quot;I feel confident that I am meeting the needs of my relative&quot;). There are five response options to each statement (&quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; [1] to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; [5]), such that scores may range from 3 to 15. A lower score indicates a lower level of confidence that the caregiver is meeting their relative's needs (i.e., higher scores are better). The outcome measure will use the average change score from baseline scores.</description>

            <description>Participants in the Learning Skills Together program will begin their participation with a one-on-one phone call with an interventionist, who will ensure the participant is prepared to to attend the group sessions (e.g., familiar with videoconference technology) and will help the participant to set individual goals. The caregiver participant will then attend 4, group-based sessions lasting approximately 1.5 hours each, to learn about common complex care tasks managed by family caregivers to someone with mid-stage Alzheimer's disease, such as managing behavioral symptoms of dementia, incontinence, nutrition, transferring, medication management, and more. Sessions will integrate interactive activities, such as videos, case studies, and discussions. Approximately four weeks later, caregivers will be asked to attend a group reflection session to discuss application of what was learned and progress in meeting individual goals.&#xD;

        <title>Change in Caregiver Mastery</title>
        <description>This will be measured using the Caregiver Mastery Scale. This 7-item scale asks participants the extent to which they feel they have control over various parts of their lives (e.g., &quot;I have little control over the things that happen to me&quot;). Participants may respond that they &quot;Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly agree (4) with each statement, such that scores range from 7 to 28. The lower the score, the less control the caregiver feels that they have control (i.e., higher scores are better). The mean score for this measure among caregivers to frail older adults was previously reported as 19.42 (SD 3.29), with Cronbach's alpha of 0.78. The outcome measure will use the average change score from baseline scores.</description>
