  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to improve the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at two&#xD;
      different stages (MCI and dementia) in illiterate subjects, using FDG- fluorodeoxyglucose -&#xD;
      and florbetapir F 18 -PET imaging. This study will compare amyloid load and cerebral&#xD;
      metabolism dysfunction in literate versus illiterate MCI and AD patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Illiterate, with a higher rate in the elder and in multi-cultural population reaching, then,&#xD;
      20%. Most of these patients are not usually included in research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, AVILL would specifically focus on lower educated and illiterate patients and on use of&#xD;
      PET imaging for early diagnosis. This study would take advantage of the collaboration with&#xD;
      the recently launched Memento cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The diagnosis of AD at the early stages of the disease appears to be crucial. MCI is now&#xD;
           considered as the 1st clinical stage of the disease, after a long pre-clinical period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cognitive reserve modulates the relationship between cerebral lesions and their clinical&#xD;
           manifestations by limiting the negative impact of cerebral lesion on cognition.&#xD;
           Education is a commonly-used proxy of cognitive reserve. Education interacts with AD&#xD;
           pathology such that a greater pathological burden is required to show an effect on&#xD;
           cognition among subjects with more education. Lower education and illiteracy are thus&#xD;
           considered as risk factor of developing AD&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnosing MCI and AD in lower educated and illiterate patients is a real challenge&#xD;
           because of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. -difficulties in cognitive evaluation which mostly relies on educational background&#xD;
                and reading abilities,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. -poor adaptation of neuropsychological tests,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. -lack of clinical and imaging data concerning these patients, who are often&#xD;
                excluded from studies, and poor knowledge of the evolution of the disease from the&#xD;
                earlier signs (MCI) to dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quantification of amyloid deposit by PET imaging could therefore be useful for the&#xD;
           diagnosis of AD in illiterate patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  non educated patient amyloid load could differ from educated patient amyloid load at the&#xD;
           same stage of cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET amyloid imaging using florbetapir F 18 could detect non educated patients with AD&#xD;
           risk at early stage and could help clinical evaluation which is particularly difficult&#xD;
           in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  uptake level of florbetapir F 18 could be different in MCI and AD non educated patients&#xD;
           compared to educated patients which are the basis of the objectives.&#xD;
