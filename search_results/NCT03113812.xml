        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinical diagnosis suggesting Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on the criteria of the&#xD;
             National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's&#xD;
             Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The results of the patient's MRI brain scan had to be concordant with the diagnosis of&#xD;
             AD according to the following criteria: Scheltens scale, and quantitative measurement&#xD;
             of white matter and past hemorrhages.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) assessed as mild or moderate using the Mini&#xD;
             Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale. Mild or moderate AD was confirmed if the MMSE&#xD;
             score varied between 15 and 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The Hachinski ischemic scale was used to distinguish AD from multi-infarct dementia. A&#xD;
             score of ≤4 suggested AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Score on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) of 0.5 or 1.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Be receiving a stable dose of treatment for AD for three months before the selection&#xD;
             visit, and expecting to continue treatment for the duration of the study (if&#xD;
             appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Stable treatment for other illnesses may be administered 30 days prior to V0&#xD;
             (selection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Males or females from 50 to 85 years of age, inclusive (at the time of signing&#xD;
             informed consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient (or a close relative or legal representative) should read the patient&#xD;
             information sheet, agreed to participate in the clinical trial and signed Inform&#xD;
             consent (IC) (the patient and a close relative or legal representative).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Presence of a stable caregiver willing to attend patient visits during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Sufficient visual and auditory capacity to undertake the neuropsychological tests.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Pregnant women or women of child-bearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients whose general state of health was such that it did not allow completion of&#xD;
             the trial or that made taking part in the trial difficult, as judged by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participation in another clinical trial in the 3 months prior to visit 0 or during the&#xD;
             12 months prior to the selection visit in the case of patients who had participated in&#xD;
             trials where the study drug was aimed at modifying the progression of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known allergy to the vaccine components or history of anaphylaxis, severe allergic&#xD;
             reaction or history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the formulation.&#xD;

          5. Absolute (having a pacemaker or implantable defibrillator) or relative (bare metal&#xD;
             stent or stent implanted in the last 6 months) contraindications to MRI examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Surgery (with general anesthetic) during the 3 months prior to admission into the&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Major systemic condition (e.g. chronic renal failure, chronic hepatopathy,&#xD;
             uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, other deficiencies).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of asthma or reactive airway disease presenting as bronchospasm in the last 6&#xD;
             months or currently on a regular anti-asthmatic drug treatment.&#xD;

         13. Poorly controlled diseases like poorly controlled hypertension (systolic arterial&#xD;
             tension &gt;160 mmHg or diastolic arterial tension &gt;100 mmHg, as an average of 3&#xD;
             measurements) or poorly controlled diabetes according to the investigator's opinion&#xD;
