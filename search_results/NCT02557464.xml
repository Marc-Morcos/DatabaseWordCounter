    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify early and accurate semantics markers of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) by using two types of methods. First, the investigator will evaluate&#xD;
      semantic processing of patients with AD or related disorders which will be compared to age&#xD;
      matched controls by taking neuropsychological tests. Then, the investigator will analyze the&#xD;
      effect of contextual word predictability on eye movements in reading sentences with the help&#xD;
      of the same participants by using an eye tracker. Both of these methods will be used twice&#xD;
      with a time interval of 6 months.&#xD;

      Scientific background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) as early as possible should enable to propose a&#xD;
      re-education platform that would fit the early stage of neuronal loss in this pathology.&#xD;
      Neuropsychological evaluations are currently one of the main tools for the early screening of&#xD;
      AD. Among the tests proposed during those evaluations, the investigator find the Isaacs Set&#xD;
      Test which evaluates the early degradation of semantic memory. Whereas eyes movement behavior&#xD;
      during reading is sensitive to semantics factors and allows collecting accurate measurements&#xD;
      (as precisely as one millisecond), no study has yet used this technique to precisely identify&#xD;
      the precocious semantics troubles of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to identify early and accurate markers of AD by associating&#xD;
      semantic neuropsychological assessments and eye tracking during sentences reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 24 patients with AD or related disorders (Mini Mental State&#xD;
      Examination between 20 and 27 ) and 24 age matched controls participants. The experiment will&#xD;
      be divided in two steps. First, patients will take a standard neuropsychological evaluation.&#xD;
      A specific semantic analysis will be performed on each participant using, for example, the&#xD;
      Isaacs Set Test or the Weschler Similarities. The second step will ask the participants to&#xD;
      read sentences while an eye tracker (the Eye Link 1000 remote) will record their eyes&#xD;
      movements. In order to manipulate semantics factors, each sentence will contain a target&#xD;
      word, either predictable or not. The experiment will last one hour and a half.&#xD;
      Neuropsychological assessments and eye tracking will be done twice with a time interval of 6&#xD;
      months. The two times will be called T1 and T2 and are required to estimate whether eye&#xD;
      tracking is a better predictor of AD than neuropsychological tests or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eye tracking technique enables to record different sorts of measures. More specifically,&#xD;
      the investigator will evaluate gaze duration on the target word. Moreover, neuropsychological&#xD;
      tests scores will be collected. It will be, for example, the number of good answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the investigator expect that the predictability effect on eye movements would be less&#xD;
      pronounced for patients with AD or related disorders than for the control group. This effect&#xD;
      would be even more diminished at T2. It could be explained by a progressive degradation of&#xD;
      the semantic memory of patients. Then, and for the same reasons, the investigator expect that&#xD;
      the scores collected from the neuropsychological tests would be pathological for patient&#xD;
      suffering from AD or related disorders. The test scores would be even more in deficit at T2.&#xD;
      Finally, the investigator predict a correlation between neuropsychological tests data and eye&#xD;
      movements data. With an extrapolation, and because eye movements recording allow us to obtain&#xD;
      more accurate information about the quality of semantic processes, the investigator formulate&#xD;
      the hypothesis that this technique will help to predict earlier AD.&#xD;
