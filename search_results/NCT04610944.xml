  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease has identified education of dementia care&#xD;
      providers as a top priority to address the need for quality care for the population of&#xD;
      persons with dementia that will triple in the next 30 years. This study will test new online&#xD;
      interactive training for nursing home staff that improves staff communication and also&#xD;
      reduces behavioral symptoms of persons with dementia that they care for. Innovative&#xD;
      approaches to reach care providers are essential to achieve implementation of evidence-based&#xD;
      practices to improve care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new person is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia every 65 seconds, and&#xD;
      most persons living with dementia (PWD) spend the late stages of dementia in nursing homes&#xD;
      (NHs) where shortages of staff and lack of dementia care skills limit quality of care. Care&#xD;
      of PWD is complicated by behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as&#xD;
      aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as PWD lose cognitive and&#xD;
      communication abilities and cannot express their unmet physical and psychosocial needs. BPSD&#xD;
      present to NH staff as resistiveness to care (RTC) that increases staff stress and costly&#xD;
      time to complete care, often leading to staff turnover, injury, and inappropriate use of&#xD;
      psychotropic medications to control BPSD. Although Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services&#xD;
      (CMS) mandates and penalties have reduced NH antipsychotic medication use slightly,&#xD;
      contraindicated use in NH residents remains a pervasive problem, causing harmful side effects&#xD;
      and reducing the quality of life for PWD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI and other researchers have empirically verified that RTC occurs when NH staff use&#xD;
      elderspeak (speech similar to baby talk) that features inappropriately intimate terms of&#xD;
      endearment (diminutives such as &quot;honey&quot;), belittling pronoun substitutions that imply&#xD;
      dependence (&quot;we&quot; need a bath), and harsh task-oriented commands (&quot;sit down&quot;). Elderspeak&#xD;
      conveys a message of disrespect and incompetence to residents who react with withdrawal or&#xD;
      BPSD. Our R03 study established that when staff use elderspeak instead of normal adult&#xD;
      communication, residents with dementia are more than twice as likely to exhibit BPSD&#xD;
      (measured by coding RTC behavior in videos). Our subsequent R01 clinical trial verified that&#xD;
      staff reduced their use of elderspeak communication after attending the three-session&#xD;
      Changing Talk (CHAT) program and that this reduced RTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHAT training is effective in changing staff communication practices and reducing RTC but&#xD;
      requires an onsite trainer, limiting accessibility and feasibility for dissemination.&#xD;
      Increasing access to this effective training, which improves communication and acts as a&#xD;
      nonpharmacological intervention to reduce BPSD, is the next logical step. To facilitate&#xD;
      dissemination, interactive online modules (CHATO) with the same CHAT content were developed&#xD;
      and pilot-tested, establishing preliminary effects and increased participation by busy NH&#xD;
      staff. We anticipate that this online training will increase access to training and the&#xD;
      translation of evidence-based content and skill practice at reduced cost extending reach&#xD;
      nationally to include small and rural NHs. Support for NH administrators will optimize staff&#xD;
      engagement, implementation, and maintenance of CHATO skills in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This competitive renewal resubmission builds on R01 NR011455, &quot;Changing Talk to Reduce&#xD;
      Resistiveness to Dementia Care&quot; demonstrating the 3-session CHAT intervention decreased staff&#xD;
      elderspeak and reduced resident RTC.13 Online CHATO modules provide asynchronous, independent&#xD;
      access for busy NH staff. Linear mixed modeling will be used to compare CHATO and CONTROL&#xD;
      group change in BPSD and psychotropic medication use (from CMS and Nursing Home Compare&#xD;
      data). CHATO is an innovative nonpharmacological intervention that reduces BPSD. Online&#xD;
      delivery will increase cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AIM 1. Test effects of CHATO on BPSD and psychotropic medication use in 120 NHs.&#xD;
           Hypothesis: Reductions in BPSD and psychotropic medication use (extracted from CMS&#xD;
           Minimum Data set and Nursing Home Compare Quality Measures) will occur for individual&#xD;
           residents and within NH facilities in the CHATO vs CONTROL group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AIM 2. Test strategies to engage staff and maximize CHATO effects. We will conduct a&#xD;
           mixed-method process evaluation evaluating implementation strategies and supports to&#xD;
           assist NHs in approach, motivation, and incentives to improve dissemination. NH&#xD;
           characteristics and implementation strategies used will be analyzed in relation to&#xD;
           participation rates, knowledge gain, and changes in primary outcomes. Interviews and&#xD;
           focus groups will be conducted by our external evaluator. Hypothesis: Primary outcomes&#xD;
           will vary by secondary outcomes; identifying most effective NH characteristics and&#xD;
           strategies for implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. AIM 3. Evaluate cost and sustainability. Data envelopment analysis will identify CHATO&#xD;
           costs in relation to BPSD reductions. NHs will complete a 1-year follow-up survey to&#xD;
           report on their adoption and maintenance. Hypothesis: BPSD reductions will vary in cost;&#xD;
           identifying the most efficient means of dissemination and NH sustainability will vary&#xD;
           depending on adoption factors.&#xD;
