    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to determine the feasibility and potential efficacy of&#xD;
      remotely delivered group exercise sessions to increase daily moderate to vigorous physical&#xD;
      activity in adults with Down syndrome, relative to a usual care control. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to attend 40 min remotely delivered group moderate to vigorous physical activity&#xD;
      (MVPA) sessions at low frequency (1 session/wk.,RL), high frequency (3 sessions/wk., RH), or&#xD;
      usual care control usual care control (UC). In addition to the group MVPA sessions,&#xD;
      participants in both the RL and RH groups will also receive a step counter, access to&#xD;
      resources for increasing MVPA, and one 20-min remotely delivered individual support/education&#xD;
      session/wk. Content for both the RL and RH arms will be identical with the exception of group&#xD;
      session frequency (1 vs. 3/wk.). Participants in the UC arm will receive a step counter,&#xD;
      access to resources for increasing MVPA, and monthly remote individual support/education).The&#xD;
      primary aim is to Assess daily MVPA (min) in the RL, RH, and UC arms at baseline, 3, 6, 9,&#xD;
      and 12 mos., and obtain effect sizes for change in MVPA over 12-mos.Secondary Aim 1 is to&#xD;
      assess the impact of MVPA on cardiovascular fitness, quality of life, cognitive function, and&#xD;
      brain parameters related to Alzheimer's Disease (whole and regional brain volume, functional&#xD;
      connectivity, and cerebral blood flow) at baseline, 6, and 12 mos. Secondary Aim 2 will&#xD;
      determine the feasibility (retention, session attendance, use of recorded sessions (RH/RL&#xD;
      only) of RL, RH, and UC interventions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research study will compare 3 strategies for the delivery of an intervention to increase&#xD;
      moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in community dwelling adults with Down&#xD;
      Syndrome; remotely delivered group MVPA sessions at low (1 session/wk.,RL), high frequency (3&#xD;
      sessions/wk., RH), or usual care control (UC). Adults (age â‰¥ 18 yrs.) with Down Syndrome will&#xD;
      be randomized (2:2:1) to one of the 3 intervention arms for an 12-mo. trial. Cohorts of ~20&#xD;
      adults with Down Syndrome will be recruited and computer randomized. Participants will be&#xD;
      stratified by sex and sequentially randomized by the study statistician. Participants in all&#xD;
      arms will be provided with an iPad for intervention delivery, Fitbit for self-monitoring MPA,&#xD;
      and will be asked to complete 150 min of MPA/wk. Participants in the RL and RH arms will be&#xD;
      asked to complete 40 minutes MVPA sessions delivered via Zoom software on an iPad, RL will be&#xD;
      provided 1 session/wk, and RH will be provided 3 sessions/wk. Participants in both the RL and&#xD;
      RH groups will also receive one 20-min remotely delivered individual support/education&#xD;
      session/wk. with a heath coach to discuss progress and provide support. The UC intervention&#xD;
      will follow the traditional approach to promote increased MVPA. Participants will receive an&#xD;
      iPad tablet loaded with information regarding increasing MVPA and will also receive&#xD;
      resistance bands and a Fitbit for self-monitoring MVPA. Monthly 20-min. education/support&#xD;
      sessions, identical to the education/support sessions provided in the RL and RH arms, will be&#xD;
      delivered to participants and their caregivers remotely on the iPad using FaceTime. All&#xD;
      outcomes will be collected by trained research assistants who are blinded to the study&#xD;
      condition. The primary outcome, daily MVPA (min) in the RL, RH, and UC arms will be assessed&#xD;
      at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 mos. using an accelerometer. All secondary outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed at baselines, 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes are to assess the impact of MVPA&#xD;
      across the RL, RH, and UC arms on cardiovascular fitness, quality of life, cognitive function&#xD;
      and brain parameters related to Alzheimer's Disease (whole and regional brain volume,&#xD;
      functional connectivity, cerebral blood flow). Additionally the researchers will determine&#xD;
      the feasibility (retention, session attendance, use of recorded sessions (RH/RL only) and&#xD;
      safety of RL, RH, and UC arms.&#xD;
