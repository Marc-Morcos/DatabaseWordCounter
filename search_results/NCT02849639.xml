  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine the impact on cognitive reserve of a pharmacist-physician&#xD;
      patient-centered medication therapy management intervention to address inappropriate&#xD;
      medication use as identified by the Beers 2015 list. By bolstering cognitive reserve, this&#xD;
      project will directly address the National Alzheimer's Project Act 2015 priorities serving to&#xD;
      delay onset of symptoms in preclinical dementia. The results of this study will provide&#xD;
      valuable insights on how to expand this intervention to reduce the prevalence and associated&#xD;
      healthcare costs of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-month, parallel arm, study to be conducted at the University of Kentucky. The&#xD;
      study will involve assessing medication use and identifying any medicines that may be&#xD;
      inappropriate for elderly adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, participants will be asked to undergo one amyloid-PET scan to&#xD;
      detect early amyloid plaques in their brain which could increase the risk of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease in the near future. In addition, at the beginning and end of the study, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to use a scopolamine patch. This patch is not being used to prevent motion&#xD;
      sickness (as approved by the FDA), but instead is being used to challenge the participant's&#xD;
      memory and thinking abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of the study includes collecting information regarding participants memory and thinking&#xD;
      abilities. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires as well as memory and&#xD;
      thinking tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study doctor will review participants medical history and then perform routine medical&#xD;
      (physical and neurological) examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two of the study visits will be conducted by phone to check up on the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning, middle, and end of the study, participants will meet with a doctor and&#xD;
      pharmacist to review and make any changes deemed appropriate to their current medicines. This&#xD;
      will be done in order to try and eliminate medicines that are not recommended for the&#xD;
      elderly. These visits are referred to as the Medication Therapy Management (MTM).&#xD;

    <measure>Medication Appropriateness Index</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to end of study, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to end of study. The Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI) rates medications as &quot;appropriate&quot;, &quot;marginally appropriate&quot;, or &quot;inappropriate&quot; based on ten criteria. All medications reported by study participants were evaluated by the study team and assigned a medication-specific MAI. As an outcome measure, the total MAI was obtained by adding the medication specific MAIs for all medications reported by the participant. Minimum score for one medication is 0 (appropriate) and the maximum is 18 (inappropriate for all criteria). Total MAI depends on the number of medications taken by participant. A decrease in MAI from baseline to end of study indicates improvement in medication appropriateness.</description>

    <measure>Trail Making Test B With the Scopolamine Patch</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to end of study, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>End of study for Trail Making Test B with the scopolamine patch. The mean and standard used to compute the TMTB z-scores were taken from a sample of cognitively intact older adult research volunteers (Weintraub et al. 2009; mean = 90.3, SD = 50) (22). Z-scores were then multiplied by -1 to facilitate interpretation, since higher TMTB scores are worse. For the z-score, we converted time in seconds to units of standard deviations from a mean of 0, where 0 represents the mean performance of cognitively intact (normal) older adult research volunteers enrolled in longitudinal studies at Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers in the United States. Scores that are at least 1.5 standard deviations below the mean are indicative of potential cognitive impairment.</description>

We used predefined cut-off points at 1.2 and 1.4 to categorize amyloid burden. Values grater than 1.4 in the absence of cognitive impairment indicate a preclinical Alzheimer's Disease state.</description>

        <title>Trail Making Test B With the Scopolamine Patch</title>
        <description>End of study for Trail Making Test B with the scopolamine patch. The mean and standard used to compute the TMTB z-scores were taken from a sample of cognitively intact older adult research volunteers (Weintraub et al. 2009; mean = 90.3, SD = 50) (22). Z-scores were then multiplied by -1 to facilitate interpretation, since higher TMTB scores are worse. For the z-score, we converted time in seconds to units of standard deviations from a mean of 0, where 0 represents the mean performance of cognitively intact (normal) older adult research volunteers enrolled in longitudinal studies at Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers in the United States. Scores that are at least 1.5 standard deviations below the mean are indicative of potential cognitive impairment.</description>

Z-scores were then multiplied by -1 to facilitate interpretation, since higher TMTB scores are worse. For the z-score, we converted time in seconds to units of standard deviations from a mean of 0, where 0 represents the mean performance of cognitively intact (normal) older adult research volunteers enrolled in longitudinal studies at Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers in the United States. Scores that are at least 1.5 standard deviations below the mean are indicative of potential cognitive impairment.</description>
