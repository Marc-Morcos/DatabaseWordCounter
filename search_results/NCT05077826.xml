  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a low-risk transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES)&#xD;
      treatment that has improved learning and performance in young adults up to nearly 4 times&#xD;
      when compared with a sham control. This randomized pilot trial will determine if this same&#xD;
      tES protocol improves memory in older adults (50-90 years old) who are healthy, and&#xD;
      separately in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early stage Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD). TES will be applied to the right temple and left arm for up to 40 minutes. MRI&#xD;
      images, along with other measures, may be obtained before and after tES. If effective, this&#xD;
      intervention may help to improve the quality of life for AD patients and their families.&#xD;

        Exclusion criteria for healthy participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Significant history of psychiatric disorders or current psychosis including&#xD;
             self-report or Geriatric Depression Scale short form score-GDS &gt;5 if uncertain.&#xD;
