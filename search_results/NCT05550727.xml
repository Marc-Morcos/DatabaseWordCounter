  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a fully embedded pragmatic trial (R01), following an R61 pilot&#xD;
      collaboration with Lutheran Social Service of Minnesota (LSS-MN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this project: a) the training program for Senior Companions that was developed in the R61&#xD;
      Phase will now be delivered as part of a routine onboarding process provided by LSS-MN to all&#xD;
      senior support volunteers in half of their program regions across Minnesota; LSS-MN will&#xD;
      offer the PorchLight Project program to all regions and volunteers in the state during the&#xD;
      final months of the proposed NIA project, consistent with quality improvement approaches; and&#xD;
      b) LSS-MN will administer regular surveys to volunteers, clients, and their proxies (e.g.,&#xD;
      family caregivers) as part of ongoing tracking and quality improvement efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Minnesota investigators will not collect data nor administer training, as&#xD;
      these activities will be fully integrated into the workflow of LSS-MN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA INVOLVEMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Minnesota and collaborating investigators outside of LSS-MN will only 1)&#xD;
      assist in survey item selection, 2) randomize the LSS-MN regions for the initial phases of&#xD;
      the real-world trial for evaluation purposes, 3) analyze the de-identified data shared by&#xD;
      LSS-MN, and 4) disseminate the project results in scientific, practice, and policy&#xD;
      outlets/contexts.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All screening of volunteers, clients, and caregivers will occur outside of the context of&#xD;
        this project and in line with standard practices by LSS-MN Caregiver &amp; Companion Service&#xD;
        programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The eligibility criteria of volunteers, persons with AD/ADRD, and their caregivers is&#xD;
        deliberately lax in order to best reflect LSS-MN &quot;routine practice.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1) A Volunteer, client, or proxy involved in the LSS-MN standard Caregiver &amp; Companion&#xD;
        Program service program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: De-identified programmatic and survey data on the volunteers, clients, and proxies&#xD;
        involved will be shared with the UMN team. While all de-identified data received may be&#xD;
        analyzed, data analysis is expected to focus on those who meet the following additional&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Volunteers who completed LSS-MN required training components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clients who report memory loss and/or a diagnosis for their memory loss, via the&#xD;
             LSS-MN surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Caregivers whose care recipient has memory loss and/or diagnosis for their memory loss&#xD;
             based on LSS survey responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: When discrepancies in reported memory loss between caregivers and clients occur, data&#xD;
        from both the caregiver and client will be included and it will be assumed that the client&#xD;
        has memory loss. Due to the nature of the data, we expect discrepancies to exist and will&#xD;
        document other decisions made during analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        As data is made available, the UMN research team expects to receive survey data from all&#xD;
        the clients, caregivers, and volunteers in LSS-MN Caregiver &amp; Companion Services&#xD;
        programming who complete the surveys. Since LSS-MN administers surveys to every client,&#xD;
        caregiver, and volunteer involved in their LSS-MN Caregiver &amp; Companion program (as able),&#xD;
        de-identified data likely will be obtained from individuals who do not meet the&#xD;
        memory-specific criteria. However, as needed, UMN may choose to exclude one or more of the&#xD;
        following from analysis. Again, the researcher/research staff best judgement will be used&#xD;
        when conducting analyses and will document decisions accordingly:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clients who do not have memory loss&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Treatment group volunteers not completing required LSS-MN PorchLight program training&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Caregivers who do not indicate presence of memory loss for their care recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, any client, caregiver, and volunteer can choose to not complete surveys, so we&#xD;
        would not have survey data from those individuals, and may continue with routine attempts&#xD;
        at surveying at the next data collection time-point. Missing surveys may be considered&#xD;
        during analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Please note: Due to the eligibility criteria for volunteers and clients in the LSS-MN&#xD;
        program, we do not anticipate any data for those under 18 years of age. Although the&#xD;
        real-world, pragmatic design will allow us to include caregivers under the age of 21, it is&#xD;
        important to note that LSS-MN's most recent data on caregivers participating in their&#xD;
        volunteer programs indicate none under the age of 21&#xD;
