      This is a non-randomized, non-treatment, observational study designed to discover&#xD;
      correlations between retinal imaging and amyloid PET imaging. Subjects will be recruited to&#xD;
      the clinical cohort from referring physicians. Subjects may be participants from existing&#xD;
      studies and clinical practices&#xD;

        Up to 100 adults between 50 and 90 years old, and undergoing evaluation for Alzheimer's&#xD;
        Disease or other cognitive impairments will be recruited from the community. Patients will&#xD;
        be asked if they would like to hear about a study related to better diagnostic tools for&#xD;
        cognitive decline and dementias, which is seeking volunteers to undergo a non-invasive eye&#xD;
        scan with a new type of camera. Informed consent will be obtained prior to enrollment in&#xD;
        the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Individuals with reported cognitive complaint (self or from an informant) under&#xD;
             clinical investigation by a health professional for cognitive impairment where&#xD;
             Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the differential diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Demonstrated cognitive impairment as evidenced by at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &lt; 26/30&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score &lt; 26/30&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Score &gt; 1 Standard Deviation below population mean on a standardized&#xD;
                  neuropsychological test, based on normative data from age-, sex-, education-, and&#xD;
                  where possible, race-matched peers [Based on guidelines for detecting Mild&#xD;
                  Cognitive Impairment due to AD (Albert et al., 2011)]&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Cognitive impairment on the above test/s is unable to be fully explained by systemic,&#xD;
             neurological or psychiatric disorders other than Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Capacity to give informed consent by patient or Legally Authorized Representative&#xD;
             (LAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ability to undergo PET and MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any ophthalmologic condition that would prevent obtaining retinal imaging and/or could&#xD;
             interfere with the analysis of the MHRC-C1 images by the CAS, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pupil dilation contraindicated (due to a pathology, or presence of 3 quadrants&#xD;
                  with Van Herick frading of 0 or 1 without iridotomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inadequate pupil dilatation (&lt; 6mm diameter) preventing uniform illumination of&#xD;
                  the retina with the MHRC-C1&#xD;

                  edema) within a diameter of 10 mm from the mid-point between the optic nerve head&#xD;
                  and the macula&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of drusen and/or age-related macular degeneration (AREDS 9-step scale&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Refractive error outside the range of -15 D to +15 D&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Corneal or media opacities (e.g. Weiss ring) affecting retinal imaging on a&#xD;
                  cumulative area &gt; 1 disc area within a diameter of 10 mm from the mid-point&#xD;
                  between the optic nerve head and the macula (i.e. the area of interest for the&#xD;
                  MHRC-C1 imaging)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Scar, atrophy, naevus, tumor, epiretinal membrane or retinal pucker with a&#xD;
                  cumulative area &gt; 1 disc area within a diameter of 10 mm from the mid-point&#xD;
                  between the optic nerve head and the macula&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Papilledema&#xD;
