  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior studies have shown that programs that focus on promoting brain health and managing&#xD;
      lifestyle risks (such as poor diet, obesity, physical inactivity, sleep issues, loneliness)&#xD;
      may help in preventing or lowering the risk of dementia. To address this, investigators have&#xD;
      developed the CAN-THUMBS UP program to conduct studies that target lifestyle risk and focus&#xD;
      on dementia prevention. An online Brain Health Support Program (BHSP) has been developed. The&#xD;
      BHSP is an educational program designed to teach about dementia. Before the full BHSP is&#xD;
      offered to a large group, we are conducting an initial pilot study to help assess the&#xD;
      usability of the program.&#xD;

    <description>The BHSP is an educational program designed to teach about dementia. It aims to provide best available evidence for lifestyle changes that can help lower dementia risk, and to provide specific recommendations for positive lifestyle changes (e.g., physical exercises to try at home, healthy recipes). The program was developed as a collaborative effort by Canadian investigators who have expertise in the different areas of dementia prevention, along with input from older-adult citizen advisors.</description>
