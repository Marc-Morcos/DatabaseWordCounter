  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether an adapted questionnaire called the Care Partner&#xD;
      Hospital Assessment Tool (CHAT) for care partners of hospitalized patients living with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) (CHAT-AD) can help people with dementia&#xD;
      receive better care after they go home from the hospital. Participants will be a care partner&#xD;
      ('family member or friend') who provides unpaid care to a hospitalized adult relative or&#xD;
      partner to help them take care of themselves because of dementia. Participants can expect to&#xD;
      be in this study for 14 days.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to adapt CHAT for care partners of hospitalized patients living&#xD;
      with ADRD (CHAT-AD) and evaluate its feasibility and potential efficacy in a pilot randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial. Findings from this study will enable the lead researcher to launch an&#xD;
      independent program of research that aims to (1) improve hospital-based care processes and&#xD;
      outcomes for patients living with ADRD and their care partners, and (2) make clear the&#xD;
      essential caregiving role that so many care partners of patients living with ADRD assume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to adapt CHAT, there will be two design teams with key stakeholders from local aging&#xD;
      networks and a large academic medical system: one team comprised of previously hospitalized&#xD;
      patients living with ADRD and their care partners (N=7 dyads) and the second comprised of&#xD;
      healthcare system administrators and clinicians (N=7). The team will use a validated&#xD;
      participatory human-centered design process in which each team completes 5 co-design&#xD;
      videoconference sessions that occur in parallel across 4 months, with 2-3 weeks between each&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon adaptation of the CHAT-AD, the study team will partner with a medical and surgical units&#xD;
      that are part of a large academic medical system to recruit 128 eligible care partners of&#xD;
      hospitalized patients living with ADRD, randomized into either the CHAT-AD plus usual care or&#xD;
      usual care-only groups. The team will assess feasibility by examining overall recruitment,&#xD;
      attrition, safety, adherence, and implementation satisfaction. To examine efficacy, a&#xD;
      validated measure of caregiving preparedness will be obtained pre- and post-intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Preparedness for Caregiving</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 72 hours post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Preparedness for Caregiving Scale, which is a self-rated assessment that consists of eight items that asks care partners how well prepared they believe they are for multiple domains of caregiving, change in preparedness will be measured. Preparedness is defined as perceived readiness for multiple domains of the caregiving role such as providing physical care, providing emotional support, setting up in-home support services, and dealing with the stress of caregiving. Responses are rated on a 5-point scale with scores ranging from 0 (not at all prepared) to 4 (very well prepared). The scale is scored by calculating the mean of all items answered with a score range of 0 to 4. The higher the score the more prepared the care partner feels for caregiving.</description>

    <description>The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) is a 29-item survey that asks discharged patients about their recent hospital stay. The study team will modify and use three items from this survey to capture care partner satisfaction of care. These items are rated on a 4-point case from 1 (definitely no or strongly disagree) to 4 (definitely yes or strongly agree), with higher scores representing more care partner satisfaction with care.</description>
