  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By doing this study, researchers hope to learn to see if there is relationship between whole&#xD;
      egg consumption and brain choline status. Additionally, researchers also plan to see if there&#xD;
      is a relationship between brain choline status and cognition.&#xD;

      Participants will come to the research center for 2 different visits. Visit 1 will include&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements, surveys, and a cognitive test. Approximately 7-10 days after&#xD;
      visit 1, participants will come back to the research center for visit 2. At visit 2,&#xD;
      participants will return surveys and a MRI scan will be performed to measure brain choline&#xD;
      status. Potential participants need to be located within the Kansas City metro area.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will recruit a variety of whole egg consumers. Egg consumption will be validated with a 7-day food record 1 week before the MRI. Cerebral choline levels are measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)</description>

        Participants will be recruited from the greater Kansas City. Recruitment for this research&#xD;
        opportunity by email, community flyers, and through the social media platform, Nextdoor.&#xD;
        Researchers will also use recruitment databases including the Recruitment and Eligibility&#xD;
        Database hosted by the KU Alzheimer's Disease Center (P30 AG035982) and the Pioneers&#xD;
        Participant Registry hosted by KU Medical Center and the University of Kansas Hospital.&#xD;
        Both of these registries consist of highly characterized, community-dwelling individuals&#xD;
        that have given prior consent to be directly contacted for research opportunities.&#xD;
