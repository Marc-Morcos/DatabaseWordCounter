  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent meta-analysis that included over 29.000 individuals found that the odds ratio (OR)&#xD;
      of individuals with high brain reserve compared to low was 0.54 (p &lt; 0.0001), a risk decrease&#xD;
      of 46%. Among the factors that influence cognitive reserve, mentally stimulating activities&#xD;
      was the most robust factor after controlling for education, age, occupation and other&#xD;
      potential confounds. The brain reserve effect was sustained over a median longitudinal&#xD;
      follow-up of 7 years. It would be interesting to detect whether a complex cognitive training&#xD;
      could show similar effects on the cognitive abilities of patients with mild Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as it has been reported in previous studies&#xD;
      based on mentally stimulating activities analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a complex cognitive training alters the neural networks in both&#xD;
      subject groups and this alteration is associated with improvement or stabilization of&#xD;
      cognitive and non-cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will perform a complex cognitive training program. Twenty patients with mild&#xD;
      AD and twenty four patients with MCI will be recruited in this study. The patients will be&#xD;
      randomised in control- and treatment groups.Additionally indirect effects on non-cognitive&#xD;
      functions will be evaluated in caregivers of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the cognitive and non-cognitive abilities will be changed&#xD;
      during the cognitive training. The investigators also expect differences between treatment&#xD;
      and control groups.&#xD;
