  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High body fat at midlife, as evidenced by overweight or obese body mass index (BMI), is&#xD;
      increasingly understood as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. However, the underlying&#xD;
      processes and mechanisms that may underlie this risk remains unknown. With this project, the&#xD;
      Investigator proposes to create a new cohort of cognitively normal 120 midlife individuals,&#xD;
      age 40-60 years. The investigator and research staff will characterize the participant's&#xD;
      overweight or obese status using metabolic tests including, an oral glucose tolerance test,&#xD;
      fasting plasma insulin, fasting plasma glucose, and hemoglobin A1c measurements. This testing&#xD;
      will generate categories of metabolically abnormal overweight and obese (MAOO), metabolically&#xD;
      normal overweight and obese (MNOO), and metabolically normal lean participants (MNLP).&#xD;
      Research staff will evaluate differences between these groups on neuroimaging with the newer&#xD;
      classification framework of Alzheimer's biomarkers with amyloid (A), tau (T), and&#xD;
      neurodegeneration (N), or ATN. Neurodegeneration will be assessed by atrophy on brain MRI as&#xD;
      reflected by regional volumes on Freesurfer. Staff will also evaluate MR neuroimaging markers&#xD;
      for neuroinflammation using a newer method called diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI),&#xD;
      developed at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University in St. Louis in&#xD;
      collaboration with The Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center&#xD;
      (Knight ADRC).&#xD;

        We currently have IRB-approved protocols covering ongoing imaging that meet the eligibility&#xD;
        criteria. The Washington University Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the&#xD;
        Center for Human Nutrition will refer participants . The Knight ADRC primarily recruits&#xD;
        participants by means of word of mouth and public service announcements from the greater&#xD;
        metropolitan St. Louis area. We will also coordinate these efforts with the Center for&#xD;
        Human Nutrition to maximize potential participants from their studies. The Center for Human&#xD;
        Nutrition has a long history (&gt;30 years) of recruitment for research studies and has a&#xD;
        large pool (&gt;20,000) of pre-screened adults. A small percentage (~17%) of participants are&#xD;
        referred by Washington University physicians. The Research Participant Registry/Volunteer&#xD;
        for Health (VFH) Program at Washington University in St. Louis (https://vfh.wustl.edu) will&#xD;
        also be utilized.&#xD;
