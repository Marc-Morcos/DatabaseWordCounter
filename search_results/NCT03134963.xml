    <textblock>
      850,000 people live with dementia in the UK, with that number expected to rise to more than 1&#xD;
      million within the next 5 years. The most common type of dementia (55%) is Alzheimer's&#xD;
      dementia, and vascular dementia is the second commonest type (15%). Mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (MCI) affects up to 20% of older adults and describes a set of symptoms rather than a&#xD;
      specific medical condition or disease. A person with MCI has subtle problems with one or more&#xD;
      of the following: day-to-day memory, concentrating, planning or organising, language (eg&#xD;
      struggling to find the right word), and judging distances and seeing objects properly.&#xD;
      Although MCI significantly increases the risk of developing dementia (by up to 5 times), at&#xD;
      present it is not possible to accurately predict which patients with MCI will progress to&#xD;
      dementia. In recent times there has been an increasing awareness that problems with brain&#xD;
      blood flow may contribute to the development, or progression, of dementia. Tests of mental&#xD;
      abilities, with standardised questions and pen-and-paper tests are a key component of the&#xD;
      formal diagnosis of dementia, yet little is known of the effects of these tests on brain&#xD;
      blood flow. Brain blood flow can be can be assessed non-invasively by the use of Trans&#xD;
      Cranial Doppler (TCD). This means using ultrasound probes over both sides of the head to&#xD;
      measure changes in blood flow in one of the main brain arteries (the middle cerebral artery).&#xD;
      This proposed study will therefore use TCD to evaluate changes in brain blood flow during&#xD;
      performance of the Addenbrooke's-III (ACE-III) cognitive assessment in four key groups of&#xD;
      patients, specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Healthy older adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with vascular dementia&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients with Alzheimer's dementia&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dementia is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the United Kingdom (UK); 850,000&#xD;
      people currently live with dementia in the UK, and that number is expected to rise to more&#xD;
      than 1 million within the next 5 years. The annual cost to the UK of dementia is £23.6&#xD;
      billion. The most common type of dementia in the population (55%) is Alzheimer's dementia&#xD;
      (AlzD). AlzD typically has a gradual onset and a slow progression. Vascular dementia (VascD)&#xD;
      is the second commonest form of dementia (15%), and is suggested by the presence of vascular&#xD;
      risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking and heart disease. The&#xD;
      onset of vascular dementia is often abrupt, and the progression stepwise and irregular;&#xD;
      cognitive deficits are often less uniform than those of Alzheimer's dementia. Mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (MCI) affects up to 20% of older adults and describes a set of symptoms rather&#xD;
      than a specific medical condition or disease. A person with MCI has subtle problems with one&#xD;
      or more of the following: day-to-day memory, planning, language, attention and visuospatial&#xD;
      skills. Although MCI significantly increases the risk of developing dementia at present it is&#xD;
      not possible to accurately predict which patients with MCI will progress to dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent times, our knowledge regarding the mechanisms of dementia development has changed&#xD;
      considerably. In contrast to previous thoughts, there is now a growing understanding that&#xD;
      problems with blood vessels (vascular dysfunction) and brain blood flow (cerebral&#xD;
      haemodynamics) are present in AlzD as well as in VascD. Research studies investigating the&#xD;
      vascular contributions to dementia generally report low blood flow (cerebral hypoperfusion).&#xD;
      It is thought that this hypoperfusion affects cellular health which in turn triggers&#xD;
      neurodegenerative pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain blood flow is directly linked to brain activity, a concept known as 'neurovascular&#xD;
      coupling'. Brain activation can be achieved through various cognitive and visual tasks (e.g&#xD;
      reading and writing), and also by sensorimotor tasks (e.g. movement or touch). Cognitive&#xD;
      assessments are routinely used in the diagnosis of dementia. Brain blood flow can be studied&#xD;
      using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). However, these&#xD;
      techniques are expensive, in the case of SPECT involve radiation, and there are feasibility&#xD;
      issues which are particularly problematic for older populations, including the need to lie&#xD;
      still for prolonged periods and have no metal implants. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound&#xD;
      is a simple, non-invasive imaging technique which allows for the continuous and bilateral&#xD;
      recording of brain blood flow velocity through the major arteries in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive testing with standardised assessment tools such as the Mini Mental State&#xD;
      Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Addenbrooke's-III Cognitive Examination&#xD;
      (ACE-III) is a key component of the formal diagnosis of dementia, yet the effects of these&#xD;
      tests on brain blood flow and haemodynamics is unknown. The ACE-III is a widely used,&#xD;
      validated, cognitive screening tool recommended for use by health practitioners and&#xD;
      researchers in patients over 50 years old with suspected dementia. The ACE-III is available&#xD;
      for free. The copyright is held by Professor John Hodges, ARC Federation Fellow and Professor&#xD;
      of Cognitive Neurology at Neuroscience Research Australia, who is happy for the test to be&#xD;
      used in clinical practice and research projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol has been used successfully by this group to examine changes in CBFv in 40&#xD;
      healthy volunteers from the University of Leicester. The data from this analysis has been&#xD;
      presented at an international conference and is currently undergoing peer review for&#xD;
      publication. Therefore, this protocol has demonstrated feasibility in a healthy population&#xD;
      and warrants further investigation for the utility in a patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will therefore use transcranial Doppler ultrasound to study the brain blood&#xD;
      flow responses of healthy controls, patients with AlzD, patients with VascD, and patients&#xD;
      with MCI, in response to performance of the ACE-III cognitive examination.&#xD;
