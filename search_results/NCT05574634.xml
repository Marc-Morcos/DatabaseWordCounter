  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of research has highlighted the importance of frontal regions, at both the&#xD;
      functional and structural levels, in age-related declines in attentional and cognitive&#xD;
      processing. However, the underlying neurobiological pathophysiological changes in the brain&#xD;
      that contribute to these declines are still largely unclear. The objective of this proposal&#xD;
      is to investigate neural mechanisms of age-related attentional distractibility, focusing on&#xD;
      the neural circuit initiated from the locus coeruleus (LC). In the current proposal, the&#xD;
      investigators will test the hypothesis that the neural dysconnectivity of LC with the&#xD;
      salience network (SN) drives failures of ignoring distractors in older adults. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine how LC-SN connectivity is associated with selective attention&#xD;
      performance, and how improved LC-SN connectivity through a cognitive training program may&#xD;
      lead to improved attentional performance.&#xD;

    <description>During this task, participants will be presented to with target place stimuli overlaid on nonexpressive faces) and be asked to identify categories of place images ('building' to 'house') selectively as soon as possible while ignoring overlapped faces. The investigators will also include place only images to measure participants' baseline neural activation when there is no distractor. Each image condition will be presented in a mixed event related design that includes 15 blocks for each condition as a function of image type (overlaid vs. place-only). The block order will be counterbalanced and each block will be separated by a 10-s blank screen.</description>

    <description>An adaptive at-home tablet-based program that includes variants of the Flanker Task, the Stroop Task, and a Visual Tracking Task. Each session of practice will include up to ten minutes with each of these task types, and the tasks will increase in difficulty in a way that further taxes attention (such as through more distractors or more incongruent trials) as participant performance improves.</description>
