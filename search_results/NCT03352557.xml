  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the placebo-controlled period is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of BIIB092 in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) or with mild AD. The secondary objectives of the placebo-controlled&#xD;
      period are to evaluate the efficacy of multiple doses of BIIB092 in slowing cognitive and&#xD;
      functional impairment in participants with MCI due to AD or with mild AD, and to evaluate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of BIIB092 after multiple doses in participants with MCI due to AD or with&#xD;
      mild AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the long-term extension period is to evaluate the long-term safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of BIIB092 in participants with MCI due to AD or with mild AD.&#xD;

    <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in participant or clinical investigation participant administered pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have causal relationship with this treatment. AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to medicinal (investigational) product. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose, results in death; in view of investigator places participant at immediate risk of death; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; is medically important event. Participants who completed treatment period in PC period and did not enter LTE period were to be assessed at Week 90 (14 weeks after end of treatment) as safety follow-up.</description>

    <measure>PC Period: Change From Baseline Over Time at Week 78 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 78</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR-SB is a validated clinical assessment of global function in participants with AD. The CDR is comprised of 6 domains: Memory, Orientation, Judgment and Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home and Hobbies, and Personal Care. CDR-SB is the sum of the scores for these 6 domains. Impairment is scored in each of 6 cognitive categories on a scale in which none = 0, questionable = 0.5, mild = 1, moderate = 2, and severe = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or &quot;box scores&quot;, can be added together to give the CDR-SB score which ranges from 0 (none) to 18 (severe impairment).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled at approximately 100 investigational sites from 03 May 2018 to 30 August 2021.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 654 participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) were enrolled and randomized to receive placebo or BIIB092 125/375/600/2000 milligrams(mg) in Placebo-Controlled (PC) period. Following PC period, 521 participants entered and 516 were dosed in Long-term Extension (LTE) period, and no participants completed the study due to early termination of the study.

        <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in participant or clinical investigation participant administered pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have causal relationship with this treatment. AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to medicinal (investigational) product. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose, results in death; in view of investigator places participant at immediate risk of death; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; is medically important event. Participants who completed treatment period in PC period and did not enter LTE period were to be assessed at Week 90 (14 weeks after end of treatment) as safety follow-up.</description>

          <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose, results in death; in the view of the investigator places the participant at immediate risk of death; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; is a medically important event.</description>

        <description>The CDR-SB is a validated clinical assessment of global function in participants with AD. The CDR is comprised of 6 domains: Memory, Orientation, Judgment and Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home and Hobbies, and Personal Care. CDR-SB is the sum of the scores for these 6 domains. Impairment is scored in each of 6 cognitive categories on a scale in which none = 0, questionable = 0.5, mild = 1, moderate = 2, and severe = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or &quot;box scores&quot;, can be added together to give the CDR-SB score which ranges from 0 (none) to 18 (severe impairment).</description>
