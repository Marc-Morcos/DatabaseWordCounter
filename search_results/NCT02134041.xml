  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are extending the researches of Taiwan neurosurgery traumatic brain injury (TBI) database&#xD;
      which is led by Professor WT Chiu in Taipei Medical University and will recruit mild TBI&#xD;
      (mTBI) participants who have ever been registered in the database. This database has been&#xD;
      established for over 15 years and contains the information of over 150000 patients. It is one&#xD;
      of the largest TBI database in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TBI usually results from traffic accidents, falls or violence events. Most of the victims are&#xD;
      young people and the victims suffer from life-threatening and mental-physical deficits. Mild&#xD;
      TBI (mTBI) usually was neglected before because its symptoms, signs are mild and mTBI&#xD;
      patients usually were not obtained enough initial treatment. Therefore, mTBI might result in&#xD;
      long-term cognitive and affective impairments, such as depression, indifference, anxiety,&#xD;
      memory impairment, loss of attention and executive function. These late effects not only&#xD;
      decrease the life quality of patients and their family but also increase the social and&#xD;
      medical burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent epidemiology studies have pointed out that TBI would increase the risk for dementia,&#xD;
      especially Alzheimer disease (AD) by 2-4 times. However, the association between TBI&#xD;
      severity, number of repeats, genetic factors and onset of AD remains further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the pathological hallmarks for AD.&#xD;
      Accumulation of Aβ is considered to be the first step of pathophysilogy of AD. Compelling&#xD;
      researches have supported TBI accelerates the formation and accumulation of Aβ. These&#xD;
      findings could link TBI with AD but the previous researches had limitations. There was lack&#xD;
      of mTBI pathology data so the impacts of mTBI on Aβ accumulation were still obscure. By&#xD;
      amyloid-PET, we could study the effects of mTBI on the accumulation of Aβ and this tool could&#xD;
      be helpful for understanding the real impacts and pathophysiological mechanisms of mTBI on&#xD;
      AD.&#xD;

      We will conduct amyloid PET, cognitive examination and APOE genotyping for the individuals&#xD;
      who had traumatic brain injury (TBI) in 1 year, 5 years, 10 years and 15 years ago.&#xD;
      Age-gender-matched controls without TBI will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of TBI on amyloid accumulation in the&#xD;
      brain. In the mean time, we also will test the effects of APOE genotypes in amyloid&#xD;
      accumulation after TBI and the clinical relevants, in terms of cognitive function.&#xD;
