  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Trial-Ready Cohort - Down Syndrome (TRC-DS) is to enroll 120 non-demented&#xD;
      adults (ages 35-55) with Down syndrome (DS) into a trial ready cohort (TRC). Participants&#xD;
      enrolled in the TRC-DS will undergo longitudinal cognitive and clinical assessment, genetic&#xD;
      and biomarker testing, as well as imaging and biospecimen collection. Using these outcome&#xD;
      measures, researchers will analyze the relationships between cognitive measures and&#xD;
      biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to identify endpoints for AD clinical trials in DS&#xD;
      that best reflect disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRC-DS is collaborating with the Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome&#xD;
      (ABC-DS) to allow study participants to be concurrently enrolled in both ABC-DS and TRC-DS,&#xD;
      referred to as &quot;co-enrollment&quot;. ABC-DS is a longitudinal, observational research study that&#xD;
      is overseen at University of Pittsburgh Coordinating Center. ABC-DS participants who express&#xD;
      interest in potentially joining a clinical trial in the future and who meet TRC-DS&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, may choose to co-enroll in TRC-DS at an ABC-DS Site. Co-enrolled&#xD;
      participants will adhere to the ABC-DS protocol and schedule of activities, but agree to&#xD;
      share their data with the TRC-DS team and to receive invitations for future participation in&#xD;
      clinical trials. Fore more information on ABC-DS please visit&#xD;
      https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/abc-ds or http://abcds.pitt.edu/.&#xD;

    <measure>Enrollment of 120 participants into the Trial-Ready Cohort in DS (TRC-DS).</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary aim of the TRC-DS is enrollment of 120 participants into the trial ready cohort to support future referral and enrollment into primary Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention trials for adults with DS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognition as measured by the Cued Recall Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 16, or until enrollment into a clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>The Cued Recall Test is modified from a version developed for adults from the typical population. Twelve items are presented for learning, 4 at a time, with each item accompanied by a unique category cue. The testing phase consists of 3 trials. Each trial begins with free recall of the test items; following free recall, a category cue is provided for those items not spontaneously recalled. Two scores are generated from the test, a Free Recall Score and a Total Score (Free Recall plus items recalled when the category cue is provided). A cut-off of &lt; 23 on the Total Score resulted in a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 84% when individuals with DS and a diagnosis of dementia were compared to their healthy peers without dementia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in behavior as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening and Month 16, or until enrollment into a clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a well-validated, reliable, multi-item instrument to assess psychopathology in AD based on an interview with a caregiver or qualified study partner. It evaluates both the frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric features including delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behavior, sleep, and appetite and eating disorders. A higher NPI score means that the participant is displaying more behavioral symptoms. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum is 144. A score of 0-20 is mild, 20-50 moderate and greater than 50 means significant behavioral symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognition as measured by the Down Syndrome Mental Status Exam (DSMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening and Month 16, or until enrollment into a clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>The DSMSE is an omnibus measure of neuropsychological function that assesses a broad range of skills and is easy to administer. It is divided into items that test recall for personal information, orientation to season and day of week, memory, language, visuospatial function, and praxis. Recall for personal information is tested with questions about the subject's name, age and birth date. Orientation items ask the day of the week and season of the year. Memory in the DSMSE is assessed with items that require immediate and delayed recall of three objects and for the location of three hidden objects. Language items include confrontation naming, sentence repetition, and comprehension of one, two, and three step commands. Visuospatial items are three-dimensional block constructions. Praxis items include transitive and intransitive limb movements and a sequential task.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in behavior as measured by the Vineland 3 (Informant Version)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 16, or until enrollment into a clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale 3 (VABS-II) I is a normed assessment tool that assesses adaptive behavior across the areas of communication, activities of daily living, and socialization. The tool is self-administered via interview toby a study partner using a tablet (e.g. iPad), takes approximately 45 minutes to complete and may be done remotely.&#xD;
The VABS-III scores range from 20-140. Higher scores indicate higher functioning. Specifically, these include 'very high' (domain and Adaptive Behavior Scale (ABC) Standard Scores of 130-140), &quot;moderately high&quot; (domain and ABC Standard Scores of 115-129), &quot;adequate&quot; (domain and ABC Standard Scores of 86-114), &quot;moderately low&quot; (domain and ABC Standard Scores of 71-85), and &quot;low&quot; (domain and ABC Standard Scores of 20-70).</description>

    <measure>Change in cognition as measured by the National Task Group Early Detection Screen for Dementia (NTG-EDSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 16, or until enrollment into a clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>The National Task Group Early Detection Screen for Dementia (NTG-EDSD) is a screening tool which measures changes typically observed in dementia. It is composed of four primary sections about relative demographics, ratings of health, mental health, and life stressors, a review of multiple domains associated with adult functioning, and a review of chronic medical conditions. The NTG-EDSD is completed by a staff member who interviews the caregiver. It contains 40 questions/question groups and takes 15 mins to administer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognition as measured by the Stroop Dog and Cat Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 16, or until enrollment into a clinical trial</time_frame>
    <description>In the Stroop Dog and Cat Task, a linear sequence of 16 pictures (8 cats, 8 dogs) are presented in a pre-determined random order. In the control condition the subject says the name of each picture and is urged to do so rapidly. In the experimental (inhibition) condition the participant is required to say 'cat' for the picture of each dog and 'dog' for the cat. For each condition the participant is given a brief practice period. Performance on the Stroop Dog and Cat was significantly related to informant-reported memory changes in 103 adults with DS with mild-moderate intellectual disability in the age range of 36 - 72 years.</description>
