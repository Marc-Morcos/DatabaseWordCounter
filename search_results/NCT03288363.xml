      TDCS is a rapidly expanding technique, used to treat cognitive difficulties associated with&#xD;
      many pathologies (Parkinson's disease, rehabilitation after head trauma, etc.), but which&#xD;
      remains of the field of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its use remains very experimental, and concerns the exploration of cognitions, in healthy and&#xD;
      diseased subjects. There are not many studies on the elderly subject with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, nor do they document the medium- and long-term effect (more than one month), nor the&#xD;
      effect on geriatric parameters such as Fragility indices and the risk of falls, especially at&#xD;
      home. These characteristics are decisive because they define the level of autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore wish to study the effect of a 2-week treatment with tDCS (tDCS&#xD;
      active) versus placebo (2-week tDCS group) for a three-month period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease and related syndromes have become a major public health priority issue in&#xD;
      France. Pharmacological treatments are ineffective and symptomatic, and only delay the&#xD;
      progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of Alzheimer's disease involves the development of multi-domain prevention&#xD;
      programs, including physical activity and neurostimulation by cognitive stimulation. They aim&#xD;
      to delay the appearance of fragility defined according to Fried by difficulties in walking,&#xD;
      weight loss, fatigue, lack of wrist strength and sedentary lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a stimulation technique using a low&#xD;
      intensity DC electric current that acts by modulating neuronal excitability at the cerebral&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to recent data, by its action on the cerebral cortex, this simple and non-invasive&#xD;
      stimulation technique could prevent the effects of pathological aging, and reduce the&#xD;
      cognitive difficulties of the elderly concerning episodic memory, attention and executive&#xD;
      functions. These difficulties are also factors related to the risk of the elderly falling&#xD;
      (defined by the slowness of walking speed, reduced monopodal support time and the existence&#xD;
      of a falling antecedent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TDCS is a rapidly expanding technique, used to treat cognitive difficulties associated with&#xD;
      many pathologies (Parkinson's disease, rehabilitation after head trauma, etc.), but which&#xD;
      remains of the field of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its use remains very experimental, and concerns the exploration of cognitions, in healthy and&#xD;
      diseased subjects. There are not many studies on the elderly subject with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, nor do they document the medium- and long-term effect (more than one month), nor the&#xD;
      effect on geriatric parameters such as Fragility indices and the risk of falls, especially at&#xD;
      home. These characteristics are decisive because they define the level of autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore wish to study the effect of a 2-week treatment with tDCS (tDCS&#xD;
      active) versus placebo (2-week tDCS group) on these criteria. This effect may stop or curb&#xD;
      cognitive decline.&#xD;
