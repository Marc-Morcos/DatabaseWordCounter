  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I clinical trial is the first step in testing gene therapy. This study is called a&#xD;
      &quot;Safety/Toxicity&quot; study by the Food and Drug Administration, and primarily aims to determine&#xD;
      whether the experimental protocol is safe for humans. It will determine whether the study&#xD;
      procedure causes side effects in humans, and may also give us a preliminary sense of whether&#xD;
      this will be effective in combating Alzheimer's disease in humans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the precise pathogenesis of AD is unknown, certain pathological features accompany&#xD;
      the disease. These pathological features include the abnormal accumulation of extracellular&#xD;
      amyloid, the formation of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, synapse loss, and cellular&#xD;
      degeneration. Cellular degeneration occurs in several neuronal populations in the central&#xD;
      nervous system. Among the neuronal populations that degenerate in AD, loss of basal forebrain&#xD;
      cholinergic neurons is particularly severe. Loss of cholinergic neurons in AD correlates best&#xD;
      with severity of dementia, the density of amyloid plaques in the brain, and the amount of&#xD;
      synapse. To date, the only FDA-approved therapies for Alzheimer's Disease focus on augmenting&#xD;
      the function of degenerating cholinergic neurons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present trial will move beyond compensating for cholinergic neuronal degeneration by&#xD;
      attempting to 1) protect cholinergic neurons from degeneration, and 2) augment the function&#xD;
      of remaining cholinergic neurons by directly elevating choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)&#xD;
      function in neurons. These two therapeutic interventions will be brought about by the&#xD;
      delivery of human NGF to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NGF has been shown to prevent both lesion-induced and spontaneous, age-related degeneration&#xD;
      of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. Further, NGF infusions reversed both lesion-induced&#xD;
      memory loss and spontaneous, age-related memory loss in rodents. Based on these findings, NGF&#xD;
      administration offers significant potential as a neuroprotective strategy in Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grafts of primary fibroblasts transduced to express human nerve growth factor have been shown&#xD;
      to sustain NGF in vivo gene expression for at least eighteen months in the rodent central&#xD;
      nervous system. In addition, these grafts sustain NGF messenger RNA production for at least&#xD;
      14 months in vivo. In primate systems, ex vivo NGF gene therapy has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      sustain NGF protein production in the brain in the rhesus money for at least one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the available data suggests that ex vivo NGF gene therapy is an effective means of&#xD;
      preventing loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and of augmenting cholinergic function&#xD;
      in the primate brain. In animals, this procedure is safe and well tolerated. Based on these&#xD;
      data, clinical trials of ex vivo NGF gene therapy in Alzheimer's disease has begun.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an 18 month, open label, prospective Phase I clinical trial of Ex Vivo Gene Therapy&#xD;
      for Alzheimer's disease in 8 patients with a mild degree of cognitive impairment. Patients&#xD;
      will be screened for the diagnosis of Probable Alzheimer's disease of mild severity. After&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent, three skin biopsies will be obtained to generate cultures of&#xD;
      primary, autologous fibroblasts. These cells will be cultured, then genetically modified to&#xD;
      produce and secrete the human nerve growth factor (NGF) molecule. If fibroblasts are deemed&#xD;
      acceptable based on NGF production rates and standard cell culture sterility tests, then&#xD;
      patients will receive intracerebral injections of their own primary fibroblasts into the&#xD;
      region of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the brain, where neurons are undergoing&#xD;
      atrophy as a result of Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
