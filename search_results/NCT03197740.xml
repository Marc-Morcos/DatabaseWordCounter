    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of donepezil transdermal&#xD;
      patch in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the test drug, IPI-301&#xD;
      (donepezil transdermal patch), to the comparator, Aricept tablet, after 24 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease in terms of improvement in cognitive&#xD;
      function as assessed by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-cog) and&#xD;
      in terms of global assessment as assessed by Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change&#xD;
      plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus).&#xD;
