  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) (such as aggression, restlessness,&#xD;
      agitation, wandering, anxiety, depression) are common to most people with dementia at some&#xD;
      point during their illness and represent an aspect of dementia particularly difficult to&#xD;
      manage. There is growing attention to the therapeutic effects of natural environments on&#xD;
      people's health. Exposure to natural environments (seeing greenery, hearing outside natural&#xD;
      sounds) has been shown to enhance wellbeing, reduce depression, anxiety and stress levels,&#xD;
      and decrease hospital length-of-stay for inpatients. Virtual Reality (VR) is a novel&#xD;
      technology that uses a Head Mounted Display (HMD) to generate simulated immersive experiences&#xD;
      that elicit perceptions and behaviors similar to those in real life and can make one feel as&#xD;
      though they are truly present in another place. Based on scientific research, previous&#xD;
      studies, and expert consultation, we created a library of VR experiences depicting calming&#xD;
      nature scenes designed specifically for people with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this RCT are 1) to evaluate the effects of VR-therapy on BPSD and the&#xD;
      hospital care experience of in-patients with dementia and/or delirium admitted to an acute&#xD;
      care hospital, 2) to determine the usability, tolerability, and safety of VR-therapy for&#xD;
      patients with dementia and/or delirium admitted to acute care, 3) determine the effect of&#xD;
      VR-therapy on quality of life for patients with dementia and/or delirium admitted to acute&#xD;
      care and 4) to explore a framework for introducing non-pharmacological therapies in acute&#xD;
      care hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are 1) VR-therapy helps manage BPSD (e.g. decrease anxiety, aggression,&#xD;
      depression, violent behaviors, incidents of wandering), and may decrease the amount and/or&#xD;
      frequency of sedatives and anti-depressant medication administered and/or the number of&#xD;
      incidents that require restraints, and the number of falls, in people with dementia and/or&#xD;
      delirium admitted to an acute care hospital. 2) VR-therapy will improve the quality of life&#xD;
      for individuals with dementia and/or delirium admitted to an acute care hospital&#xD;
      (operationalized through conducting a validated instrument to measure quality of life for&#xD;
      people with dementia). 3) VR-therapy is safe and feasible to administer to individuals with&#xD;
      dementia and/or delirium admitted to an acute care hospital (with assistance from their&#xD;
      circle of care members and/or caregivers).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) (including hallucinations,&#xD;
      delusions, aggression, restlessness, agitation, wandering, anxiety, depression, elation,&#xD;
      euphoria, disinhibition, motor disturbances, nighttime behaviours, and appetite disturbances)&#xD;
      represent an aspect of dementia particularly difficult to manage for which new treatments are&#xD;
      urgently needed. Current means to manage BPSD typically involve medications (e.g.&#xD;
      anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, sedatives) associated with negative side effects such as&#xD;
      lethargy, loss-of-self, cognitive decline, and increased risk of falls, and/or applying&#xD;
      physical barriers and restraints (alarms, locks, Buxton chairs, tethers) that can cause&#xD;
      pressure sores, injury, infection, as well as negative psychological effects such as anxiety,&#xD;
      distress, and aggression. Although options for non-pharmacological management of BPSD in&#xD;
      acute care exist (e.g. reminiscence therapy, therapeutic touch, music therapy), they are&#xD;
      seldom implemented in practice due to lack of time, resources, and/or training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to natural environments (seeing greenery, hearing outside natural sounds) has been&#xD;
      shown to enhance wellbeing, reduce depression, anxiety, and stress levels, and decrease&#xD;
      hospital length-of-stay for inpatients. Through VR technology, one's surroundings can be&#xD;
      seamlessly replaced by a virtual world of their choosing. Based on previous studies and&#xD;
      expert consultation, we created a library of VR experiences depicting calming nature scenes&#xD;
      (peaceful lake, refreshing forest, cheerful playground) designed specifically for people with&#xD;
      dementia, as a prototype for introducing immersive VR-therapy to hospitals, long term care&#xD;
      facilities and private homes. The goal of VR-therapy is to help manage BPSD and stimulate&#xD;
      psychological/cognitive health and daytime engagement for people with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT will be informed by our prior pilot study conducted in the hospitalist medicine&#xD;
      department of Michael Garron Hospital with inpatients with dementia to validate the proposed&#xD;
      RCT study protocol (processes, methods, recruitment strategy, resource requirements,&#xD;
      timelines) as well as by previous feasibility studies in outpatients that showed it is safe&#xD;
      and feasible to use VR/HMDs for people with dementia.&#xD;

    <description>Wearing a Virtual Reality head mounted device allows the user to become immersed in a virtual environment. We have assembled a library of 3-10 minute 360-degree films from a variety of nature settings. The VR films were intentionally chosen to be calming in distinctive ways, as supported by the literature around nature visualization and wellbeing. By varying 1) the lengths of the films (3, 5, and 10 minutes), 2) the types of natural elements (greenery, earth, sky, water), 3) distance of view (close-ups, vistas), 4) motion (flowing water, wind in trees), 5) sound, and 6) presence of different elements (humans/animals, scenery, urban sites, etc.), the content provides a wide range of attributes that can be collaboratively selected by the individual, caregiver, or health care provider for each individual. We will display these films on commercially available VR equipment and will provide audio matching the film using commercially available headphones.</description>
