  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are serious, life limiting illnesses with no&#xD;
      known cure. Dementia is the fifth-leading cause of death in older adults and the majority of&#xD;
      people with advanced dementia die in nursing homes (NHs). Miller et al reported that 40% of&#xD;
      U.S. NH residents dying with advanced dementia received Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) care&#xD;
      in the last 90 days of life, and receipt of this care was associated significantly with&#xD;
      poorer end-of-life outcomes, including a higher risk of dying in a hospital, compared to&#xD;
      decedents with no SNF care. SNF care is a Medicare post-acute rehabilitation service&#xD;
      delivered in NHs focused on intense rehabilitation and/or aggressive, disease-modifying&#xD;
      therapies. Regardless of life expectancy, use of SNF care precludes access to Hospice&#xD;
      services. Palliative care (PC) offers an evidence-based alternative.&#xD;

      In this pragmatic clinical trial, broadcast notification will be utilized to inform all newly&#xD;
      admitted patients at each study site of their participation in this trial. During the&#xD;
      admission process, potential subjects will be provided with a 1-page summary sheet (Broadcast&#xD;
      notification) detailing their participation in this study that will include contact&#xD;
      information for the study team, should the subject or their LAR/surrogate decision maker&#xD;
      elect to opt-out of participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be collected virtually via telephone by asking each newly admitted patient&#xD;
      or their surrogate to complete the Patient Outcomes Scale (POSv2), the Satisfaction With Care&#xD;
      at the End of Life in Dementia (SWC-EOLD), and the Symptom Management at the End of Life in&#xD;
      Dementia (SM-EOLD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 14 days and 21 days after the baseline POSv2, SW-EOLD, and the SM-EOLD are&#xD;
      administered, all subjects will be asked to complete the POSv2, SW-EOLD, and the SM-EOLD&#xD;
      again virtually via telephone. The POSv2, SW-EOLD, and the SM-EOLD will be given a total of&#xD;
      two times to those in the INTERVENTION and CONTROL groups; at baseline and follow up (14-21&#xD;
      days later).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deidentified subject demographics will be collected on all participants in the following way:&#xD;
      Study team members will review subject's medical records and enter de-identified data into a&#xD;
      Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database (Acts staff assists with the study team's&#xD;
      access to subject's medical record).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the intervention is to prevent, identify and treat symptoms early during SNF&#xD;
      care, establish goal directed treatment decisions, and support the patient and family in&#xD;
      decision making. The study team anticipates that many Palliative Care encounters involve a&#xD;
      single encounter with the patient and/or LAR/surrogate decision maker, but the study team has&#xD;
      made allowances for follow up visits depending on individual patient and family needs (e.g.,&#xD;
      symptom management, continuing goals of care discussions). Study team members will use usual&#xD;
      care as the control condition. Usual care consists of traditional resources focused on&#xD;
      skilled nursing care without services to support specialty palliative care. A usual care&#xD;
      comparison will test whether the Palliative Care Encounter improves patient/family reported&#xD;
      outcomes compared to traditional services. Study team members chosen to not use an attention&#xD;
      control condition because the goal of this pilot clinical trial is to assess feasibility and&#xD;
      determine the effect size of the intervention on the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study team members will collect measures via phone or through a secured online template to&#xD;
      minimize missing data at two time points (baseline &amp; 14-21 days later) during the study. All&#xD;
      data will be entered and managed in REDCap by the RA, project manager, or the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient/Caregiver Quality of Life: Baseline, follow-up (14-21 days later) measured by the&#xD;
      Palliative Outcomes Scale version 2 (POSv2), a 12-item survey that measures quality of life&#xD;
      in five dimensions: 1) physical; 2) emotional; 3) psychological; 4) spiritual needs, and 5)&#xD;
      provision of information and support. (RESEARCH PROCEDURE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfaction With Care at the End of Life in Dementia (SWC-EOLD). The SWC-EOLD is a&#xD;
      validated, 10-item scale that measures SDMs' satisfaction with care for persons with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease (PWAD). Each item is measured on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1&#xD;
      (&quot;strongly disagree&quot;) to 4 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;) and uses a &quot;prior 90 days&quot; timeframe. Specific&#xD;
      elements include satisfaction with medical and nursing care, decision-making, and their&#xD;
      understanding of the PWAD's illness. All items are summed, yielding a range of scores of&#xD;
      10-40. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction. (RESEARCH PROCEDURE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom Management at the End of Life in Dementia (SM-EOLD). The SM-EOLD is a valid and&#xD;
      reliable 9 item scale completed by a nurse that measures PWAD physical and psychological&#xD;
      symptoms over the previous 90 days. Each item is rated on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from&#xD;
      0 to 5 (0 = &quot;daily&quot;, 1 = &quot;several days a week&quot;, 2 = &quot;once per week&quot;, 3 = &quot;2 or 3 days a&#xD;
      month&quot;, 4 = &quot;once a month&quot;, 5 = &quot;never&quot;). Scores are summed and range from 0 to 45 (higher&#xD;
      scores indicate better symptom management). (RESEARCH PROCEDURE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palliative Care Encounter Trained provider will discuss illness trajectories, establish and&#xD;
      communicate patient-directed goals that guide health care decisions, identify and treat&#xD;
      illness-related symptoms, and identify psycho-spiritual needs and approaches to mitigate&#xD;
      suffering. (STANDARD OF CARE)&#xD;
