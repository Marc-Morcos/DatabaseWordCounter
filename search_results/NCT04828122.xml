  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether a set of algorithms analysing&#xD;
      acoustic and linguistic patterns of speech can detect amyloid-specific cognitive impairment&#xD;
      in early stage Alzheimer's disease, as measured by the AUC of the receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC) curve of the binary classifier distinguishing between amyloid positive&#xD;
      (Arms 1 and 3) and amyloid negative (Arms 2 and 4) Arms. Secondary objectives include (1)&#xD;
      evaluating whether similar algorithms can detect amyloid-specific cognitive impairment in the&#xD;
      cognitively normal (CN) and MCI Arms respectively, as measured on binary classifier&#xD;
      performance; (2) whether they can detect MCI, as measured on binary classifier performance&#xD;
      (AUC, sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa), and the agreement between the PACC5 composite&#xD;
      and the corresponding regression model predicting it in all Arms pooled (Wilcoxon signed-rank&#xD;
      test, CIA); (3) evaluating variables that can impact performance of such algorithms of&#xD;
      covariates from the speaker (age, gender, education level) and environment (measures of&#xD;
      acoustic quality).&#xD;

             negative Arms).&#xD;
