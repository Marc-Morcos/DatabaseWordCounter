    <textblock>
      Part 1 of this study will be conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of multiple doses of TB006, as well as the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose of TB006, and to assess the immunogenicity of TB006 (production of anti-TB006 antibody).&#xD;
      Part 2 of this study will be conducted to determine the clinical efficacy of TB006 in&#xD;
      participants with mild to severe Alzheimer's Disease.&#xD;
