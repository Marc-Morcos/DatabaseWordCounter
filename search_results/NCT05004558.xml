  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to study the effects of a 24-week remote-based resistance exercise&#xD;
      training program on cardiovascular disease risk factors, cognitive function, and quality of&#xD;
      life in older adults living with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's Disease and/or a&#xD;
      related dementia. Data for this study will be collected at the beginning, middle, and end of&#xD;
      the resistance training program. Participants of this study will receive a baseline&#xD;
      health-fitness assessment at the beginning of the study. Measurements of resting blood&#xD;
      pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipids, waist and hip circumferences, height and weight,&#xD;
      cognitive function and quality of life will be collected at the health-fitness assessment.&#xD;
      Participants will then receive supervised remote-based resistance exercise training with&#xD;
      Therabands, 3 days per week for 12 weeks before receiving a second 12-week health-fitness&#xD;
      assessment in the middle of the intervention. Participants will then receive 12 additional&#xD;
      weeks of supervised remote-based resistance exercise training with Therabands, 3 days per&#xD;
      week for 12 weeks before receiving a third 24-week health fitness assessment at the end of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

      The investigators aim to study the effects of a 24-week remote-based resistance exercise&#xD;
      training program on cardiovascular disease risk factors, cognitive function, and quality of&#xD;
      life in older adults living with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's Disease and/or a&#xD;
      related dementia. Data for this study will be collected at the beginning, middle, and end of&#xD;
      the resistance training program. Measurements of resting blood pressure will be collected&#xD;
      with an automated blood pressure monitor. Fasting blood glucose and lipids will be retrieved&#xD;
      from the electronic medical record or from a finger stick. Waist and hip circumferences will&#xD;
      be collected with a tape measure. Height and weight will be collected with a physician scale.&#xD;
      Cognitive function and quality of life will be collected from interviews using the Montreal&#xD;
      Cognitive Assessment and Short-Form (36) Health Survey. All data collected from this study&#xD;
      will be de-identified using the &quot;Safe-Harbor&quot; method, which minimizes exposure of personal&#xD;
      health information by providing each participant with a unique participant-ID and only&#xD;
      providing access to those who are listed and approved for access privileges. Data collected&#xD;
      for this study will also be stored on an encrypted and password- protected hard drive, and&#xD;
      data analyzed will be performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences using&#xD;
      analyses of covariance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When participants are enrolled in the study, he/she will be grouped on the basis of their&#xD;
      cognitive function status from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. All participants will then&#xD;
      receive supervised remote-based resistance exercise training with Therabands, 3 days per week&#xD;
      for 24 weeks. The risks of participating in exercise programs are minimal. Some of the&#xD;
      possible risks of participating in resistance exercise include becoming tired and/or&#xD;
      experiencing delayed onset muscle soreness, leg cramping, or muscle strain from performing&#xD;
      resistance exercise. There are several benefits from engaging in resistance exercise&#xD;
      programs. Participants of this study will receive health-fitness assessment at the beginning,&#xD;
      middle, and end of the study, and as such, will benefit from being made aware of their&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk factors, cognitive function, and quality of life. Other possible&#xD;
      benefits from participation in the resistance exercise program may include improvements in&#xD;
      muscular size and strength and/or activities of daily living.&#xD;
