  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is focused on determining whether biological signatures of target&#xD;
      engagement by a Centella asiatica water extract product administered orally for 6 weeks can&#xD;
      be measured in comparison to placebo. This study will also assess the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of the Centella asiatica water extract product.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of 48&#xD;
      participants to evaluate safety, tolerability, and biological signatures of target engagement&#xD;
      of brain neuronal viability, oxidative stress, and brain mitochondrial activity of a Centella&#xD;
      asiatica water extract product (CAP) in older adults aged 65-85 years with mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The intervention is taken orally daily for six&#xD;
      weeks and pre and post assessments will be collected.&#xD;

    <measure>Adverse events (AE) arising during, and up to 4 weeks after, 6 weeks on intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A standard multi-system questionnaire will record the type and severity (range 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life-threatening, 5 = fatal) of any adverse events. The Investigators will evaluate any changes in symptoms from baseline, and consider alternative clinical explanations, to determine if the changes are adverse events attributable to the study intervention. The investigators will determine the proportion of participants who report each type of adverse event following administration of CAP compared to placebo.</description>

    <measure>Oral temperature measured at study visits.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Oral temperature will be measured in degrees Celsius by means of a thermometer. Temperatures falling outside the normal range (33.2-38.2 degrees Celsius) will be compared to baseline levels, and alternative clinical explanations considered, in order to determine if they are attributable to the study intervention.

    <measure>Change from baseline in liver function after 6 weeks on intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>

Enzyme levels falling outside the normal range (0-35 Units per liter for alanine aminotransferase and 17-59 Units per liter for aspartate aminotransferase) will be compared to baseline levels, and alternative clinical explanations considered, in order to determine if elevations are attributable to the study intervention. The investigators will aggregate the measures by using an elevation in either enzyme function as a reflection of overall liver function.

Each parameter falling outside the normal range ( 0.5 to 1.2 milligrams per deciliter for creatinine and 7 to 20 milligrams per deciliter for blood urea nitrogen), will be compared to baseline values and alternative clinical explanations considered, in order to determine if elevations are attributable to the study intervention. The investigators will aggregate the measures by using an elevation in either blood urea nitrogen or creatinine as a reflection of overall kidney function. The investigators will also determine the proportion of all participants who develop abnormal laboratory values following administration of CAP compared to placebo.</description>
