    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of amyloid in the brain. Amyloid is a&#xD;
      protein found in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease and can be detected using a&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan. This study is interested in how amyloid levels in&#xD;
      the brain relate to memory and thinking abilities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to use 11C-PiB, a commonly used tracer that binds to&#xD;
      amyloid plaques in the brain, as a biological marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD) related&#xD;
      brain changes. Data from this PET-only study will be compared to and analyzed with data from&#xD;
      the Investigators' longitudinal biomarker studies, COMIRB #15-1774 and COMIRB #18-2607. This&#xD;
      enables investigators to examine how deposition of the amyloid protein relates to cognitive&#xD;
      aging in both symptomatic and asymptomatic older adults. It will assist investigators in&#xD;
      comparing rates of change in memory and thinking ability in healthy subjects who are amyloid&#xD;
      positive versus amyloid negative, as well as in comparing rates of conversion to a higher&#xD;
      level of impairment (e.g. such as Mild Cognitive Impairment converting to Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease) based on the quantitative analysis of amyloid burden. Moreover, by capitalizing on&#xD;
      data across the two studies, the investigators will be able to better understand the&#xD;
      relationship between amyloid deposition (as assessed by PET; current proposal) and other&#xD;
      biomarkers (as assessed in COMIRB #15-1774, COMIRB #18-2607), which ultimately may help the&#xD;
      investigators better predict the onset and progression of clinical AD symptoms. Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited solely from the longitudinal study (COMIRB # 15-1774) in order to provide&#xD;
      data comparison on an individual and group basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the relationship between amyloid burden, as assessed by 11C-PiB, with both&#xD;
           cross-sectional and longitudinal biomarkers (e.g. blood; nasal biopsy; CSF; MRI; DNA)&#xD;
           obtained in the longitudinal study (COMIRB # 15-1774, COMIRB #18-2607).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare rates of change in memory and other cognitive abilities (obtained in COMIRB #&#xD;
           15-1774, COMIRB #18-2607) in healthy subjects who show elevated amyloid deposition with&#xD;
           those who are &quot;amyloid negative&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the relationship between amyloid burden and health history, informant report of&#xD;
           subjective cognitive and psychiatric difficulties, and participant-reported psychiatric&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigate predictive utility of amyloid burden in identifying individuals most at risk&#xD;
           for conversion (e.g. healthy controls to MCI, and MCI to AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Identify why a subset of &quot;amyloid positive&quot; individuals do not show symptoms of clinical&#xD;
           AD or delay conversion to MCI or AD.&#xD;

    <description>Amyloid burden will be calculated using the standardized uptake volume ratio (SUVr) to do a centiloid analysis. This is assessed on a 100-point scale, the &quot;Centiloid&quot; (CL), where the data is scaled so that an average value of zero is amyloid-negative subjects and an average value of 100 is a typical Alzheimer's Disease patient (with negative numbers and numbers above 100 being possible). The site will scale the data along this 0-100 scale to determine amyloid burden in relation to Alzheimer's disease and compare to data from COMIRB #15-1774 or COMIRB #18-2607</description>

             assent. This person may serve as the study partner as well).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Concurrently enrolled in the Rocky Mountain Alzheimer's Disease Center at the&#xD;
             University of Colorado School of Medicine (RMADC at UCSOM) Longitudinal Biomarker and&#xD;
             Clinical Phenotyping Study (Bio-AD; COMIRB #15-1774) or Longitudinal Innate Immunity&#xD;
             and Aging study (LIIA; COMIRB #18-2607)&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Willing to have clinical research information from the Longitudinal Biomarker and&#xD;
             Clinical Phenotyping Study (COMIRB #15-1774) and/or LIIA (COMIRB #18-2607) study&#xD;
             shared/combined with the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For aging adults with atypical phenotypes (e.g., early onset Alzheimer's Disease;&#xD;
                  Posterior Cortical Atrophy; Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia), a CDR&#xD;
                  of 1 will be accepted if the study team determines that their severity is mild.&#xD;
                  The reason for this caveat is that these phenotypes often reach a CDR of 1&#xD;
                  quickly due to cortical symptoms (e.g., loss of visual perception); in these&#xD;
                  cases, the CDR may overestimate their true severity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from enrollment if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a current serious or unstable illness that in the enrolling physician's opinion,&#xD;
             could interfere with completion of the safety or efficacy evaluations included in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a known brain lesion, pathology or alternative diagnosis that strongly explains&#xD;
             the patient's clinical presentation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Are receiving any investigational medications, or have participated in a trial with&#xD;
             investigational medications within the last 30 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have had a clinical radiopharmaceutical imaging or treatment procedure within 7 days&#xD;
             prior to the study imaging session; have had a research radiopharmaceutical imaging&#xD;
             study done within 12 months or have one planned in the next 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Exposed to radiation in the work place during the previous year&#xD;
