  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In China, herbal therapy as a complementary therapy is very popular. Should conventional&#xD;
      therapy (such as donepezil and memantine) combined with herbal therapy make add-on benefit?&#xD;
      Cognition, activities of daily living and behavioral symptoms will be assessed. Data will be&#xD;
      collected from the medical records of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in memory&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Conventional therapy (CT), such as donepezil and memantine are well- known short-term&#xD;
      treatments for the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The efficacy of them, however, drops&#xD;
      below baseline level after 9 months. Should Chinese herbal medicine make add-on benefit? The&#xD;
      GRAPE formula was designed by Prof. J Tian, a prepared granules of Chinese herbs, according&#xD;
      to Qifuyin in Jing Yue Quan Shu (published in A.D. 1624). Patients treated with CT+herbal&#xD;
      therapy or CT alone for up to and over 12 months are collected. Cognition, activities of&#xD;
      daily living and behavioral symptoms are selected as outcomes for assessing the&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months, repeated measurement every 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Change of global cognition was measured by MMSE, a 30-point scale, higher score indicates better cognition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months, repeated measurement every 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Both basic ADLs (6-items) and instrumental ADLs (8-items) were measured. The ADLs contain 14 items (score 1-4), the range is 14 to 56, and higher scores indicate worse function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months, repeated measurement every 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR is a 5-point scale used to characterize six domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to Alzheimer disease and related dementias. 0 = Normal, 0.5 = Very Mild Dementia, 1 = Mild Dementia, 2 = Moderate Dementia, 3 = Severe Dementia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months, repeated measurement every 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>NPI was used for rating the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), including 12-items, with a score rang from 0-144, higher score indicates worse state.</description>

    <description>In conventional therapy group, donepezil was the commonly used ChEI(cholinesterase inhibitor) to treat mild to severe AD patients. Memantine, a NMDA(N-methyl-D-aspartate ) antagonist, was given to moderate and severe AD patients. The dose of donepezil ranged from 5 to 10 mg once a day according to patients.</description>

        AD patients involved in this retrospective, observational study will be selected from the&#xD;
        clinic registration system of memory clinics in Beijing. All the participants underwent&#xD;
        routine clinical assessments, including detailed medical history, cognitive and&#xD;
        neuropsychological tests, neurological examinations, laboratory tests (i.e. thyroid&#xD;
        function, folic acid levels, vitamin B12 levels, and routine blood tests), and&#xD;
        neuroimaging. Participants with detailed medical history will be sampled and grouped into&#xD;
        two cohorts according the therapies received.&#xD;
