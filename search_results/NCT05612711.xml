  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to study the effects of dronabinol in US Veterans with&#xD;
      agitation related to moderate to severe dementia. The main goals of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of dronabinol for the treatment of agitation in moderate to&#xD;
           severe dementia compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of dronabinol in the treatment of agitation in moderate to severe&#xD;
           dementia compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty (50) subjects will be given either dronabinol or placebo for 8 weeks. All subjects will&#xD;
      then undergo a &quot;washout&quot; phase for 3 weeks, followed by the crossover intervention (i.e.&#xD;
      subjects who received placebo during the first phase will receive dronabinol during the&#xD;
      second phase, and vice versa). Thus, all participants will be taking dronabinol at some point&#xD;
      during the study. During the study, subjects will undergo evaluations for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Agitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical changes (i.e. labs, ekg, physical exam)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a phase IIa study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      dronabinol in the treatment of agitation related to dementia in the US Veteran population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 - To evaluate the efficacy of dronabinol (target dose 5 mg bid) for the&#xD;
      treatment of agitation in dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Dronabinol improves clinically significant agitation in moderate to severe&#xD;
      dementia. Approach: The investigators will conduct a 6-week, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, crossover, exploratory study of 50 Veterans suffering from moderate to&#xD;
      severe dementia and clinically significant agitation with the Cohen Mansfield Agitation&#xD;
      Inventory (CMAI) total score as the main outcome measure. Impact: The potential benefit of&#xD;
      dronabinol in agitation will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 - To evaluate the safety of dronabinol in the treatment of agitation in&#xD;
      moderate to severe dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Dronabinol is safe for the treatment of agitation in moderate to severe dementia.&#xD;
      Approach: Outcomes of safety monitoring are to be measured by physical examination, vital&#xD;
      signs with weight, adverse event reports, electrocardiogram, safety labs including complete&#xD;
      metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), urinalysis (UA), and treatment compliance.&#xD;
      Impact: The potential adverse effects of the 5 mg dose of dronabinol will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims - The investigators will also evaluate the effect of dronabinol on&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms, caregiver distress, cognition, weight, nutritional status, pain,&#xD;
      and inflammation.&#xD;
