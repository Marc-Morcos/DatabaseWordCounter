    <textblock>
      This is a phase 0 study that will enable an assessment of biodistribution and estimation of&#xD;
      absorbed dose in humans based on data collected from five healthy volunteers, which is&#xD;
      typically the minimum number required by the FDA for first-in-human studies to assess&#xD;
      dosimetry of a new tracer. The evaluation of the brain imaging of thirty additional subjects&#xD;
      in the 2nd part of the study will lead to a descriptive assessment of the targeting and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of MPC6827 in the brain and between normal and diseased brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurodegenerative diseases are conditions where the brain cells break down, causing mental&#xD;
      and/or physical impairment. Alzheimer's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects&#xD;
      millions of individuals and causes irreversible memory loss and cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is also and incurable disorder that causes patients&#xD;
      irreversible paralysis, which results in death due to inability to breath and suffocation.&#xD;
      These disease have been shown to be associated with abnormalities in an important scaffolding&#xD;
      called microtubules, a cellular structure that help support the shape of the cells. This&#xD;
      study will explore an experimental imaging test to see if it can be used to help doctors&#xD;
      identify early microtubule changes. The test involves the injection of a radioactive compound&#xD;
      that has been shown to go to cells and bind to microtubules. Special cameras called Positron&#xD;
      Emission Tomography (PET)/CT cameras will be used to allow doctors to view where the&#xD;
      radioactive compound goes in the body, as this is the first time this radiolabeled agent is&#xD;
      being used in humans. In this study, doctors will give the new compound to up to five healthy&#xD;
      volunteers to see where it goes in the body of people who presumable have normal microtubule&#xD;
      function. Then doctors will give [11C]MPC6827 to up to 30 additional subjects (healthy&#xD;
      controls and patients with Alzheimers Disease or ALS) to focus on imaging the brain for&#xD;
      extended times. The research-imaging drug in this study is [11C]MPC6827. The radioactive drug&#xD;
      in this study is experimental, meaning it is not approved by the FDA and can only be used in&#xD;
      research studies.&#xD;

    <description>In the first stage, five healthy human subjects will receive a microdose (10 µg) of [11C]MPC6827, immediately followed by whole body PET/CT to determine dosimetry and perform an initial safety evaluation of the radiotracer. A dose of 20 mCi [11C]MPC6827 will be administered and serial whole body PET scans will be acquired up to 2 hours post injection.</description>
