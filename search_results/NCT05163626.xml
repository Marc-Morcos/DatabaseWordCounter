      The study aims to investigate the effect of a long-term combined aerobic exercise and&#xD;
      cognitive training program on cognitive function and blood exosomal synaptic protein levels&#xD;
      in seniors at increased risk for Alzheimer's Disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in people older than 65 years&#xD;
      worldwide. The neuropathological changes of AD occur decades before the onset of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, suggesting that early identification and timely intervention may postpone the&#xD;
      clinical progress. In addition to its characteristic amyloid β and tau pathology, AD is also&#xD;
      marked by synaptic dysfunction. Abnormal synaptic protein levels, such as growth associated&#xD;
      protein 43 (GAP43), neurogranin, synaptotagmins, and synaptosome associated protein 25&#xD;
      (SNAP25) have been observed in the brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Blood&#xD;
      neuro-exosomal synaptic proteins have emerged as promising predictors for AD and cognitive&#xD;
      decline. Particularly, we previously reported a combination of blood neuro-exosomal protein&#xD;
      (GAP43, neurogranin, SNAP25, and synaptotagmin 1) can predict AD 5 to 7 years before the&#xD;
      clinical onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both physical exercise and cognitive training have been demonstrated to improve cognitive&#xD;
      function in AD and to exert a protective effect against developing dementia in the normal&#xD;
      aging population. Furthermore, cognitive stimulation is an established modulator of synaptic&#xD;
      plasticity and physical exercise might regulate synapse functional and structural change.&#xD;
      However, whether cognitive training and physical exercise can alter exosomal synaptic protein&#xD;
      levels and the relationship of biomarker changes to cognitive function in those seniors at&#xD;
      increased risk for AD remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aim to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. assess the effects of a long-term combined aerobic exercise and cognitive training&#xD;
           program on cognitive function and the predictive biomarkers (blood neuro-exosomal&#xD;
           synaptic proteins: GAP43, neurogranin, SNAP25, and synaptotagmin 1) in seniors at&#xD;
           increased risk of AD with abnormally decreased levels of the biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. determine the relationship of biomarker changes with cognitive function in these people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. confirm the predictive value of the blood neuro-exosomal synaptic proteins for AD in a&#xD;
           longitudinal setting.&#xD;
