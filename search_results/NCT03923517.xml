    <textblock>
      The RHAPSODY-plus project consists of two parts. In a first step carers of people with young&#xD;
      onset dementia (YOD; onset before the age of 65) have the opportunity to use the RHAPSODY&#xD;
      online program (Kurz et al., 2016) to inform themselves about different topics on young onset&#xD;
      dementia. In a second step the participants will receive two individual counseling sessions&#xD;
      via MEET (online videoconferencing) with a social worker and a psychologist. Goal is to&#xD;
      investigate whether these counseling sessions have an additional benefit.&#xD;

      RHAPSODY-plus is a joint project of the Technische Universität München, Zentrum für kognitive&#xD;
      Störungen and the Melbourne University. The project consists of two parts. In a first step&#xD;
      carers of people with young onset dementia (YOD; onset before the age of 65) have the&#xD;
      opportunity to use the RHAPSODY online program (Kurz et al., 2016) for four weeks. This&#xD;
      e-learning program focuses on managing problem behaviors, dealing with role change, obtaining&#xD;
      support, and looking after oneself. In a second step the participants will receive two&#xD;
      individual counseling sessions via MEET (online videoconferencing). In a first session carers&#xD;
      can talk with a social worker about individual problems concerning social, financial and&#xD;
      legal issues. In a second session with a psychologist personal and emotional problems can be&#xD;
      addressed. These two sessions are about 60 minutes. The study investigates whether these&#xD;
      counseling sessions have an additional benefit. The primary aim is to determine whether the&#xD;
      intervention is considered acceptable and useful by the participants. Secondary aim is to&#xD;
      investigate whether the intervention is feasible. The sample size will be determined when&#xD;
      data saturation is reached (no new themes emerge from the qualitative data at the final&#xD;
      feedback session). From previous experiences with pilot studies using qualitative methods we&#xD;
      expect this to be achieved with approximately 20 participants. This number of participants&#xD;
      should also ensure that a diverse group of carers is participating in this pilot study (both&#xD;
      genders; different age groups, types of relatives; diagnoses (both FTD and AD) for care&#xD;
      recipients; environments (city versus rural); socioeconomic status; and carer stressors&#xD;
      (carers with children, carers who hold a job, carers with different stressors, etc.).&#xD;
