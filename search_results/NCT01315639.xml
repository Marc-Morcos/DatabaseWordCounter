      The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between plasma putative biomarkers for&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (i.e. Ab40 amyloid and total Ab42 amyloid, free, bound, free/bound,&#xD;
      truncated, sAPPα) and :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the risk of conversion of individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) into&#xD;
           Alzheimer's disease (AD),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the Alzheimer's disease progression rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rational Whether there are biological markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for&#xD;
      adequate targeting and appropriate management of the disease. The aim of our study is to&#xD;
      examine diagnostic performance and predictive and prognostic values of new plasma markers of&#xD;
      AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of studies on the predictive value of plasma concentrations of Aβ40 and 42 amyloid&#xD;
      peptides for incident AD are not straightforward. Discrepancies in these results may be due&#xD;
      to the fact that total peptide concentrations have been measured. One recent study suggests&#xD;
      that plasma free Aβ peptide concentration and particularly low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      receptor-related protein (LPR) as like as free Aβ/total Aβ ratio would be more reliable and&#xD;
      discriminant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective of the study To examine the association between plasma free Aβ peptide&#xD;
      concentration and (1) the risk of conversion of subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)&#xD;
      into Alzheimer's disease (AD) and (2) the risk of worsening of the disease in patients with&#xD;
      mild and moderate stages of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the association of total peptid Aβ concentration, free Aβ/Total Aβ ratio, and&#xD;
           trunked plasmatic Aβ to the risk of incident AD in MCI subjects, and to the risk of&#xD;
           worsening of the disease in mild and moderate AD patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the association between serum sAPP concentration and the risk of incident AD&#xD;
           in MCI subjects, and the risk of worsening of the disease in mild and moderate AD&#xD;
           patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the time evolution of concentrations of these biomarkers to Alzheimer's&#xD;
           disease progression rate which will be assessed on the basis of neuropsychological&#xD;
           examinations and MRI examination of hippocampal atrophy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the association between serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of&#xD;
           AD biomarkers in subgroup of participants who undergo lumbar puncture,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the association between neuroimaging data (cerebral volume, hippocampal&#xD;
           volume, cerebrovascular lesions and plasma and CSF AD biomarkers' concentrations,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To constitute blood and plasma banks, gene bank and CSF bank for future studies on other&#xD;
           biomarkers of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods Longitudinal multicenter study including 1300 subjects with amnestic&#xD;
      impairment (MCI, n=650 and AD, n=650) derived from the main French national Memory Resources&#xD;
      and Research Centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo at baseline and every 6 months a neurological examination, a&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment (and an oculomotor examination for those included from Broca&#xD;
      Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alzheimer disease biomarkers' measurements will be performed at inclusion and at the end of&#xD;
      the study. For those MCI participants who convert to dementia, the end of the study will&#xD;
      correspond to the AD conversion period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan will be performed at inclusion and at the end of the&#xD;
      study for MCI subjects who convert into AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lumbar puncture on an outpatient basis will be performed at study entry in all participants&#xD;
      who will give an informed consent for this examination in absence of contraindication.&#xD;
