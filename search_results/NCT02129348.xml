      Clinically, many patients with AD show no response or minimal response to antipsychotics for&#xD;
      symptoms of agitation/aggression or psychosis, or they have intolerable side effects on these&#xD;
      medications. Antipsychotics have a wide range of side effects, including the risk of&#xD;
      increased mortality (60-70% higher rate of death on antipsychotic compared to placebo) that&#xD;
      led to an FDA black box warning for patients with dementia; a more recent review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis showed a 54% increased risk of mortality. In addition, some patients show only&#xD;
      partial response to antipsychotics and symptoms persist. For these reasons, the investigators&#xD;
      need to study alternative treatment strategies. Currently, there is no FDA-approved&#xD;
      medication for the treatment of psychosis or agitation in AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators innovative project will examine the efficacy and side effects of low dose&#xD;
      lithium treatment of agitation/aggression with or without psychosis in 80 patients with AD in&#xD;
      a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial (essentially a Phase II trial).&#xD;
      The results will determine the potential for a large-scale clinical trial (Phase III) to&#xD;
      establish the utility of lithium in these patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Symptoms of psychosis or agitation are common in Alzheimer's disease. These symptoms are&#xD;
      associated with distress for the patient, an increased burden for caregivers, more rapid&#xD;
      cognitive decline, greater risk of institutionalization and mortality, and increased health&#xD;
      care costs. In a recent meta-analysis, caregiver education and behavior modification studies&#xD;
      revealed a small to medium effect size in treating agitation in these patients. However, none&#xD;
      of these studies were double-blind (difficult to achieve in such studies) and none had a&#xD;
      control group that received the same amount of staff time as the intervention group, thereby&#xD;
      biasing the results toward the active intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the psychotropic medications that have been studied, only antipsychotics have shown&#xD;
      superiority over placebo for the treatment of psychosis and agitation in patients with&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, most studies show only moderate superiority for antipsychotic over placebo and a few&#xD;
      studies have been negative. The side effects of antipsychotic medications include sedation,&#xD;
      extrapyramidal signs, tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, and the metabolic syndrome. A pooled&#xD;
      analysis from 17 short-term trials showed that the mortality rate in patients with dementia&#xD;
      receiving antipsychotic medications was 1.6 to 1.7 times as high (60-70% increase in&#xD;
      mortality rate) as the mortality rate in patients receiving placebo. These findings led the&#xD;
      FDA to issue a black-box warning for antipsychotic medication use in patients with dementia;&#xD;
      a more recent meta-analysis reported a slightly lower odds ratio of 1.54 (54% increase in&#xD;
      mortality rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lithium has several different actions from anticonvulsants, though both are effective in&#xD;
      bipolar disorder, especially mania. Lithium is not being proposed here to treat mania in AD&#xD;
      though the investigators will monitor symptoms on the Young Mania Rating Scale. In patients&#xD;
      with AD, lithium has been studied for its putative cognitive enhancing effects. A few reports&#xD;
      suggest that chronic lithium use reduces the risk of dementia, but other data show increased&#xD;
      dementia risk with lithium use. A placebo-controlled, single-blind lithium trial showed no&#xD;
      cognitive effects in patients with AD, but a recent trial of lithium in 45 patients with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI, which often leads to clinically diagnosable AD) showed a small&#xD;
      advantage for lithium (n=24) over placebo (n=21) in attention and other cognitive domains.&#xD;
      None of these studies with lithium were intended to treat psychosis or agitation in AD, and&#xD;
      patients with these symptoms typically were excluded in these clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been no systematic placebo-controlled trial of lithium to treat&#xD;
      agitation/aggression with or without psychosis in AD even though lithium is a highly&#xD;
      effective treatment for mania with psychosis and symptoms of agitation or aggression.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, the published studies of lithium to treat cognitive decline in older patients&#xD;
      show that low-dose lithium is safe in patients with MCI or AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and Hypotheses Specific Aim 1. To compare changes in agitation/aggression with&#xD;
      or without psychosis in patients with AD who receive 12 weeks of randomized, double-blind&#xD;
      treatment with lithium or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis. Over these 12 weeks, the agitation/aggression domain score on the&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) will decrease significantly more on lithium than placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis. Over these 12 weeks, the proportion of responders on lithium will be&#xD;
      significantly greater than the proportion of responders on placebo. Response is defined as a&#xD;
      30% decrease in NPI core score (defined as the sum of domains for agitation/aggression,&#xD;
      delusions and hallucinations) plus a CGI Change score of much improved or very much improved&#xD;
      (CGI based on these behavioral symptoms only). Exploratory hypothesis. Over these 12 weeks,&#xD;
      the psychosis score, measured by the sum of the NPI domain scores for delusions and&#xD;
      hallucinations, will decrease significantly more on lithium than placebo. Specific Aim 2. To&#xD;
      evaluate the tolerability of low dose lithium by assessing emergent somatic side effects over&#xD;
      the course of the 12-week trial on lithium compared to placebo. Specific Aim 3. To explore&#xD;
      associations between improvement on lithium (decrease in agitation/aggression and psychosis&#xD;
      scores) and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels (baseline, 12 weeks), a SNP&#xD;
      in intron 1 of the ACCN1 gene, and variation at the 7q11.2 gene locus, because these indices&#xD;
      are associated with lithium response in bipolar disorder. The investigators do not postulate&#xD;
      a specific mechanism of action for lithium in the investigators trial, but will evaluate&#xD;
      these three potential predictors of lithium response with the aim of improving patient&#xD;
      selection for personalized treatment. The investigators will examine BDNF serum levels as a&#xD;
      biomarker correlate of lithium treatment by correlating change in BDNF levels with change in&#xD;
      NPI agitation/aggression and psychosis scores.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical Responder Defined as a 30% Decrease in NPI Core Score (Sum Score of NPI Domains of Agitation/Aggression, Delusions and Hallucinations) Together With a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Behavior Change Score of 1 or 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is classified as a responder (score=1) if both criteria are met or as a non-responder (score=0) if both criteria are not met. The first criterion to determine responder status, NPI core score, has a scoring range 0-36; each of the three component scores for symptoms of agitation/aggression, delusions and hallucinations has a scoring range 0-12. For each symptom and the total score, higher score indicates more symptoms. The second criterion to determine responder status, Clinical Global Impression (CGI), is used to assess change in overall behavior; scoring range 1-7 with higher scores indicating worsening over time and lower scores indicating improvement over time. Only patients who met both criteria, assessed as change compared to baseline, were counted as responders; all other patients were non-responders. Patients that demonstrated improvement at week 12 were reported; scores for earlier weeks were only used to assess progress throughout the study.</description>

&#xD;
          8. Clinical stroke with residual neurological deficits. MRI findings of cerebrovascular&#xD;
             disease (small infarcts, lacunes, periventricular disease) in the absence of clinical&#xD;
             stroke with residual neurological deficits will not lead to exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Acute, severe, unstable medical illness. For cancer, patients with active illness or&#xD;
             metastases will be excluded, but past history of successfully treated cancer will not&#xD;

        <description>The patient is classified as a responder (score=1) if both criteria are met or as a non-responder (score=0) if both criteria are not met. The first criterion to determine responder status, NPI core score, has a scoring range 0-36; each of the three component scores for symptoms of agitation/aggression, delusions and hallucinations has a scoring range 0-12. For each symptom and the total score, higher score indicates more symptoms. The second criterion to determine responder status, Clinical Global Impression (CGI), is used to assess change in overall behavior; scoring range 1-7 with higher scores indicating worsening over time and lower scores indicating improvement over time. Only patients who met both criteria, assessed as change compared to baseline, were counted as responders; all other patients were non-responders. Patients that demonstrated improvement at week 12 were reported; scores for earlier weeks were only used to assess progress throughout the study.</description>
