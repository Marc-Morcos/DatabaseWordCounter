    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of support group intervention for&#xD;
      primary caregivers of a person with dementia or similar cognitive impairment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to determine if participation in caregiver support groups and individual&#xD;
      differences between caregivers influence the decision of the caregiver to place their family&#xD;
      member in a long-term care facility. This research also aims to identify significant&#xD;
      predictor variables of outcome. The intervention to be employed has been empirically&#xD;
      supported by past research (Gonyea, 2006), but additional research is required to establish&#xD;
      this intervention as an empirically supported treatment for caregivers. The proposed research&#xD;
      will examine the hypotheses that: (A) a brief 6-session caregiver support group will reduce&#xD;
      caregiver burden and depression and delay or prevent transition to long-term care (e.g.,&#xD;
      nursing home care); and (B) specific caregiver characteristics will emerge as significant&#xD;
      moderators of treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first activity of the proposed research will involve the advertisement of the caregiver&#xD;
      support group. The caregiver support group advertisement will be posted in various facilities&#xD;
      related to the care of older adults in the surrounding community and will also be distributed&#xD;
      via email listserves. Next, individuals who are interested in the study and caregiver support&#xD;
      group will contact the principal investigator or research assistants via the telephone number&#xD;
      or email address listed on the advertisement. The proposed research utilizes a UCF behavioral&#xD;
      intervention group and a community comparison group. The UCF behavioral intervention group&#xD;
      will be based on the principles of behavior therapy and behavioral activation. Groups are&#xD;
      designed to teach caregivers specific behavioral techniques for managing care recipients'&#xD;
      symptoms in the home environment. The community comparison group will be a &quot;treatment as&#xD;
      usual&quot; group; participants will be recruited from various established caregiver support&#xD;
      groups in the community. The UCF behavioral intervention caregiver support groups will be&#xD;
      highly structured and will be conducted with up to 13 members. The UCF behavioral&#xD;
      intervention caregiver support groups will be run over the course of 6 weeks, with groups&#xD;
      meeting once a week for 90 minutes. Groups will be scheduled at weekly intervals, as is&#xD;
      characteristic for most psychotherapeutic support groups. The intake packet will include&#xD;
      questions that are biological, psychological, and social in nature. Caregivers will also be&#xD;
      asked questions related to their caregiving situation. Included in the packet are the&#xD;
      following measures: demographic survey, ADL and IADL survey, caregiver preparedness scale,&#xD;
      Center for Epidemiological Studies Short Depression Scale (CES-D 10), familial obligation&#xD;
      scale, caregiver strain index, a neuropsychological symptom index, and a satisfaction survey.&#xD;
      In addition, participants will completed at-home collection of saliva samples for measurement&#xD;
      of stress hormone variation (cortisol). Saliva samples will be collected using oral swabs,&#xD;
      which will be stored in number-coded tubes. Participants will record the time of day samples&#xD;
      were collected, and provide subjective measures of psychological stress. Completed sample&#xD;
      kits will be collected by study research assistants and brought back to th lab freezer for&#xD;
      storage. This procedure will be repeated after the final session of the intervention. The&#xD;
      group facilitator and co-faclitator will review the consent form with caregivers in person at&#xD;
      the beginning of the first session. Participants who agree to take part in the caregiver&#xD;
      support group and the proposed research will be given a copy of the consent form and will&#xD;
      remain present for the current and subsequent sessions. If a participant is absent from a UCF&#xD;
      behavioral intervention group session, he/she will be contacted by telephone and encouraged&#xD;
      to attend future session as is consistent with standard clinic procedure. The investigators&#xD;
      will not exclude a participant's data from analyses if he/she does not attend all six&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be audio taped during this study. If a participant does not want to be&#xD;
      audio taped, he/she will not be able to participate in the study and will be referred to an&#xD;
      alternate provider if interested in receiving services elsewhere. The purpose of audio taping&#xD;
      is to monitor consistency among the group sessions and to ensure treatment fidelity. The&#xD;
      recordings will be reviewed only by principle investigator Dr. Paulson and the&#xD;
      co-investigators, and will be deleted within two weeks of the recording. Audio recordings&#xD;
      will be saved locally on an encrypted iPad used only for research purposes that is stored in&#xD;
      a locked file cabinet in the OLDeR research lab, which requires code and card access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be performed at 6 month intervals until the caregiving relationship has ended&#xD;
      (if the caregiving relationship persists, follow-up will cease at 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both the UCF behavioral intervention group and the community comparison group,&#xD;
      participants will be contacted via telephone at 6 month intervals (after the termination of&#xD;
      the 6-week support group for the UCF behavioral intervention group, and every 6 months&#xD;
      following the termination of the first UCF behavioral intervention caregiver support group&#xD;
      for community comparison participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intended sample size for the proposed research includes 30 participants in the UCF&#xD;
      behavioral intervention group and 30 participants in the community comparison group for a&#xD;
      total of 60 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed statistical methods for data analyses include intent-to-treat (ITT) with last&#xD;
      observation carried forward.&#xD;
