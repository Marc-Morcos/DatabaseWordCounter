  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Atlas of Retinal Imaging in Alzheimer's (ARIAS) study is a 5-year study examining the&#xD;
      natural history of retinal imaging biomarkers associated with disease risk, disease burden,&#xD;
      and disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The objective of this project is to&#xD;
      create a 'gold standard' reference database of structural anatomic and functional imaging of&#xD;
      the retina, in order to enable the identification and development of both sensitive and&#xD;
      reliable markers of AD risk and/or progression. Our ultimate goal is to develop a new&#xD;
      screening protocol that identifies changes related to AD 10-20 years before AD is clinically&#xD;
      visible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a longitudinal, within-participants prospective natural history study.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited on the basis of serial referrals to the memory disorders&#xD;
      centers at all three investigative sites, as well as by Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      (IRB)-approved radio, social media and print advertisements. All participants will meet&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria for one of the four (4) participant groups. All participants&#xD;
      will be recruited into the study over a 24-month enrollment period. Once enrollment closes,&#xD;
      participants will be followed for 3 years, with examinations at one of the four study&#xD;
      locations at baseline, 12 months post-enrollment, 24 months post-enrollment, and 36 months&#xD;
      post-enrollment. All exam and testing procedures are described below. All retinal imaging&#xD;
      will be completed on an FDA-approved clinical OCT imaging system by trained study personnel&#xD;
      (with quality assurance and participant safety managed by two Co-Principal Investigator&#xD;
      (PI)'s and their staff). Pupillometry and contrast sensitivity vision testing will rely on&#xD;
      FDA-approved and commercially widely available devices and standard clinical procedures. All&#xD;
      techniques are well-known to both PI's, and these techniques have been in regular use by&#xD;
      their clinical research and/or clinical care groups for the past 6+ years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit a cheek swab will be obtained to determine apolipoprotein (APOE)&#xD;
      genotype. Enrollment and group assignment will be established once the genotyping results are&#xD;
      received (i.e., approximately 55 minutes following cheek swab, and by the end of each&#xD;
      screening visit), at which point individuals who meet enrollment criteria will be scheduled&#xD;
      for their baseline visit. PIs may choose to include disclosure of APOE genotyping results in&#xD;
      their location-specific protocol, if they have the appropriate clinical resources and local&#xD;
      IRB approval for disclosure procedures. Genotyping results will not be released to&#xD;
      participants or their physicians except through the process of an IRB approved, site-specific&#xD;
      protocol for disclosure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit (i.e., baseline, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months) participants will&#xD;
      undergo an eye examination and screening for ophthalmic disease, a medical screening exam,&#xD;
      vital signs, neuropsychological assessment, a blood sample for measurement of plasma&#xD;
      biomarkers, and a full retinal imaging exam. All participants will be asked to provide&#xD;
      consent to allow review of medical records, including relevant imaging (including both&#xD;
      clinical reports and Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) image files for&#xD;
      computerized tomography (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) neuroimaging) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker evidence of AD, if&#xD;
      available. Additional clinical and experimental endpoints will include measures of gait,&#xD;
      sleep quality, social and psychological health, and pupillometry. Assessment of sleep&#xD;
      architecture (i.e., actigraphy measures) will be collected via wearable trackers over the&#xD;
      course of a 2-week period following the baseline and 36-month study visits. A subset of&#xD;
      participants, in each of the subject groups, will be asked to take an over-the-counter herbal&#xD;
      supplement (Longvida curcumin; Verdure Sciences, Inc., www.longvida.com) for two days prior&#xD;
      to their baseline exams.&#xD;
