  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using excess tumour samples that contain amyoid, from patients with Medullary Thyroid Cancer,&#xD;
      we aim to determine the structures of ex vivo amyloid fibrils from human tumour tissue&#xD;
      samples and compare them with that of existing stock of in vitro formed amyloid fibrils. This&#xD;
      will permit the analysis of the effects of gene mutation and post-translational modification&#xD;
      on the development of amyloid from a disease state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amyloid is known to accumulate in the brain tissue of patients with neuro-degenerative&#xD;
      conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Dementia. Therefore solving the structure of&#xD;
      amyloid fibrils may aid the development of future treatments for these conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an anonymous, voluntary inclusion, laboratory based, basic science research study.&#xD;
      Appropriate patients who meet the inclusion criteria and complete the consent process will be&#xD;
      asked to donate a small sample of excess tumour tissue after the completion of their surgical&#xD;
      procedure. This tissue will be transferred to the research laboratory in Leeds University for&#xD;
      analysis and subject to a variety of investigations and scientific procedures to achieve the&#xD;
      study objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - amyloid extraction by tissue homogenization and centrifugation as already documented&#xD;
           in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - mass spectrometry analysis to identify and characterize the most prominent proteins&#xD;
           present in the amyloid deposits and their possible post-translational modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Transmission Electron Microscopy to characterize at the gross features of the&#xD;
           extracted amyloid fibrils at low resolution (&gt;20Å). This relatively simple procedure&#xD;
           allows for quick characterization of the samples in order to optimize them for Atomic&#xD;
           Force Microscopy (AFM) and Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Atomic Force microscopy to characterize helical parameters of the amyloid fibrils&#xD;
           needed to calculate the structure from Cryo-EM data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - Cryo-Electron Microscopy to elucidate the structure of the amyloids extracted from&#xD;
           tissue affected in each disease&#xD;
