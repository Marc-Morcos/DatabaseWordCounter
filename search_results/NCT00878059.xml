    <textblock>
      This is a research study about how family members make research participation decisions for a&#xD;
      relative with Alzheimer's or a related dementia. The purpose of this study is to learn more&#xD;
      about how proxies (the family member who makes decisions for that relative), would think&#xD;
      through decisions about whether to enroll their relative in studies for not-yet-approved&#xD;
      medications for Alzheimer's Disease. The long-term goal of the study is to improve the way&#xD;
      researchers inform families about clinical research studies and opportunities for&#xD;
      participation. This study is being sponsored by the National Institute on Aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be interviewed by a research staff member about research enrollment&#xD;
      decisions for their relative. A number of standardized questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;
      There is only one visit required. The interview lasts about three hours. The investigators&#xD;
      will try to make it as convenient as possible for your schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-intervention study. UCSF CHR # H58055-31168-02 v.1 Date: 012709&#xD;

      -  The researcher will interview you for about 3 hours in a private office.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study location: All these procedures will be done at Dr. Dunn's research offices at&#xD;
           UCSF. If you prefer, we can conduct the interview at your home in or near the San&#xD;
           Francisco bay area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked questions about your general background, and about how providing care&#xD;
           for the person with Alzheimer's Disease has affected you. You will also be asked some&#xD;
           basic questions about the person with Alzheimer's Disease (such as how well they are&#xD;
           functioning; personal information will not be collected, however).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then, you will be given a consent form for an imaginary study related to Alzheimer&#xD;
           Disease. An imaginary study means that it is not a real study, but it is a made-up one.&#xD;
           You or your relative will not really participate in the study that is described in the&#xD;
           consent form, because it is only imaginary and created just for this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then, you will be asked questions to measure how well you understood the information&#xD;
           presented to you. For example, you will be asked about the procedures, risks and&#xD;
           benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also be interviewed regarding your opinions and attitudes about research&#xD;
           participation. If you give your permission, we will audiotape this interview to help us&#xD;
           more accurately record this information. You may refuse to answer any of the questions&#xD;
           that make you uncomfortable. You do not have to agree to be audio-taped to participate&#xD;
           in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given some tests designed to measure memory, attention and other thinking&#xD;
           abilities. These tests are for research purposes only, and are not being used for any&#xD;
           type of diagnostic purposes. The research purpose is to help us understand proxies'&#xD;
           abilities to make decisions as caregivers for seriously ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked questions about your mood and about caring for someone with dementia.&#xD;
           You may refuse to answer and questions that make you uncomfortable.&#xD;
