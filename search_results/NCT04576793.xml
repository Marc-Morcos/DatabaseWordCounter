  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how inflammation is related to other changes in the&#xD;
      brain that occur during the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The investigators are also&#xD;
      studying how inflammation is related to the symptoms that first occur in patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this reason, the investigators are asking people with different&#xD;
      versions of Alzheimer's disease to participate. This includes patients with either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Posterior cortical atrophy - a version of Alzheimer's disease with vision difficulties&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia - a version of Alzheimer's disease with&#xD;
           language difficulties&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amnestic Alzheimer's disease - a &quot;typical&quot; version of Alzheimer's disease with memory&#xD;
           difficulties&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators are also enrolling older adults with normal visual, language, and&#xD;
           memory function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn about inflammation in Alzheimer's disease so that the&#xD;
      investigators can find out new ways to treat patients with this disease. Because Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease usually causes slow changes to the brain over time, in this study the investigators&#xD;
      are going to perform different tests and then repeat some of them two years later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation can be measured using a type of brain scan called a positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) scan. A PET scan uses very small amounts of a radioactive drug that is injected into a&#xD;
      vein to create a special picture of the brain. The inflammation PET scan uses a drug called&#xD;
      ER176. ER176 is an experimental drug but has been used in several human studies before. Once&#xD;
      in the body, ER176 sticks to areas with lots of inflammation, and the PET scan allows us to&#xD;
      see these areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation can also be measured by looking at certain proteins in the spinal fluid. In&#xD;
      order to measure these proteins in the spinal fluid, the investigators need to perform a&#xD;
      lumbar puncture (spinal tap). Certain genes that inherited from parents influence the amount&#xD;
      of inflammation in the body. The investigators can study how genes affect inflammation in&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease by looking doing genetic tests on blood that collected from the vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators can study how genes affect inflammation in Alzheimer's disease by doing&#xD;
      genetic tests on blood. The investigators will also be testing blood for severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome (SARS)- CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) antibodies. The&#xD;
      investigators want to see if exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 changes the amount of&#xD;
      inflammation in the brain or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with inflammation, Alzheimer's disease is also associated with the build up of the&#xD;
      proteins amyloid and tau in the brain. The investigators can measure these proteins using PET&#xD;
      scans. The amyloid PET scan uses a drug called florbetaben that has been approved by the FDA&#xD;
      to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease. The tau PET scan uses a drug called MK-6240. Like&#xD;
      ER176, MK-6240 is experimental but has been used in several human studies before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brain MRI creates a high resolution picture of the brain. The brain MRI helps the&#xD;
      investigators get more information from the PET scans, and can also tell the investigators&#xD;
      the size and appearance of different brain structures. When someone has Alzheimer's disease,&#xD;
      some of these brain structures get smaller or have altered appearance on MRI.&#xD;
