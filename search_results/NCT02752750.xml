      In this explorative longitudinal study 50 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 50&#xD;
      age-matched control subjects will be recruited for their 2 years follow-ups and undergo&#xD;
      extensive cognitive testing and quantitative 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
      Regional differences of susceptibility and R2* relaxation rates in deep gray matter and the&#xD;
      neocortex will be evaluated in AD patients and controls and related to the patients´&#xD;
      cognitive status at baseline.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Abnormally increased brain iron accumulation in deep gray matter is a common finding in&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyloid protein precursor and tau proteins were linked to&#xD;
      disrupted iron homeostasis. Validation studies showed that brain iron can be measured&#xD;
      precisely by the novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique quantitative susceptibility&#xD;
      mapping (QSM) in vivo, thus, enabling reliable and precise longitudinal investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that pathologic brain iron accumulation can be assessed with higher&#xD;
      sensitivity with QSM than with current MRI techniques such as R2* relaxation rate mapping and&#xD;
      that regional QSM is a predictor for cognitive decline and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This explorative longitudinal study is including 50 patients with AD and age-matched control&#xD;
      subjects which will be recruited for their 2 years follow-ups and undergo extensive cognitive&#xD;
      testing and quantitative 3 Tesla MRI. Regional differences of susceptibility and R2* in deep&#xD;
      gray matter and the neocortex will be evaluated in AD patients and controls and related to&#xD;
      the patients´ cognitive status at baseline. Follow-up MRI and clinical data with multivariate&#xD;
      regression analysis serve to investigate the dynamics of AD-related changes of&#xD;
      susceptibility, and their relation to cognitive functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, this explorative longitudinal study in a patient cohort aims to clarify&#xD;
      whether regional QSM changes are potential biomarkers for AD progression.&#xD;
