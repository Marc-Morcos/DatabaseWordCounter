  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies consistently show the negative health impact of sleep problems in both Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD) patients and their caregivers. However, only a few sleep interventions have been&#xD;
      conducted for AD patients or their caregivers in community settings and none have addressed&#xD;
      both members of the dyad concurrently. To fill these gaps, this study aims to develop a sleep&#xD;
      intervention program specifically tailored for AD patient/caregiver dyads who both experience&#xD;
      sleep difficulties.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2015, Americans provided 18 billion hours of unpaid care for patients with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD) and other dementias, with an economic value of $221 billion. This estimate may&#xD;
      be even higher among caregivers of AD patients when they have sleep problems. In fact, the&#xD;
      caregivers' sleep is often disturbed by nighttime sleep disturbance of AD patients, which is&#xD;
      one of the major reasons why those patients are admitted to institutions. Due to the&#xD;
      bidirectional nature of sleep disturbance in AD patients and their caregivers, it is critical&#xD;
      to develop a sleep intervention program for the dyad that addresses sleep disturbance in both&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nighttime sleep disturbance in AD patients is associated with shorter survival, lower quality&#xD;
      of life, and decreased social engagement. Poor sleep among their caregivers is associated&#xD;
      with increased depressive symptoms, higher levels of caregiver role burden, and increased&#xD;
      inflammation, which is known to increase risk for cardiovascular disease. Such decline in&#xD;
      caregivers' health may then impact the quality of care for AD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral sleep intervention programs for AD patients or caregivers are feasible but&#xD;
      long-term effects on improving sleep and health remain unclear. No behavioral sleep&#xD;
      interventions have focused on the patient-caregiver dyad, and only a few behavioral sleep&#xD;
      intervention studies have targeted community-dwelling AD patients or caregivers. Dyad-based&#xD;
      sleep interventions may have better effects on sleep and other health outcomes because of the&#xD;
      influence of AD patients on their caregivers and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention focuses on educating caregivers to improve their own and the&#xD;
      patients' sleep, using behavioral sleep management techniques. This intervention builds upon&#xD;
      a previous caregiver focus group study (VA HSR&amp;D LIP 65-154, PI: Song) and the existing sleep&#xD;
      interventional research studies, which included patients with mild cognitive impairments and&#xD;
      AD patients. The sleep program involves 4 face-to-face meetings plus 1 telephone session.&#xD;
      Phase 1 study aims to iteratively refine and finalize the intervention program materials with&#xD;
      5 AD patient/caregiver dyads. Phase 2 study aims to pilot test the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention program (n=20 dyads) on sleep, health, and quality of life in both members of&#xD;
      the group, compared to a non-directive education-only control program (n=20 dyads) in a small&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. Primary outcomes will include objective sleep efficiency and&#xD;
      total wake time measured by actigraphy for AD patients and subjective sleep measured by the&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for caregivers. A unique aspect of the proposed study is that&#xD;
      the program is tailored to address sleep problems of both patients and caregivers, and&#xD;
      includes upstream biomarkers to evaluate a key mechanism of intervention benefits that can be&#xD;
      further explored in future research.&#xD;
