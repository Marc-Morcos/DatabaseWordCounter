  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will investigate how light delivering 40 hertz (Hz) affects subjective sleep&#xD;
      and cognition in a controlled laboratory study. A lab study will allow the collection of&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) data, perform cognitive tests, and observe the response in those&#xD;
      with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to a healthy control group (HC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend two study sessions over the course of two weeks. During both&#xD;
      sessions, all participants will experience 10 minutes of a low-level light, followed by a&#xD;
      data collection period which involves a sleepiness rating, an electroencephalogram (EEG)&#xD;
      recording, and a computerized memory test. Participants will then experience either a RL or a&#xD;
      placebo RL condition for one hour, after which there will be a second data collection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will demonstrate the effect of 40 hertz (Hz) rhythmic light (RL) to promote&#xD;
      gamma wave entrainment (rhythmic light [RL]) on: brain response (electroencephalography&#xD;
      [EEG]); cognitive performance (working memory task); and subjective sleepiness&#xD;
      (questionnaires). The study will recruit 20 adult mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients&#xD;
      and 20 healthy, age-matched controls (HC) to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions will initiate with a 10-minute adaptation period to a low-level ambient light&#xD;
      providing illuminance of 15 lux at participants' eye level on a vertical plane, followed by a&#xD;
      pre-exposure data collection period, including Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), EEG, and a&#xD;
      working memory task. Participants will experience either 40 Hz RL or placebo RL conditions&#xD;
      for a duration of 1 hour, followed by the second data collection period. On the second data&#xD;
      collection day, participants will experience the other condition, so that all participants&#xD;
      experience both lighting conditions. The experimental sessions will start at 14:00 on each&#xD;
      experimental day which will be separated by 1 week.&#xD;

    <description>Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, lasting 3-minutes each, will occur 2 times per experimental session. The power at 40 hertz (Hz), 4-8 Hz (theta), and 30-55 Hz (low gamma) frequency ranges will be calculated at each electrode site. Entrainment to the 40 Hz rhythmic stimulation will be assessed in terms of increases in power at 40 Hz.</description>
