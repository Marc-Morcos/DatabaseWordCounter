  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) for an evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention for people with moderate to severe dementia in Hong Kong. The psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention is adapted from Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST), translated and adapted for&#xD;
      the Hong Kong Chinese population, and developed within the Medical Research Council (MRC)&#xD;
      framework.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization calls for an increase of psychosocial interventions for&#xD;
      dementia-a global epidemic. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is the only&#xD;
      non-pharmacological therapy recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care&#xD;
      Excellence for improving cognition for mild to moderate dementia. However, there is little&#xD;
      guidance on how to maximise cognition for severe dementia. Advanced Cognitive Stimulation&#xD;
      Therapy (ACST) will be the first evidence-based complex intervention for moderate to severe&#xD;
      dementia developed within the Medical Research Framework and building upon CST's key&#xD;
      principles. This feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to 1) translate and adapt&#xD;
      ACST for the Chinese population; 3) evaluate the feasibility of Advanced Cognitive&#xD;
      Stimulation Therapy - Hong Kong (ACST-HK). A sample of 32 participants will be recruited,&#xD;
      where 16 will be randomly allocated to ACST, and 16 to treatment as usual (TAU). Data will be&#xD;
      collected pre and post the 7-week intervention period. Improving the cognition and QoL for&#xD;
      people with moderate to severe dementia is vital because dementia's prevalence is projected&#xD;
      to reach 152 million by 2050, resulting in excessive excess disability. Developing an&#xD;
      intervention targeting Chinese-the largest aging population-is also novel and allows ACST-HK&#xD;
      to impact internationally from its infancy.&#xD;

    <description>Exploratory primary outcome; measured pre and post intervention with Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination (Molloy &amp; Standish, 1997) and Test for Severe Impairment (Albert &amp; Cohen, 1992). SMMSE has 11 questions with scores from 0 to 30, where a low score indicates poor performance. TSI has six domains: motor performance, language comprehension, language production, memory, general knowledge, and conceptualisation. Each domain has a maximum score of 4, and a higher score indicates better cognitive ability.</description>

    <description>Exploratory secondary outcome; measured pre and post test with the Cantonese Version of Neuropsychiatric Inventory (CNPI) (Cummings et al., 1997; Leung et al., 2001). CNPI consists of 12 domains. Each question asks for a frequency of symptoms on a 4-point score, severity on a 3-point score, and distress on a 5-point scale. Higher score denotes higher frequency and severity.</description>

    <description>Advanced Cognitive Stimulation Therapy Hong Kong (ACST-HK), a psychosocial intervention, is the modified version of CST for people with moderate and severe dementia. Activities consist of more multisensory stimulation elements than the original CST. It has also been translated and adapted for the Hong Kong Chinese population.&#xD;
ACST-HK will be prescribed to participants 45-minutes per week, biweekly for 7 weeks. The intervention will be delivered by two facilitators, such as a research staff, clinical psychologist trainee, or care home staff.</description>
