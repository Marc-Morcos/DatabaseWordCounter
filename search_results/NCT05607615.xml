  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 90 patients, aged 50 to 80 years, with a diagnosis of early Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      will take part in this research study. This study will be conducted in the US. There will be&#xD;
      3 treatment groups: 2 Active doses and 1 group will receive placebo completely by chance.&#xD;
      Patients, caregiver, Sponsor, nor study staff will know which treatment is assigned. There&#xD;
      are 3 periods in this study: Screening to confirm suitability, Treatment to receive study&#xD;
      medication, and Follow-up to check overall health post-participation&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study that will assess&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of Trappsol Cyclo in patients with EAD as&#xD;
      defined according to the FDA Guidance for Industry on Early Alzheimer's Disease: Developing&#xD;
      Drugs for Treatment. The study will enroll approximately 90 (30 patients/treatment arm) male&#xD;
      and female patients aged 50 to 80 years at Screening with characteristic pathophysiologic&#xD;
      changes of AD who meet National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria&#xD;
      for either AD with MCI or mild AD collectively known as EAD (Stages 3 and 4). Enrolled&#xD;
      patients must have evidence of progressive cognitive decline in the last year as determined&#xD;
      by serial cognitive test scores, if available, or patient or informant/caregiver/study&#xD;
      partner (hereafter called caregiver) report as documented by the Investigator&#xD;
