  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer disease is a frequent disease in the late ages that results in global alteration of&#xD;
      cognitive functions. In which memory complaint can be isolated in the early stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiopathology of neuronal degenerescence in Alzheimer disease is complex, two main&#xD;
      histological lesions are known, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillar tangles. Beyond the&#xD;
      histological knowledge, alterations of neuronal metabolism are described such as oxydative&#xD;
      phosphorylation and glycolytic pathway. These metabolism alterations are involved in neuronal&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-nucleus magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive non-irradiant imagery&#xD;
      technique already used in routine. This technic allows the phosphoenergetic pool assessment,&#xD;
      that inform about cellular metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to explore the phosphorylated metabolism patterns as predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers of cognitive decline in patients with a memory complaint diagnosed.&#xD;
