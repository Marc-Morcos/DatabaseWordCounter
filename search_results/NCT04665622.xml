    <measure>Cognitive Theory of mind during an artwork observation: Score 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Subject's estimation of the distance perceived by the character represented on the artwork, at a 1st and a 2nd observation of the painting. Score 1 is the ratio of estimated distances (distance2/distance1).</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Theory of mind during an artwork observation: Score 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Subject's estimation of the time perceived by the character represented on the artwork, at a 1st and a 2nd observation of the painting. Score 2 is the ratio of estimated times (time2 / time1).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Theory of mind: TOM-15 a false-belief task to assess cognitive theory of mind</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The task presents 15 stories. The subject must answer the question asked by choosing among two propositions, the correct answer consisting in attributing the correct belief to the character represented. Total score (/ 15).&#xD;
ToM 15 is used as reference test for correlation study with score1 and score 2.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Affective ToM (Score 3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>At observation, 1 and 2, subject must attribute an emotion to the character represented on the artwork, choosing an answer among 6 propositions: 3 negative mental states, 2 neutral and 1 positive.&#xD;
Score 3 rating : 2 points if a negative emotion is attributed to the 1st and 2nd observation; 1 point if the negative emotion is attributed only to the 2nd observation; 0.5 point if the negative emotion is attributed only to the 1st observation; 0 point if no negative emotion is attributed.</description>

    <measure>Affective ToM : The Reading the Mind in the Eye test - RME - (Baron-Cohen S at al., 2001)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The task consisted of 36 black-and-white photographs of the eye area of faces. Subject is asked to choose which word, among four options, best described what the character in the photograph was thinking or feeling. Total score (/36) and three emotional valence sub-scores: positive (/8), neutral (/16) and negative (/12) according to the procedure described by Harkness et al., 2005.&#xD;
RME is used as reference test for correlation study with Score 3.</description>

    <measure>Affective empathy: Score 4.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Intensity of the emotion felt by the participant following observation of the table, using an EVA scale [0-10].</description>

    <measure>Affective empathy: The Empathy Quotient (EQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Self-administered questionnaire of 40 questions. Participant must choose one of the four propositions (&quot;strongly agree&quot;, &quot;tend to agree&quot;, &quot;tend to disagree&quot;, &quot;strongly disagree&quot;) awarding 0, 1 or 2 points. Total Score / 60.&#xD;
EQ is used as reference test for correlation study with Score 4.</description>
