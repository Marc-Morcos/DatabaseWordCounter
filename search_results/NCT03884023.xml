    <textblock>
      The investigators assume that REST gene polymorphism affects REST protein concentration, and&#xD;
      REST protein concentration in peripheral blood is related to cognitive function and&#xD;
      hippocampus. In this current study, REST protein content and gene polymorphism will be&#xD;
      obtained in peripheral blood in AD and normal control. The effect of REST gene polymorphism&#xD;
      on REST protein concentration will be discovered.The relationship between REST protein&#xD;
      concentration and cognitive function will be found, as well as the relationship between REST&#xD;
      protein concentration and hippocampus.&#xD;

      Repressor element silencing transcription factor(REST), also known as neuron-restrictive&#xD;
      silencer factor (NRSF) is a zinc finger protein of 121 kD and belongs to the Gli-Kruppel&#xD;
      family with transcriptional regulation.This will be a Case-Crossover research. Consecutive&#xD;
      participants will be divided into Alzheimer's disease dementia group, mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment due to Alzheimer's disease group and normal control group according to inclusion&#xD;
      criteria of this research. Peripheral blood samples will be retained to detect REST gene&#xD;
      polymorphisms and protein concentrations. Participants perform neuropsychological tests to&#xD;
      assess cognitive function. Medial temporal atrophy scale is used to describe hippocampus.&#xD;
      Differences in the mean or proportions between these 3 groups will be checked by t test or&#xD;
      test. The relationship between REST protein concentration and cognitive function will be&#xD;
      estimated, as well as the relationship between REST protein concentration and hippocampus.&#xD;
