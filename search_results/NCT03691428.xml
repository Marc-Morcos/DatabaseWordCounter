  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study designed to pilot a WOOP (Wish Outcome Obstacle Plan) intervention for&#xD;
      spouses of persons with early stage dementia for the purposes of future research. The&#xD;
      investigators will be using two cohorts. One who will get the intervention and the other who&#xD;
      will be wait listed and receive the intervention at a later date. Spouses of persons with&#xD;
      dementia will use WOOP, a brief goal attainment sequence, every day for 16 days. Participants&#xD;
      will complete surveys before the intervention, at Day 16, and at a 3-month follow-up. The&#xD;
      outcome measures are goal attainment, emotion regulation skills, psychological health, and&#xD;
      support quality. As of 9/2020 this entire study is being conducted remotely.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) will be used to examine participants' stress over the past week. There are 10 items rated on a scale from 0 to 4. Greater scores indicate greater stress. Sum scores can range from 0 to 40 with 40 being the highest stress and 0 being the lowest.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Nine self-reported positive emotions (e.g., amusement, gratitude, hope) on a 1-5 scale over the past week using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (25 items). Higher scores indicate more positive emotions. Mean scores can range from 1 to 5 with 5 being the highest experience of positive emotions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depressive Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression Scale (CESD). Participants rate on a scale from 0 to 3. Higher numbers indicate more depressive symptoms. Sum scores can range from 0 to 30 with higher sums cores meaning more depressive symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was measured with the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD). The QOL-AD consists of 13 items that capture multiple aspects of a person's quality of life in the context of dementia. It can also be used to examine the quality of life of family members of persons with dementia. Participants rate on a 5-point scale from poor to excellent the degree to which they feel about different aspects of their life (e.g. physical health, energy, mood, memory, family). Sum scores can range from 13 to 65 with higher scores meaning higher quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Negative Emotions</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ten negative (e.g., irritable, distressed) adjectives were measured with the Positive and Negative Affect Scale. Each item has a score of 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). The mean of the 10 items will be measured. Mean scores can range from 1 to 5 with 5 meaning the highest experience of negative emotions.</description>

    <description>1. Wish or goal: A wish (e.g. &quot;responding calmly when the partner asks a question repeatedly&quot;). 2. Outcome: The most positive outcome of realizing the wish or goal (e.g. &quot;both partners feel respected and happy&quot;). Then the participant vividly imagines the outcome. 3. Obstacle: The most critical internal, controllable, obstacle (e.g., &quot;feeling impatient&quot;). Then the participant vividly imagines the internal obstacle occurring. 4. Plan: The participant answers the following question: What action can I take or what thought can I think to overcome the obstacle (e.g., &quot;take a deep breath, take my partner's perspective, and answer the question calmly&quot;); then he or she forms an &quot;if&quot; [specified obstacle - when I feel impatient], &quot;then I will&quot; [specified action or thought to overcome obstacle - take a deep breath, take my partner's perspective, and answer the question calmly] plan.</description>

        <title>Change in Quality of Life</title>
        <description>Quality of life was measured with the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD). The QOL-AD consists of 13 items that capture multiple aspects of a person's quality of life in the context of dementia. It can also be used to examine the quality of life of family members of persons with dementia. Participants rate on a 5-point scale from poor to excellent the degree to which they feel about different aspects of their life (e.g. physical health, energy, mood, memory, family). Sum scores can range from 13 to 65 with higher scores meaning higher quality of life.</description>
