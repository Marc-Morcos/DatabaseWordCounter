  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the aging population, the prevalence of dementia is increasing dramatically. People&#xD;
      living with dementia are highly dependent on family care partners, who may have little&#xD;
      knowledge of the disorder. National and provincial guidelines have all highlighted the&#xD;
      importance of online resources to improve care partner education; however, very few have been&#xD;
      widely implemented or rigorously studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed the award-winning dementia education platform to complement&#xD;
      traditional patient and family educational approaches. It allows free access to multimedia&#xD;
      e-learning lessons, live expert webinars, and email-based content that care partners can&#xD;
      access any time, anywhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), the investigators propose to study 1) the&#xD;
      feasibility and care partner acceptance of the intervention and some of the study methods,&#xD;
      and 2) the impact of the intervention on care partner self-efficacy, knowledge, and sense of&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initiative has the potential to improve the quality, cost effectiveness, and efficiency&#xD;
      of dementia care. The intervention could be easily scaled and spread both provincially and&#xD;
      nationally to complement other dementia education methods, at a time when the prevalence of&#xD;
      dementia is increasing and access to high quality internet-based interventions is essential.&#xD;

    <time_frame>0, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy will be measured through the Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy (RSCSE) (reliability α = &gt;.80). The RSCSE contains 15 items within 3 subscales (self-efficacy for obtaining respite, responding to disruptive patient behaviours, and controlling upsetting thoughts about caregiving). Higher scores indicate a higher level of self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS) at 8 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge will be measured through the Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS) (reliability α = .85; ωh = .87; overall scale). The DKAS consists of 25 items on different aspects of dementia that could be answered with 'True,' 'Probably True,' 'False, 'Probably False,' or 'I don't know.' Higher scores indicate a higher level of dementia knowledge.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) at 8 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Burden will be measured through the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) (reliability α = .92). The ZBI contains 22 items. Each item on the interview is a statement which the caregiver is asked to endorse using a 5-point scale. Response options range from 0 (Never) to 4 (Nearly Always). Higher scores indicate a higher level of burden.</description>

Ten selected multimedia e-learning lessons;&#xD;
A series of 16 'micro-learning' emails (2 emails/week) with small segments of content to reinforce the material from the lessons.&#xD;
Participants will have 8-weeks to complete the intervention. The total time to complete is approximately 5-6 hours.</description>
