      The purpose of this study is to determine whether tryptophan is effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The clinical trial will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with patients being&#xD;
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio into groups A and B, respectively:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: TRP01 1g b.i.d. for 26 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: placebo capsules b.i.d. for 26 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial screening, clinic visits will take place at 0, 13 and 26 weeks. The&#xD;
      blinding will be maintained until all patients have completed the 26-week trial. Any patients&#xD;
      wishing to continue taking the medication upon completion of the trial will be provided a&#xD;
      prescription for the drug and may purchase it at their own expense.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients will be selected in order to fulfill both of the following definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dementia according to DSM-IV criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  development of multiple cognitive deficits manifested by both memory impairment&#xD;
                  and one or more of the following cognitive disturbances: aphasia, apraxia,&#xD;
                  agnosia, disturbance in executive functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  the above-mentioned deficits cause significant impairment in social or&#xD;
                  occupational functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  they do not occur exclusively during the course of delirium&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  dementia established clinically and documented by a Folstein Mini-Mental State&#xD;
                  Examination (MMSE)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  deficits in two or more areas of cognition&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  progressive worsening of memory and other cognitive functions&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  no disturbance of consciousness&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absence of systematic disorders or other brain diseases that in and of themselves&#xD;
                  can account for progressive deficit in memory and cognition&#xD;
&#xD;
        Furthermore, patients must fulfill the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  men, or postmenopausal or surgically sterilized women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with severity of dementia of mild to moderate degree as reflected by a score of&#xD;
             greater than 14 but less than 26 on the MMSE&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with a minimum one-year duration of the symptomatology (progressive worsening of&#xD;
             memory and other cognitive functions)&#xD;
&#xD;
