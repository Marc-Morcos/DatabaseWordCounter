      Pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a pilot embedded pragmatic cluster randomized&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposed investigation is to assess the feasibility of a pilot&#xD;
      embedded pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (ePCT) to reduce the duration of&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy and number of antibiotic prescriptions among nursing home residents with&#xD;
      AD/ADRD. With the support of three independently owned and operated nursing homes that are&#xD;
      unaffiliated with an academic medical center, we have developed the multicomponent&#xD;
      intervention, eCARE-ID (Electronic Consultation for AD/ADRD Residents Experiencing Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases). eCARE-ID consists of three components: 1) Tele-ID video clinical consultation&#xD;
      services for nursing home residents; 2) electronic consultation (e-consultation) services for&#xD;
      healthcare personnel at participating nursing homes; and 3) Tele-ID video antibiotic&#xD;
      stewardship services for healthcare personnel including pharmacists at participating nursing&#xD;
      homes.&#xD;
