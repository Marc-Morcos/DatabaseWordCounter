  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers propose to develop an informatics system to assist people with memory&#xD;
      impairment. Persons with Memory Concern (PWMC) recognize the faces they see daily, such as a&#xD;
      spouse or caregiver, but they may confuse visiting friends and grandchildren or they may not&#xD;
      match names with faces well. The inability to remember names or relationships contributes to&#xD;
      isolation and deeply affects their social lives. The proposed solution is a Smartwatch&#xD;
      Reminder (SR) system to conspicuously provide this information to the PWMC when needed. The&#xD;
      system will be evaluated on the target persons with memory concern population to measure&#xD;
      engagement and improvements in social interactions and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research will evaluate technology designed to improve the quality of life for persons&#xD;
      with dementia through external aids to assist with remembering. The primary goal of the&#xD;
      Smartwatch Reminder (SR) is to facilitate social interaction for Persons with Memory Concern&#xD;
      (PWMC) by providing facial recognition of family, friends, and other key people. The SR will&#xD;
      be evaluated using an embedded experimental mixed methods design that combines the collection&#xD;
      and analysis of qualitative data within a traditional randomized controlled trial design. To&#xD;
      do so, researchers will enroll 100 PWMC and their care partners to participate in initial,&#xD;
      3-month, and 6-month surveys. Half of the PWMCs will be randomly assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      group (i.e. receive the SR) and the other half randomly assigned to the attention control&#xD;
      group. Each participant will take part in the study for a total of 6 months. All study&#xD;
      procedures and data analysis are anticipated to be completed within 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>The PWMC and Care partner in this group will receive the SR. The project will provide a smartwatch and smartphone for the dyads in the study. All others (family, friends, etc.) will be able to download a smartphone app from an online store. Instructional material will be created to show the suggested information that can be entered into the app. Care partners and PWMC are administered surveys at baseline, 3 months and 6 months following enrollment.</description>

    <description>Care partners are administered surveys at baseline, 3 months and 6 months following enrollment. The attention control group will receive a contact call from one of the researchers 3-months and 6-months after enrollment. Based on our prior experience, PWMC and care partners in an attention control group will often seek information and psychosocial support during these calls. We will provide free information resources (e.g., brochures or websites of the Alzheimer's Association) at that time.</description>
