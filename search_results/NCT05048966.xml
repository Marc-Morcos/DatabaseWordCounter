  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5.3 million people live with a long-term disability resulting from a traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury (TBI) and between 5-8% of those older than 60 suffer from Alzheimer's disease or&#xD;
      other forms of dementia (ADRD). Consequences of these conditions can result in dramatic and&#xD;
      persistent changes in functioning, impacting not only the patients, but also loved ones who&#xD;
      become informal support persons. Many existing services help the family in the moment, but do&#xD;
      not address long-term wellness. Thus, the purpose of this research study is to compare the&#xD;
      effect of two different types of group wellness treatments for individuals with chronic mild&#xD;
      TBI, moderate to severe TBI, and ADRD and their support persons.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve three sites, with a different clinical population targeted at each&#xD;
      site. Kessler Foundation will serve as the Coordinating Center and will enroll individuals&#xD;
      with moderate/severe TBI. Franciscan Health in Indiana and University of Michigan will serve&#xD;
      as partnering sites and will enroll individuals with chronic mild TBI and ADRD respectively.&#xD;
      The research protocols at each site will be unique to the patient population, but harmonized&#xD;
      through unified project goals: 1) to evaluate the efficacy of two different online group&#xD;
      wellness treatments designed to improve self-efficacy and quality of life, and 2) to&#xD;
      determine whether patient neurobehavioral functioning moderates the relationship between&#xD;
      treatment outcomes and burden in caregivers, and 3) to determine the neural, behavioral, and&#xD;
      blood biomarkers that best predict treatment efficacy. It is expected that findings generated&#xD;
      from this study will lead to improved holistic approaches for brain injury and dementia&#xD;
      systems of care.&#xD;
