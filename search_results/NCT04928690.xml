  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The S22 study investigates, in a cross-sectional study, the ability of algorithms that&#xD;
      analyse acoustic and linguistic patterns of spoken language to predict the presence of&#xD;
      amyloid positivity in early stage Alzheimer's disease, specifically in Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) cohorts; and whether similar algorithms can&#xD;
      predict cognitive functioning, in classifying MCI vs CN.&#xD;
