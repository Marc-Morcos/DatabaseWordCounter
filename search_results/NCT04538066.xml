      To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and long-term efficacy of bryostatin 1 (hereafter&#xD;
      referred to as bryostatin) for the treatment of moderately severe Alzheimer's disease (AD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study comparing bryostatin-1 to&#xD;
      placebo for long-term efficacy in the treatment of moderately severe AD (Mini Mental State&#xD;
      Examination, 2nd edition scores of 10-18 at baseline) in the absence of memantine. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will receive 7 doses of bryostatin (i.v., 20μg) or matching placebo during the first&#xD;
      12 weeks. A second course of treatment consisting of 7 doses will begin 30 days after the&#xD;
      final dose of the first treatment period. Cognitive tests will be assessed at intervals&#xD;
      during the study and 4 months after the final dose of study drug. The primary endpoint is the&#xD;
      total SIB score assessment obtained at Week 28, following completion of 2 courses of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The treatment difference in the primary efficacy endpoint of Severe Impairment Battery (SIB). The SIB is used to assess cognition in subjects with moderate and severe AD. It is divided into nine subscales that include attention, language, orientation, memory, praxis, visuospatial ability, construction, social skills, orienting head to name. Non-verbal responses are allowed, thus decreasing the need for language output. Forty questions are included with a point score range of 0-100. Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.</description>
