  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive aging is a major source of disability in an increasingly aging population. The&#xD;
      paucity of effective treatments for cognitive aging disorders, and most importantly in&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease instigates a need for further research into novel therapeutic&#xD;
      possibilities. Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and its&#xD;
      prevalence steeply increases. Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in neuropsychiatric disorders&#xD;
      and in particular in Alzheimer's disease has been shown to cause significant cerebral damage.&#xD;
      Early effective therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease is critical in order to&#xD;
      prevent or at least slow down neuropathological progression that will lead to widespread&#xD;
      irreversible neuronal loss and significant cognitive dysfunction. Riluzole, a glutamate&#xD;
      modulator agent, will be tested in mild Alzheimer's disease patients. Cognitive functional&#xD;
      changes along with two established in vivo biomarkers, namely, Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Spectroscopy (MRS) and Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be performed. Forty-two&#xD;
      individuals with a diagnosis of mild Alzheimer's disease between 50-95 years old will&#xD;
      complete the study. All forty-two individuals will have been on an acetylcholinesterase&#xD;
      inhibitor, which is FDA approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, for at least 2&#xD;
      months prior to initiating the study, unless the medication was not previously tolerated.&#xD;
      Twenty to twenty-two mild Alzheimer's disease patients will receive riluzole and another&#xD;
      20-22 will receive a placebo. All patients will have a neurological evaluation and&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests performed to confirm that they meet criteria for probable&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease set out by the National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      Association that recently revisited the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria along with FDG-PET biomarker&#xD;
      consistent with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

    <measure>Imaging Biomarkers FDG-PET SUVR in Regions of Interest</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to 6 months in cerebral glucose metabolism measured with FDG PET in posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, precuneus, and medial temporal, lateral temporal, inferior parietal, and frontal lobes, referred to collectively as our pre-specified regions of interest.&#xD;
Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging procedure that measures glucose metabolism in the brain.It is a well-established Alzheimer's disease biomarker and predictor of disease progression. For each FDG PET scan, 5 mCi of fluorodeoxyglucose was administered followed by a 40 minute uptake period during which the participant was in a resting state. Images were acquired on a Siemens Biograph 64mCT scanner as a series of 4 frames of 5 minutes each. Using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust), motion correction was performed and frames averaged into a static image. Each 6 month scan was coregistered to the baseline FDG scan, which was co-registered to the participant's T1-weighted MRI scan.</description>

    <measure>Imaging Biomarkers N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in Posterior Cingulate (PC) Measured Through 1H MRS</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is a neuronal viability marker measured through magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS).In vivo brain levels of NAA, glutamate, tCr and other major metabolites were obtained using 1H MRS and a 2x2x2-cm3 Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PC) voxel of interest in approximately 6.5 minutes using the constant-time point-resolved spectroscopy (CT-PRESS) technique with TE 30 ms, 129 constant-time increments (t1) of 0.8ms, and TR 1500 ms and a receive-only 8-channel phased-array head coil.The levels of NAA and other metabolites were expressed semi-quantitatively as ratios of peak areas relative to that of the unsuppressed water signal (W) from the same voxels. For consistency with earlier MRS literature, levels of the same metabolites were also expressed as peak ratios relative to tCr area in the same voxel.</description>

    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) - Cognitive Subscale (ADAScog)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAS comprises two subscales, cognitive and non-cognitive. The Cognitive Subscale (ADAScog) is a psychometric instrument that includes 11 tasks and evaluates memory, attention, reasoning, language, orientation, and praxis, scored from 0 to 70. The full ADAS total is scored by summing the number of errors made on each task on a range from 0 to 150 so that higher scores indicate worse performance.The non-cognitive component was not used in this study. Obtained for correlation with neuroimaging biomarkers.</description>

        <title>Imaging Biomarkers FDG-PET SUVR in Regions of Interest</title>
        <description>Change from baseline to 6 months in cerebral glucose metabolism measured with FDG PET in posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, precuneus, and medial temporal, lateral temporal, inferior parietal, and frontal lobes, referred to collectively as our pre-specified regions of interest.&#xD;
Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging procedure that measures glucose metabolism in the brain.It is a well-established Alzheimer's disease biomarker and predictor of disease progression. For each FDG PET scan, 5 mCi of fluorodeoxyglucose was administered followed by a 40 minute uptake period during which the participant was in a resting state. Images were acquired on a Siemens Biograph 64mCT scanner as a series of 4 frames of 5 minutes each. Using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust), motion correction was performed and frames averaged into a static image. Each 6 month scan was coregistered to the baseline FDG scan, which was co-registered to the participant's T1-weighted MRI scan.</description>

        <title>Imaging Biomarkers N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in Posterior Cingulate (PC) Measured Through 1H MRS</title>
        <description>N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is a neuronal viability marker measured through magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS).In vivo brain levels of NAA, glutamate, tCr and other major metabolites were obtained using 1H MRS and a 2x2x2-cm3 Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PC) voxel of interest in approximately 6.5 minutes using the constant-time point-resolved spectroscopy (CT-PRESS) technique with TE 30 ms, 129 constant-time increments (t1) of 0.8ms, and TR 1500 ms and a receive-only 8-channel phased-array head coil.The levels of NAA and other metabolites were expressed semi-quantitatively as ratios of peak areas relative to that of the unsuppressed water signal (W) from the same voxels. For consistency with earlier MRS literature, levels of the same metabolites were also expressed as peak ratios relative to tCr area in the same voxel.</description>
        <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
        <population>Some participants could not complete MRS study due to multiple reasons (eg could not tolerate lengthy exam, did not return to visit etc) or did complete it but quality control of the MRS spectra did not pass screening criteria for analysis.</population>

        <title>Glutamate Levels Measured Through 1H MRS</title>
        <description>In vivo measurement of glutamate with 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (a neuroimaging study) in posterior cingulate as a marker of target engagement at three and six months compared to baseline.In vivo brain levels of glutamate, tCr and other major metabolites were obtained using 1H MRS and a 2x2x2-cm3 Posterior Cingulate Cortex voxel of interest in approximately 6.5 minutes using the constant-time point-resolved spectroscopy (CT-PRESS) technique with TE 30 ms, 129 constant-time increments (t1) of 0.8ms, and TR 1500 ms and a receive-only 8-channel phased-array head coil.The levels of glutamate and other metabolites were expressed semi-quantitatively as ratios of peak areas relative to that of the unsuppressed water signal (W) from the same voxels. For consistency with earlier MRS literature, levels of the same metabolites were also expressed as peak ratios relative to tCr area in the same voxel.</description>

        <population>Some participants could not complete MRS study due to multiple reasons (eg could not tolerate lengthy exam, did not return to visit etc) or did complete it but quality control of the MRS spectra did not pass screening criteria for analysis.</population>

        <title>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) - Cognitive Subscale (ADAScog)</title>
        <description>The ADAS comprises two subscales, cognitive and non-cognitive. The Cognitive Subscale (ADAScog) is a psychometric instrument that includes 11 tasks and evaluates memory, attention, reasoning, language, orientation, and praxis, scored from 0 to 70. The full ADAS total is scored by summing the number of errors made on each task on a range from 0 to 150 so that higher scores indicate worse performance.The non-cognitive component was not used in this study. Obtained for correlation with neuroimaging biomarkers.</description>

          <title>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) - Cognitive Subscale (ADAScog)</title>
          <description>The ADAS comprises two subscales, cognitive and non-cognitive. The Cognitive Subscale (ADAScog) is a psychometric instrument that includes 11 tasks and evaluates memory, attention, reasoning, language, orientation, and praxis, scored from 0 to 70. The full ADAS total is scored by summing the number of errors made on each task on a range from 0 to 150 so that higher scores indicate worse performance.The non-cognitive component was not used in this study. Obtained for correlation with neuroimaging biomarkers.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>1.Sample size was relatively small, and results require replication in larger-sample studies. 2.lack of amyloid characterization. 3.MRS is unable to differentiate neurotransmitter or vesicular and metabolic pools of glutamate. Longitudinal MRS measurements can be subject to technical variability and head motion. 4. the study was not powered for neuropsychological outcome and clinical changes must be viewed only as directional/exploratory.</limitations_and_caveats>
