      The purpose of this study is to collect and compare information regarding the treatment and&#xD;
      outcome of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease who are receiving either drug or&#xD;
      nondrug treatment. Information will be collected from patients and their primary caregivers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dementia is a chronic, progressive brain disease that may involve a number of symptoms,&#xD;
      including memory loss and changes in personality, behavior, judgment, attention span,&#xD;
      language and thought. The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Over time,&#xD;
      patients with Alzheimer's disease may lose ability to perform daily tasks related to personal&#xD;
      care (for example bathing, dressing, eating) and may be unable to handle money or travel to&#xD;
      familiar places. Dementia is one of the main reasons people are admitted to long-term care in&#xD;
      residential or nursing homes.Treatments or services that prevent or delay admission into&#xD;
      these institutions are important because they may help decrease or delay the use of health or&#xD;
      social care resources that are increasing in a growing elderly population.This study is a&#xD;
      large-scale survey that will provide information related to the treatment of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, including information regarding treatment patterns, characteristics of patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease, estimates of costs of care, disease outcomes, patients' ability to&#xD;
      function daily and quality of life for caregivers. This study will examine the current&#xD;
      management of patients with mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease in real life settings. As&#xD;
      opposed to a clinical trial in which a particular group of patients is selected to&#xD;
      participate and where treatments may be specified and possibly compared with a placebo (an&#xD;
      inactive substance), this study will include a wider variety of patients and treatment&#xD;
      options to more closely represent the management of Alzheimer's disease in current clinical&#xD;
      practice. Information will be collected from patients in Europe and other countries who are&#xD;
      being treated by a doctor for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Patients receiving&#xD;
      treatment with one of the following medications approved for treatment of Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (galantamine, donepezil, rivastigmine or tacrine) and patients receiving nondrug treatment&#xD;
      (disease progression monitoring, ginkgo extracts, Vitamin E, estrogen, etc) may participate.&#xD;
      No treatment or procedures will be specified and no medication will be provided by the&#xD;
      Sponsor of this study. Treatment of Alzheimer's disease may be stopped, started or changed by&#xD;
      the patients' individual doctors as appropriate. Information regarding disease status,&#xD;
      treatment, behavior, ability to function and use of social care services (day care, home&#xD;
      care, meals on wheels, social work) will be collected from patients. Information regarding&#xD;
      quality of sleep of the patient and caregiver, amount of care required by the patient and&#xD;
      well-being/general quality of life will be collected from caregivers. Information will be&#xD;
      collected every 6 months for a period of 2 years, with a possible additional follow-up period&#xD;
      of 2 years. If a patient in the study dies, the collection of information will stop. If a&#xD;
      patient in the study is permanently admitted to a supported care, nursing home or residential&#xD;
      care facility, collection of information will stop but follow-up with the caregiver will be&#xD;
      conducted at the end of the 2-year survey to determine if the patient is alive or deceased.&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that treatment of Alzheimer's disease with medication may improve&#xD;
      patient status, reduce caregiver dependency, improve caregiver quality of life, reduce the&#xD;
      amount of social care services needed and prolong or prevent admission to long-term&#xD;
      institutions of patients with Alzheimer's disease Since the study involves only collection of&#xD;
      information, no treatment will be required by the Sponsor and no medication will be supplied&#xD;
      by the Sponsor&#xD;
