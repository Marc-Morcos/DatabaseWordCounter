    <textblock>
      Hope Biosciences is conducting a research study of an investigational product called&#xD;
      autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (abbreviated as HB-adMSCs) as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study purpose is to evaluate the safety profile&#xD;
      of four IV infusions of HB-adMSCs in subjects with clinical diagnosis of AD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, non-randomized study in subjects with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
      24 patients will be enrolled for the study. The overall objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety profile of four IV infusions of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells (HB-adMSCs) in subjects with clinical diagnosis of AD. The primary endpoint of&#xD;
      this study is to measure the number and frequency of adverse event(s) and/or severe adverse&#xD;
      event(s) throughout the study duration. The second endpoint of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      ability of HB-adMSCs to alter AD-related inflammation via measuring levels of Tumor Necrosis&#xD;
      Factor alpha (TNF-a), Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP),&#xD;
      and markers associated with amyloid deposition, Amyloid beta 40 and Amyloid beta 42. Subjects&#xD;
      will also be assessed for cognitive deficits measured by changes from baseline values using&#xD;
      Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study Activities of&#xD;
      Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Alzheimer's disease Related Quality of Life (ADRQL), Altoida Neuro&#xD;
      Motor Index (NMI) for Digital Biomarkers, and Clinical Dementia Rating Questionnaire (CDR).&#xD;
