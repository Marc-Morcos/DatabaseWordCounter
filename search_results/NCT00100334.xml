  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, inpatient study followed by an outpatient,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, multiple-IV injection evaluation of the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      PPI-1019 in subjects with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary objective of&#xD;
      the study is to assess the safety of multiple IV injections of PPI-1019 in subjects with&#xD;
