  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CORT-X will examine if mitigation of stress-mediated pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD)&#xD;
      is a feasible target for intervention in individuals at risk for this disease. This&#xD;
      single-site (Baltimore, Maryland) phase II clinical trial is a 2-week, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled crossover study of the effects of the selective glucocorticoid receptor&#xD;
      antagonist, CORT108297, on cognitive test performance in 26 individuals with mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (MCI) due to AD and in 26 cognitively normal individuals with an increased risk&#xD;
      for AD due to family history, genetics, and/or subjective memory complaints. All subjects&#xD;
      will participate in a brief stressor (public speaking and mental arithmetic) and provide&#xD;
      saliva samples so investigators can measure stress hormone response. Then, following 2 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment with placebo or CORT108297, in counterbalanced order, participants will complete&#xD;
      cognitive tests assessing memory and executive function. All study participants will receive&#xD;
      CORT108297 and placebo over the course of this 10-week trial that requires 6 in-person study&#xD;
      visits. The primary aims will compare the effects of CORT108297 to placebo on cognitive test&#xD;
      performance in individuals with MCI due to AD and in individuals at risk for AD, and describe&#xD;
      the side effects of CORT108297 in study participants. Secondary aims will identify subject&#xD;
      characteristics that predict positive response to study drug.&#xD;
