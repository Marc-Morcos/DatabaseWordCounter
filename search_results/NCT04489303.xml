      The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate the Caring Response mobile app, containing&#xD;
      a training that builds skills and stimulates practice. The investigators are evaluating&#xD;
      different materials, which may encourage caregiver participation, enable user interaction,&#xD;
      and promote better assimilation of concepts. The research team is designing the program to&#xD;
      help to enhance caregivers' skills to deal with difficult behaviors, reduce distress, and&#xD;
      improve quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>This scale measures the type/number of dementia patients disturbing behaviors, and how much they bother caregivers with 24 items describing possible troublesome behaviors that the patient might evidence in the past month. Caregivers are first asked whether the dementia patient had displayed any of these in the time period, and secondly to rate on a 5-point scale (0=not at all; 4= extremely) how much this &quot;bothered or upset&quot; them. A &quot;conditional bother&quot; score is calculated which is the &quot;upset&quot; or &quot;bother&quot; ratings for only the problematic behavior that occurred. The scale refers to the caregiver. Minimum score (best value)=0. Maximum score (worst value)=4. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) is a 20-item measure that asks about the frequency of depressive symptoms (affective, psychological, and somatic) within the past week.The scale refers to the caregiver. Minimum score (best value)=0. Maximum score (worst value)=60. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The &quot;Perceived Stress Scale&quot; measures the overall level of stress. This instrument contains 10 items accessing overall appraisals of stress in the past month. The scale refers to the caregiver. Minimum score (best value)=0. Maximum score (worst value)=40. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
