  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As of today, there is no FDA-approved treatment for agitation in AD. Hence, it is still&#xD;
      considered an unmet need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sporadic observation in healthy or diagnosed individuals indicated that cannabis products, in&#xD;
      particular, THC have calming and anti-anxiety effects. These observations are supported by&#xD;
      basic science data as well as animal experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCI -110 is a combination of (1) dronabinol, the active ingredient in an FDA-approved&#xD;
      synthetic analog of tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive molecule in the cannabis plant,&#xD;
      and (2) palmitoylethanolamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the starting daily dose for all subjects is 2.5 mg dronabinol and 800&#xD;
      mg PEA and will be gradually increased (every 3 days an addition of 2.5 mg dronabinol per&#xD;
      day, with no change in the PEA dose) to a maximum of 12.5 mg Dronebinol and 800 mg PEA per&#xD;
      day. The study product will be given orally, twice daily, to add-on the medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration per patient is up to 64 days: a. screening (3-21 days); b. treatment phase:&#xD;
      (1) titration (15-23 days) of dronabinol from 2.5 to 12.5 mg or up to the maximal subject's&#xD;
      tolerated dose (2) Stabilization phase (10 days) until end of treatment on the highest&#xD;
      subject's daily tolerated dose. c. follow-up phase (7 days) - until the end-of-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the tolerability of the drug, its safety (vital signs, physical&#xD;
      examinations, blood, and urine tests and side effects follow-up) as well as changes in&#xD;
      subject's condition (using CMAI, MMSE, SIB-8 questionnaires), appetite and sleep quality&#xD;
      (SDI) will be followed.&#xD;
