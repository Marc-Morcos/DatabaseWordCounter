  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent clinical data showed that patients with Alzheimer Disease (AD) might present epilepsy&#xD;
      at early stages of the disease (Cretin et al., 2016, Vossel et al., 2016). In mice models of&#xD;
      Alzheimer disease, preclinical researchers observed an increase of epileptic events during&#xD;
      Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, which is very unusual. This study aims at testing if patients&#xD;
      with AD present an exacerbation of epileptic events during REM sleep, which could constitute&#xD;
      an early biomarker of the disease. Investigators will evaluate the incidence of epilepsy&#xD;
      during each sleep stage in 40 patients with early or moderate forms of AD and in 40 healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Investigators will also look for a link between epilepsy during sleep in AD&#xD;
      participants and memory performances, brain damage (by using MRI scans) and in the case of&#xD;
      patients, the phenotype of the Apolipoprotein E(ApoE) gene.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical researchers discovered that the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer Disease (AD)&#xD;
      presents epileptiform activity specifically during sleep, with a prominent increase during&#xD;
      REM-sleep. This phenotype is specific to AD mice since REM-sleep usually prevents seizures&#xD;
      and epileptiform activity in animal models of epilepsy. Preclinical research also evidenced&#xD;
      that this epileptic phenotype occurs at very early age in Tg2576 mice, far before the onset&#xD;
      of cognitive impairments. Thus, it was hypothesized that patients with AD might present&#xD;
      subclinical epileptiform events during sleep with a potential worsening during REM-sleep. If&#xD;
      so, it could be used as a specific and early biomarker of AD. Since sleep is involved in&#xD;
      memory consolidation processes, preclinical researchers also hypothesized that epileptiform&#xD;
      events during sleep might participate to cognitive dysfunction in AD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test this hypothesis, a monocentric clinical study with a protocol consisting of&#xD;
      three visits was designed aiming at evaluating seizures and subclinical epileptiform activity&#xD;
      - and their consequences on memory - during sleep in 31 patients at early to moderate stages&#xD;
      of AD and 31 matched healthy participants. During the first visit, a blood sample is&#xD;
      collected of each patient for genetic testing of the ApoE gene before they undergo a&#xD;
      high-resolution MRI scan. During the second visit (in the 60 days following the first one)&#xD;
      participants first undergo a neuropsychological evaluation including visual, verbal and&#xD;
      episodic memory tests before an overnight polysomnography. Following the overnight&#xD;
      polysomnography, all subjects (patients and healthy participants) will be tested for the&#xD;
      memories acquired the day before in order to evaluate sleep related memory consolidation.&#xD;
      During the last visit, participants will fill out questionnaires aiming at evaluating&#xD;
      pre-diagnostic lifestyle and they (and one family member if possible) will be interviewed&#xD;
      about the presence of symptoms that might indicate an underlying epileptic syndrome for the&#xD;
      participant. Healthy subjects will undergo the same procedures except for the blood test from&#xD;
      which they will be exempted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This should allow to evidence sleep related epileptic events, to precise their incidence in&#xD;
      AD patients as well as in healthy participants, and to correlate these events to anomalies in&#xD;
      brain structure and functional resting state connectivity (MRI) and/or sleep disturbances&#xD;
      and/or cognitive decline.&#xD;
