  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of Americans have late-stage Alzheimer's and related dementias (ADRD), causing&#xD;
      suffering due to loss of awareness of self and family, progressive dependency, physical and&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms, and physical, emotional and financial strain for caregivers.&#xD;
      Investigators now propose a multi-site randomized clinical trial of the ADRD Palliative Care&#xD;
      (ADRD-PC) program for persons with late-stage ADRD and their family caregivers, triggered&#xD;
      during hospitalization. Investigators aim to learn if this program of dementia-specific&#xD;
      palliative care, standardized caregiver education, and transitional care is effective to&#xD;
      reduce burdensome hospital transfers, improve symptom treatment and control, augment&#xD;
      supportive services, and reduce nursing home transitions for patients, and to improve&#xD;
      caregiver outcomes of communication, shared decision-making and distress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators have designed the ADRD Palliative Care (ADRD-PC) program of dementia-specific&#xD;
      palliative and transitional care, and shown its feasibility and potential efficacy. Delivered&#xD;
      by interdisciplinary hospital palliative care teams, ADRD-PC addresses 1) prognostic&#xD;
      awareness, 2) symptom management, 3) shared decision-making, and 4) transition to community&#xD;
      support services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research objective is to conduct a multi-site efficacy randomized clinical trial (RCT) of&#xD;
      the ADRD-PC program. Investigators will enroll 424 dyads of hospitalized patients with&#xD;
      late-stage ADRD (Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) 6-7 or GDS 5 with significant co-morbidity)&#xD;
      with their family caregivers at 4 geographically diverse sites of the Palliative Care&#xD;
      Research Cooperative group - University of North Carolina, University of Colorado,&#xD;
      Massachusetts General Hospital (Harvard University), and Indiana University. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that ADRD-PC will reduce hospital transfers (Aim 1). Additional hypotheses are&#xD;
      that ADRD-PC will improve patient-centered outcomes of symptom treatment, symptom control,&#xD;
      use of community palliative care or hospice, and nursing home transitions (Aim 2); and&#xD;
      caregiver outcomes of communication, decision-making and distress (Aim 3).&#xD;

    <masking_description>Randomization allocation to study arms is concealed from all study personnel until the point of randomization assignment.&#xD;
In the ADRD-PC Study, the overall PI (Dr. Hanson) and the research staff Clinical Research Coordinators (CRC) collecting data in 30- and 60-day interviews (data source for primary outcome and most secondary outcomes) are masked to study assignment until planned study arm reveal during final analyses. CRCs will conduct 60-day electronic health record (EHR) reviews only after dyads complete study participation, as EHR content has the potential to reveal study arm assignment. As with most behavioral clinical interventions, participants and care providers cannot be masked.</masking_description>
