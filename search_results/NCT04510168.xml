  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aging of the United States (US) population will lead to a steep rise in Alzheimer disease&#xD;
      (AD). There is an urgent need for novel therapies that may tackle this looming societal&#xD;
      problem. People with Alzheimer disease have frequently evidence of vascular disease in the&#xD;
      brain, and vascular disease can increase the risk of Alzheimer disease. Based on this&#xD;
      finding, the investigators plan to expand the understanding of how vascular disease&#xD;
      contributes to Alzheimer disease, hoping to identify novel target to modify the natural&#xD;
      progression of the disease. The investigators will accomplish this goal by inviting 300&#xD;
      participants (with and without dementia) of the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS) to undergo a&#xD;
      brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and donate blood. Of the 300 participants enrolled, 60&#xD;
      participants will be randomly selected to undergo Aβ and tau positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the brain MRI, the investigators will obtain measurements of cerebrovascular disease and&#xD;
      relate the to the risk of Alzheimer disease. With the blood, the investigators hope to&#xD;
      identify measures of aging and inflammation that may predict changes noted in brain scan and&#xD;
      identify people at a higher risk of dementia. The investigators will examine PET markers of&#xD;
      inflammation and aging in the brain and how the markers relate to dementia.&#xD;

      Research about non-atherosclerotic BAA and its effects on cognition has been hampered by the&#xD;
      lack of high-resolution arterial wall imaging, the preponderance of research focused on&#xD;
      intracranial large artery atherosclerosis (ILAA) and the lack of mechanistic studies. This&#xD;
      study aims to address these shortcomings. By using high-resolution brain arterial wall&#xD;
      imaging in participants in the NOMAS cohort, the investigators will derive a wall-based&#xD;
      measure of non-atherosclerotic BAA and relate it to pre-MRI cognitive trajectories, AD risk,&#xD;
      and ipsilateral markers of neurodegeneration including Aβ/tau PET imaging.&#xD;

    <measure>Association Between Non-Atherosclerotic Brain Arterial Aging (BAA) and Prevalent Alzheimer's' Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Calculation of the effect size (estimated beta=0.024 +/- 0.0008) of the association between non-atherosclerotic brain arterial aging (BAA) and prevalent Alzheimer's' disease. Each artery forming the circle of Willis and the vertebral arteries will be rated for measuring wall thickness, lumen diameter, lumen-to-wall ratio, and pattern of thickness. The investigators will use spline regression plots to inform the best cutoff to define &quot;thickened arterial wall&quot; and &quot;dilated artery&quot; (based on time of flight MRA). The BAA score will be the sum of three variables: presence of thickened wall, dilated artery, and concentric wall thickening.</description>

        The population targeted in this aim comes from the long-established NOMAS study, an&#xD;
        ongoing, prospective, population-based cohort of 3,298 stroke-free participants. Cohort&#xD;
        recruitment occurred from 1993 to 2001. Initial eligibility for the cohort included those&#xD;
        aged &gt; 40 years who were permanent residents of Northern Manhattan, lived in a house with a&#xD;
        telephone, and had no history of clinical stroke. NOMAS participants were recruited during&#xD;
        annual follow-ups to undergo a brain MRI if they met the following criteria: free of&#xD;
        clinical stroke, aged &gt;50 years, and could have an MRI.&#xD;
