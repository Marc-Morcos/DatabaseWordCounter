    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is find out how safe a single dose of bryostatin 1 is in&#xD;
      patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This study is also being done 1) to determine how&#xD;
      effective a single dose of bryostatin 1 is in the treatment of AD, 2) to find out what&#xD;
      happens to bryostatin 1 once it enters the body by measuring the levels of bryostatin 1 in&#xD;
      blood, and 3) to measure a substance in the blood (protein kinase C) that may help to better&#xD;
      understand how bryostatin 1 works.&#xD;
