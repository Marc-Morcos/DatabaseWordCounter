      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this proposal are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the dynamic uptake and washout of 123-I AV151, a potential imaging biomarker for&#xD;
      β-amyloid burden in brain, using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in&#xD;
      similarly aged healthy controls and Alzheimer's (AD) subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform blood metabolite characterization of 123-I AV151 in healthy and AD subjects to&#xD;
      determine the metabolic fate and nature of metabolites in assessment of 123-I AV151 as a&#xD;
      single photon computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the test/retest reproducibility of 123-I AV151 and SPECT in AD subjects and healthy&#xD;
      controls&#xD;

      General Design and Methods. The underlying goal of this study is to assess 123-I AV151 SPECT&#xD;
      imaging as a tool to detect ß-amyloid deposition in the brain of AD research participants and&#xD;
      age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. All study procedures will be conducted at the&#xD;
      Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders (IND) and Molecular NeuroImaging (MNI) in New&#xD;
      Haven, CT. Approximately 20 patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) and 10 healthy controls&#xD;
      will be recruited to participate in this study. Healthy controls will be examined to ensure&#xD;
      that there is no evidence of neurodegenerative changes including cognitive decline. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained for all. All subjects will undergo a screening evaluation including&#xD;
      baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline physical and neurological evaluation and&#xD;
      baseline cognitive evaluations. Subjects will be asked to undergo a bolus injection of 123-I&#xD;
      AV151. Subjects will undergo serial SPECT imaging scans and serial venous plasma sampling for&#xD;
      measurement of 123-I AV151 in plasma (both protein bound and free) over a period of up to 6&#xD;
      hours. Subjects may be asked to undergo a second imaging visit between 2 and 6 weeks&#xD;
      following the initial imaging visit following similar procedures to the initial imaging visit&#xD;
      to evaluate the reproducibility of the imaging measure using this procedure. The imaging&#xD;
      analyses will be performed by an image-processing specialist who will remain masked to the&#xD;
      procedures employed with each imaging acquisition. The primary imaging outcome measure will&#xD;
      be the brain regional distribution volumes expressed as a brain tissue to plasma ratio of the&#xD;
      radioligand, 123-I AV151. Time to the peak uptake and amplitude of the peak uptake will be&#xD;
      evaluated for all brain regions and the results for the AD patients and controls will be&#xD;
      compared. For those subjects undergoing repeat imaging visits, the data from the initial scan&#xD;
      will be compared to the second scan to determine which offers the reproducibility of the&#xD;
      imaging outcome measure.&#xD;
