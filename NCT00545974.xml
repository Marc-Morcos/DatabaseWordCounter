  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether memantine is effective in slowing&#xD;
      the rate of behavioral decline in frontotemporal dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of long-term&#xD;
      treatment with memantine in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or semantic dementia&#xD;
      (SD). To determine whether memantine is effective in slowing the rate of cognitive decline in&#xD;
      frontotemporal dementia. To evaluate whether memantine delays or decreases the emergence of&#xD;
      parkinsonism in frontotemporal dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tertiary objective of the study is to determine whether treatment with memantine affects&#xD;
      changes in weight&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of memantine 10 mg&#xD;
      twice daily versus placebo, at a ratio of 1:1, to receive active drug or placebo. Screening&#xD;
      and enrollment is planned to last approximately one year. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board,&#xD;
      consisting of a clinical pharmacist and 3 neurologists will review all AE reports&#xD;
      approximately every 3 months after study initiation. The DSMB will notify the principal&#xD;
      investigator, the study sponsor and the CHR if significant concerns are raised by their&#xD;
      review of the AE data. An interim analysis of efficacy data will be conducted after 50% of&#xD;
      the targeted enrollment population has completed 26 weeks of drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Including screening and off-drug follow up, each subject will participate in the study for&#xD;
      approximately 34 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire study is anticipated to last 86 weeks if enrollment is completed within one year&#xD;
      of study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The targeted enrollment is 140.&#xD;

    <description>NPI:12-domain caregiver assessment of behavioral disturbances occurring in dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, appetite/eating, nighttime behavior. A screening question is asked about each sub-domain. If the responses to these questions indicate that the patient has problems with a particular sub-domain of behavior, the caregiver is only then asked all the questions about that domain, rating the frequency of the symptoms on a 4-point scale, their severity on a 3-point scale, and the distress the symptom causes them on a 5-point scale. Severity(1=Mild to 3=Severe),frequency(1=occasionally to 4=very frequently) scales recorded for each domain; frequency*severity=each domain score(range 0-12). Total score=sum of each domain score(range 0-144);higher score=greater behavioral disturbances;negative change score from baseline=improvement.</description>

Digit symbol, score is number of symbols that correctly corresponded to the random numerals entered in the form in 90 seconds. Participants are given a table of numerals with matching symbols, and a form with random numerals with open spaces. Low scores indicate high impairment.&#xD;
Digits backwards, score is number of digits backwards recalled (range: 0-14), The participant hears a list of digits and is asked to repeat the digits backwards. Low scores indicate high impairment.</description>

A screening question is asked about each sub-domain. If the responses to these questions indicate that the patient has problems with a particular sub-domain of behavior, the caregiver is only then asked all the questions about that domain, rating the frequency of the symptoms on a 4-point scale, their severity on a 3-point scale, and the distress the symptom causes them on a 5-point scale. Severity(1=Mild to 3=Severe),frequency(1=occasionally to 4=very frequently) scales recorded for each domain; frequency*severity=each domain score(range 0-12). Total score=sum of each domain score(range 0-144);higher score=greater behavioral disturbances;negative change score from baseline=improvement.</description>

        <description>Letter fluency, score is number of words recalled starting with a specified letter for 60 seconds. There are 3 trials, with 3 different letters. The total number of correct responses is totaled for all 3 trials for the score. Low scores indicate high impairment&#xD;
Category fluency, score is number of items generated belonging to a specific category (such as animals) in 60 seconds, low scores indicate high impairment.&#xD;
Digit symbol, score is number of symbols that correctly corresponded to the random numerals entered in the form in 90 seconds. Participants are given a table of numerals with matching symbols, and a form with random numerals with open spaces. Low scores indicate high impairment.&#xD;
Digits backwards, score is number of digits backwards recalled (range: 0-14), The participant hears a list of digits and is asked to repeat the digits backwards. Low scores indicate high impairment.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Lower enrollment than planned may have limited ability detect a treatment effect; Small size of semantic dementia group limits generalizability of results to FTD syndrome; Newer tools have been developed to better capture FTD-specific behaviors.</limitations_and_caveats>
